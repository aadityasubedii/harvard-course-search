The exams (midterm and final) are also very fair – as long as you paid attention during lecture, you will do well. The final essay provides a lot of freedom to more deeply explore any archaeological site you are interested in, and the checkpoint assignments (annotated bibliography, outline) ensure you don't procrastinate and receive feedback before the full essay is due.

If you’ve never taken an archaeology class before, this is a beginner–friendly class that will be interesting to anyone, concentrator or not.The workload in this class is not nonexistent, but it’s not busywork either and is a reasonable amount. The readings are relevant and reasonable length, and there are few assignments besides the readings since the majority of the grade is attendance and the three exams, which you review for in the class, and are pretty easy to do well on if you study. The three exams does include the final, and this class doesn’t pull the last–week midterm business, which I always appreciate. The class itself is fun, since Professor Liebmann’s teaching is engaging and he is always willing to answer questions as much as he can. The section is often an interactive activity, and the last section of the class is a spear–throwing accuracy contest (which would sell me on the class by itself because when else do you get to do that?)"

      "Take this course take this course take this course. If you are a senior in your last semester, take this course. If you're a freshman in your first semester, take this course. If you're a burned out junior with no idea what to add as a fourth course, take this course.  Julia makes everyone feel like they belong in the class. Even though reading your first ethnography (you might not know what that is) might be difficult if you've never studied anthropology before, you will get the hang of it. The assigned readings are totally do–able week to week. It's not like other classes where they throw you 300 pages a week. There are a few lengthy readings, but truth be told, I got away without doing 2 of the reading assignments completely. It's obviously pretty clear when you haven't done the reading since most of the class does it, and Julia remembers every small detail from the readings. But still, the readings are actually a lot of fun and the historical relevance and analysis of the gift as a social phenomenon is just such a cool concept to study. And you're not treated like you're in high school. There are no pop quizzes like some other classes have or silly, ineffective weekly discussion posts on Canvas. This is how class usually goes if you're curious. 1.) Julia asks the class what they thought about the reading. Folks can raise their hand and answer. 2.) Someone gives their presentation on the reading. Each person has to give one presentation during the semester. Super casual. Just summarizing the reading and your analytical insights about it. 3.) We discuss that person's presentation. Usually answer some discussion questions. 4.) Julia takes it away with her analysis and leads a discussion. 4.) Class dismissed! Julia's office hours are also very easy to attend because she has them both on Zoom and in person. I probably attended once every three weeks, and they were helpful just for talking about the readings, bouncing off ideas for a paper, and even just chatting generally. I never used to go to my professors' office hours, but I took this class senior spring and decided that I wanted to change that during my last semester. It was so worth it and easy to attend office hours. Do it! If you end up taking the class, these are the readings that I thought were the most powerful: Mauss, Taussig, Bataille, Derrida, Caillois, Scheper–Hughes, Chu, Tsing, Han, Simmel. These are the readings that I thought were least important to the course theme (maybe worth sacrificing if you're short on time): Mbembe and Martinez Ruiz (I wrote a paper on this author's work but only realized afterwards how weak the author's argument is), I hope you take the class. If you're at all interested in the course description, you should definitely give it a try. You will love it!"

      "Highly recommend this course if you're interested in public service/thinking about working for a nonprofit! The teaching staff is great (both Andi and Ami care a lot and they're such kind, smart people). A big portion of the class is that you partner with an organization of your choice to work on a project that benefits a specific community (I know it sounds vague, but it's because it could truly be anything you want). I loved working with my organization and I've learned a lot about what goes into an effective partnership and what it means to be both an intellectual AND a moral advocate for the communities that I wish to stand with and serve. My definition of care has been radically changed and I will continue to bring the principles this class has taught me throughout my career. HOWEVER, with all of that said, the actual class itself wasn't necessarily my favorite: the care journals/audio explorations felt more like busywork than anything else and the discussions about the readings were not the most effective (it felt like a select few students led the conversation and a lot of the time the conversation lacked direction, there was definitely a lot of awkward silence and blank stares at each other). Also, some of the things we did during class felt pointless. Everything was definitely done with good intentions and I see the value, but personally a lot of it did not resonate with me. Would still recommend this class though, just be aware it's a decent time commitment (not the class itself, but you will be volunteering at least 3–5 hours with your organization on top of taking this class and everything else in your semester)."

      "While ethics in data science is undoubtedly a very important topic that deserves recognition/acknowledgement and prioritization in CS and data science, I found this course a bit tedious. Firstly, the weekly assigned readings were very long, and I suggest either choosing shorter readings, assigning excerpts from these readings, or assigning fewer readings or less frequently.  More importantly, I feel like the topics covered in this course were very similar each day, and the discussions each day tended to lack direction and lead back to the same points. I would suggest discussing case studies (from the AI incident database for example) each day to ensure that each discussion is very different from day to day. While I appreciate that it is possible to take the class fully remotely/asynchronously by solely participating on Perusall and Ed, by the end of the semester, not many students regularly attended class, which could also be due to the class discussions being very similar and very unstructured each day. I also have a suggestion for improving assignments. I didn't like the \"coding\" assignments because (at least in my opinion) as CS and data science students, we're assigned many rigorous coding assignments throughout the semester, so it would be ideal if all the assignments for this class only involved writing. Overall, while I think the topics covered in this course are extremely important, I think the class discussions and assignments could be improved to be more productive."

      "While ethics in data science is undoubtedly a very important topic that deserves recognition/acknowledgement and prioritization in CS and data science, I found this course a bit tedious. Firstly, the weekly assigned readings were very long, and I suggest either choosing shorter readings, assigning excerpts from these readings, or assigning fewer readings or less frequently.  More importantly, I feel like the topics covered in this course were very similar each day, and the discussions each day tended to lack direction and lead back to the same points. I would suggest discussing case studies (from the AI incident database for example) each day to ensure that each discussion is very different from day to day.

      "This is literally the best STEM class I have taken in my time at Harvard as a junior in applied mathematics. Here are the reasons why:1) Ample study material. The course is accompanied by a very clear and well–written textbook that has been generated specifically for this course over Eli's many years of teaching APMTH 120. This is paired with a DropBox of coding examples for most of the topics you need to be able to replicate (which you should note as a useful resource for homework assignments). You will never need to scour for random resources or PDFs on the internet, as I have for so many previous classes. These materials tell you exactly what you need to know, with clear explanations or examples for each topic.2) Extremely fair quizzes and exams. You will be provided with a clear list of topics to master, as well as access to every past practice exam covering that same material. Eli doesn't believe in surprises on exams (though it would have been good to have a heads–up about the block power method this year...). The TFs are clear and responsive when you request help or need additional clarifications. If you decide to prepare in advance, you have every ability to do well.3) Highly applicable and relevant content. It was rare that we studied a topic that seemed unrelated to direct applications in data science. This is genuinely an applied class.4) Useful and achievable assignments. All the problem sets have clear instructions, as well as ample help available via office hours and Ed. They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head–banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure. The TFs under Eli are fantastic and responsive. There are a lot of windows for office hours, and they will take time out of their busy weeks to write clear responses to your stupid questions on Ed. They'll even do things like make supplementary materials or videos to explain trickier concepts. You'll never feel lost at sea.6) An awesome professor. Eli is a wonderful guy — I laughed out loud at least once per lecture — and he's the perfect person to teach this class.Don't get me wrong, the course is not necessarily *flexible* — there's a strict lateness policy, and the homework assignments come like clockwork every week, including spring break — but it's consistent, realistic, and the course staff will provide all the support in the world for you. I'm a burned out junior in AM who doesn't really feel like taking mind–numbing and/or poorly organized upper–level technical classes anymore, slogging through random proofs, learning about abstract concepts I don't care about, or spending hours debugging in whatever awful programming language my professor happens to like. Most classes I've taken at Harvard involve at least one of these attributes, typically several, but this class had none of that. It was clear, helpful, and the right degree of challenging, and I feel like the value I got out of the course scaled linearly with every hour of work I put in. I learned a lot of content in spite of myself. I'm really glad I took AM 120 and hope you take it too."

Melanie is a wonderful lecturer. If you take the class, Melanie's office hours are very helpful and an incredible resource that you should take advantage of. The course has a little bit of a different, more mathematical flavor than your average machine learning course at Harvard (which can be a good/bad thing depending on your interests), but I really enjoyed seeing machine learning presented from this angle and learning about geometric techniques. If you are interested in the material, you should take the course! The course is accessible to undergrads with good linear algebra knowledge and CS 181 level understanding of ML and coding. I would say the listed prerequisites are accurate and you'll get a lot out of the course if you're coming in with that background. There are a lot of undergrads taking the course, so if you're looking for a first graduate course, this is a great class with a great professor and interesting material that should be accessible to you if you have the prerequisite background."

Think about topics for your final project early, since time flies and there is much liberty in what you do, but you need to set your own benchmarks and progress check–ins, since that is all left up to the student. Study really hard in the beginning leading up to the midterm, because the class calms down immensely in the second half, but you'll need everything from the first half to do well on the midterm, and probably will use some of that in your final project. The class is very well structured, and there is ample support for deliverables. Just make sure you're on top of content, because everything will be tested in some way (psets, midterm, final project)."

      "This class is great if you're really motivated to learn about control, and it's perfect for anybody doing research in control. However, this is a MATH class. The problem sets are all formal proofs (no coding), and the second half of the semester is reading papers in control theory (not control applications). You can do an implementation project at the end of the course, but for anyone really interested in engineering solutions for control, you might be better off in a different class.For coursework, the class is split into two parts. For the first half of the semester, there is a PSet due every two weeks. Read the book religiously–––the lectures were copied straight from the book, and it was extremely helpful for problem sets. The problems aren't too bad if you give yourself enough time. Once problem sets stop and reading reflections begin, expect to spend a lot of time reading papers on linear control theory bounds and scratching your head wondering how useful the stuff really is. I thought it got better at the very end when we started looking at MPC and RL, and that stuff is really useful!"

      "Absolute gem for premeds looking to fulfill their physics req that are also trying to keep up/boost their gpa. I took PS2 in the fall and really enjoyed working with the course staff, but was really concerned about my gpa while juggling a thesis. This class was a godsend. Yes, there is a lot of weekly work that you have to keep up with, but I'd take it any day over trying to study for an exam a few days before a thesis deadline (your priorities might be very different if you arent thesising). It's important to note that (in my opinion) the content doesn't prepare you as well for the mcat the way that ps2/ps3 does, but if you're already studying for the exam then you kind of already learn the specific content that you need to know (i know a few people that took the mcat before enrolling in AP50B that just taught themselves that material from practice books). So, if mcat prep is your concern, i wouldn't be too worried.I was confused about the workload for this class going into it, so I'll explain below for anyone also confused or trying to balance out an already difficult courseload.Assignments:This class is almost entirely based on effort rather than correctness (but they know if you completely BS assignments or don't put any time into them, so don't do that). If you just put in 1–3 hours for each big weekly assignment (readings/learning catalytics = 1 chapter per week and ~12 multiple choice questions, desmos tutorial = 30 shorter questions, challenge = 3 long multi–step questions), and spread it across several days, then it's super manageable and flexible to work with (cramming is also doable but just more exhausting lol). It's just like psetting but without the crying. I used to spend way too much time on assignments in the beginning of the semester, but once you get used to the flow of it and get a better feeling for student expectations, then it's much easier to work more efficiently. then, during one half of class (2x a week) you're expected to meet with your team and review your responses, discuss them with a TF, and then receive the answer key and submit corrections/a short reflection for each tutorial and challenge. If you're efficient with your time, these corrections can usually be entirely done during class. You also need to re–do your learning catalytics questions as a team after you do it individually, and have to make sure that you get at least 50% correct.Projects:the other half of class is spent on either project prep in the lab or \"skill session\" activities in which you learn skills specific to your project, e.g. arduino coding. your projects and skill sessions can usually be done entirely within the allotted class time, it's great. The projects are pretty relaxed since you have time to work on them during class, as long as everyone in your group pulls their weight, then it's a breeze. I got lucky with great groups (they're randomly assigned) but you can always communicate to the course staff if you're struggling. The final project was much shorter than the 2 semester projects, which meant that the class was done before reading period. Attendance:you have the option to complete your team homework reviews on zoom if some members are sick, but usually always have to be in person for the project/skill session stuff anyways so you basically need to attend every class, but the course staff are pretty understanding if you can't make it for some reason, so just keep in touch with them if you miss anything.Grading: You're required to submit pretty much all of the assignments in order to get an A in the class, but because you're not graded on correctness for the work you complete outside of class, this automatically saves you a lot of stress/time compared to freaking out about psets at office hours. Absolutely prioritize filling out all of the surveys for the class throughout the semester. If you complete 2 specific surveys in the beginning of the semester and then 2 again at the end, you get 6 extra credit points that can be used to boost individual assignment grades. You can use this boost once in each category (so you can use two points to boost a challenge and a tutorial, but not two challenges). You also need to use one of these points if you missed a deadline and want to submit an assignment for credit. grading is based on a 3–point system; 0=no credit, 1=needs improvement, 2=A+, 3=super A+ (you can use 3's to boost 1's, also just once per category). I would try to save these for the end of the semester for when the content gets harder. You also have the option to just submit a redo request for an assignment that you already submitted that got a 0 or 1, which does not use up any of your extra credit points or 3's. IMO this is the best option because if you retain all of your 6 extra credit points, you can boost your letter grade. This class gives you so many opportunities to improve your grade.overall, i could not be more thankful that this class exists, and it is a certified premed senior spring course in my book after years of exam courses. The scheduling of the course may change next year so this is all just based on my experience, but the overall structure will stay the same and, if anything, just changes to make things easier for students. Eric is such a wonderful human being, absolutely reach out to him and talk to him when you have a chance because he rocks. also the TFs and other staff in the course are so kind and helpful. good luck!"

      "Absolute gem for premeds looking to fulfill their physics req that are also trying to keep up/boost their gpa. I took PS2 in the fall and really enjoyed working with the course staff, but was really concerned about my gpa while juggling a thesis. This class was a godsend. Yes, there is a lot of weekly work that you have to keep up with, but I'd take it any day over trying to study for an exam a few days before a thesis deadline (your priorities might be very different if you arent thesising). It's important to note that (in my opinion) the content doesn't prepare you as well for the mcat the way that ps2/ps3 does, but if you're already studying for the exam then you kind of already learn the specific content that you need to know (i know a few people that took the mcat before enrolling in AP50B that just taught themselves that material from practice books). So, if mcat prep is your concern, i wouldn't be too worried.I was confused about the workload for this class going into it, so I'll explain below for anyone also confused or trying to balance out an already difficult courseload.Assignments:This class is almost entirely based on effort rather than correctness (but they know if you completely BS assignments or don't put any time into them, so don't do that). If you just put in 1–3 hours for each big weekly assignment (readings/learning catalytics = 1 chapter per week and ~12 multiple choice questions, desmos tutorial = 30 shorter questions, challenge = 3 long multi–step questions), and spread it across several days, then it's super manageable and flexible to work with (cramming is also doable but just more exhausting lol). It's just like psetting but without the crying. I used to spend way too much time on assignments in the beginning of the semester, but once you get used to the flow of it and get a better feeling for student expectations, then it's much easier to work more efficiently. then, during one half of class (2x a week) you're expected to meet with your team and review your responses, discuss them with a TF, and then receive the answer key and submit corrections/a short reflection for each tutorial and challenge. If you're efficient with your time, these corrections can usually be entirely done during class. You also need to re–do your learning catalytics questions as a team after you do it individually, and have to make sure that you get at least 50% correct.Projects:the other half of class is spent on either project prep in the lab or \"skill session\" activities in which you learn skills specific to your project, e.g. arduino coding. your projects and skill sessions can usually be done entirely within the allotted class time, it's great. The projects are pretty relaxed since you have time to work on them during class, as long as everyone in your group pulls their weight, then it's a breeze. I got lucky with great groups (they're randomly assigned) but you can always communicate to the course staff if you're struggling. The final project was much shorter than the 2 semester projects, which meant that the class was done before reading period. Attendance:you have the option to complete your team homework reviews on zoom if some members are sick, but usually always have to be in person for the project/skill session stuff anyways so you basically need to attend every class, but the course staff are pretty understanding if you can't make it for some reason, so just keep in touch with them if you miss anything.Grading: You're required to submit pretty much all of the assignments in order to get an A in the class, but because you're not graded on correctness for the work you complete outside of class, this automatically saves you a lot of stress/time compared to freaking out about psets at office hours. Absolutely prioritize filling out all of the surveys for the class throughout the semester. If you complete 2 specific surveys in the beginning of the semester and then 2 again at the end, you get 6 extra credit points that can be used to boost individual assignment grades. You can use this boost once in each category (so you can use two points to boost a challenge and a tutorial, but not two challenges). You also need to use one of these points if you missed a deadline and want to submit an assignment for credit. grading is based on a 3–point system; 0=no credit, 1=needs improvement, 2=A+, 3=super A+ (you can use 3's to boost 1's, also just once per category). I would try to save these for the end of the semester for when the content gets harder. You also have the option to just submit a redo request for an assignment that you already submitted that got a 0 or 1, which does not use up any of your extra credit points or 3's. IMO this is the best option because if you retain all of your 6 extra credit points, you can boost your letter grade. This class gives you so many opportunities to improve your grade.overall, i could not be more thankful that this class exists, and it is a certified premed senior spring course in my book after years of exam courses. The scheduling of the course may change next year so this is all just based on my experience, but the overall structure will stay the same and, if anything, just changes to make things easier for students. Eric is such a wonderful human being, absolutely reach out to him and talk to him when you have a chance because he rocks. also the TFs and other staff in the course are so kind and helpful. good luck!"

      "Subir is not the best lecturer in the world and doesnt explain a lot of things, but he is certainly very entertaining to watch in lecture. he has very strange quirks that you just cant help but pick up on in lecture. I really enjoyed taking this class with my fellow undergrads because subir was so memeable that this course became very fun even though the psets were not fun at all. the material was very important to know for condensed matter, but there is an implicit requiremnt that you already know quantum field theory before taking this class. Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things."

The teacher and TF are the sweetest people ever and have a genuine interest in what you draw as well as how you progress in the class.

      "This class is a must take for anyone who has a strong interest in making creative work that is meaningful and makes you feel things. Patrice is the BEST instructor I have ever had at my time at Harvard, and I say that confidently as a senior whose taken small/big, stem/humanities, seminar/lecture classes. They have an incredibly strong pedagogical approach, and the class community is super tight–knit, a result of Patrice's careful class curation, structure, and warmth. I have learned so much from our professor in terms of technical and creative ability; not only do I feel really confident in capturing the right shot, but I feel like the content and style of my photography has developed so much too! It's rare that you get to learn from a teaching staff that is so knowledgeable, compassionate, and creative. And in this class, you will have a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity to go wild with your creative endeavors, truly develop as a person/photographer/creative agent, and become comfortable with the entire photographic process from ideation to editing to curation. If Patrice is still leading this class, take it! Harvard desperately needs faculty like them who are able to do the tough work of growing you as a person across a million dimensions. Take this class if you are okay with slowing down to reflect, love snack time, and have the energy/capacity to dedicate a good chunk of your semester toward photography (hint: the key to good pics is time, not just the cool places you go). Take the class if want to take photos that are so much more than just iPhone/Instagram photography, want to get pushed outside of your comfort zone, and love specific feedback on both how you can take better photos technically and how to create photos that leave an impact. And definitely take this class even if you don't have prior camera experience (I came in with none), have never taken an AFVS class before (I didn't), or are worried that you aren't artsy enough (deeply personal/introspective/cultural work >>> avant–garde/modernist/inaccessible photos). This is THE class that will stick with me long after I graduate!!!"

Not only is shooting and editing on 16mm such a rare opportunity, the course itself is so foundational to the department that it's design will truly help you see filmmaking through a completely different lens. Working on a collaborative project like the final documentary allows you to build skillsets for collaborative work with the support of constant feedback that gives space for you to actively adjust and improve without impacting your own creative thought–process too much. Because of how small and intensive the class is, you'll also have an opportunity to build fabulous relationships that you'll carry with you into your filmmaking career. Highly highly recommend!"

If your a potential afvs concentrator and is more focused in film classes, this course is just as great in teaching you the basics with some of the softwares for post production, sound for making an original sound track, and other related parts like costumes for characters and scene by scene shot examination. I found myself loving the art in the end of this course and more importantly loving puppets (cow puppets). I think that course is very loving with your small nicely knitted family and I think that you could work with some of then most artistically inclined people that you've ever meet. I love the material that was passed from Micheal and Ruth as they always were teaching me something new in the world of animation that I wouldn't complete get before.I think that the film screenings are so fun. I love getting thoughts from others about certain films and inserting mine. I feel like healthy dialogue is encouraged in this course and I feel like when the other animation classes get merged in this discussion you hear so much more perspectives.As an aspiring film director/maker, I want to be able to master the story telling/narrative POV and I feel so much more complete now taking this course because I know what I must do to get there. I also got to learn how to value each shot, frame by frame, and how each frame contributes a greater meaning in the course. Please don't undermine this course. It is too valuable. It feels like a must for AFVS concentrators!"

They are hilarious and clever and I always looked forward to this class above all others. I always knew Patrice was genuinely looking out for me and cared about my success and happiness. They are so full of wisdom and insight and I could listen to them talk all day! They will help guide you in your photography with warmth and refreshing honesty, pushing you to reach your full potential and helping you follow your interests. Harvard would be a much better place if there were more professors like Patrice. I will say if you are considering taking this class specifically, you should actually read the syllabus and pay attention when Patrice describes the seminar content. It was very clear that some people did not know what they were getting into and had a bad attitude as a result. This was not just a photography studio and some people were upset when it wasn't what they expected which definitely took away from their ability to learn and appreciate the course."

Here's my advice...If you selected option (a) above: you know that this guy is special. He teaches you how to see the world, and how to develop your own lens for doing so. The readings are interesting and rewarding, if you choose to do them, and the assignments are a breath of fresh air. If reading through a year of a magazine sounds fun, this class is for YOU! 10 pages will feel like nothing, and you'll be surprised by how well you write when you get to choose your own topic. Professor Stilgoe, himself, is somebody to know and a bad man to cross. Go to his office hours, get to know him. All of the amazing stories you have heard are true.If you selected option (b) above: you are about to understand what Harvard is supposed to be like. I find it hard to process what's happening at this school and in general, I suck at debating politics. This class shows you how to filter out that noise and form your own opinions. The assignments are all manageable, and honestly help you heal from other classes' work. If you choose to attend office hours or coffee hour before lecture, you will find a mentor in Professor Stilgoe. Or, you could continue living your life and forget you ever read this. The choice is yours."

If you love love films or barely ever watch movies, this class is so great for you because either way it is going to challenge all the assumptions you have about film as a medium. It is impossible to come through this course without having a dramatically altered perspective on the potential of the film medium in art.

Second: the people in this class are selected for the interdisciplinary perspective they might offer to printmaking questions, and so you're guaranteed to emerge with at least one out–there, wacky angle on the print tradition and print futures that you might not ever be able to encounter outside the highly free, cross–disciplinary, encounter–based discussions we have. Third: the course is extremely time–consuming—you enact the practice of spending way too many hours in both the studio and in HAM, allowing you to understand the practical considerations of why most people just specialize in one discipline. The amount of time required to become at least functional in some of the printmaking techniques introduced in studio + the amount of time required to be able to identify those techniques and theorize about them in master prints will sum to a huge chunk of your week. The only point of improvement I would recommend for the course is that, especially at the end of semester, it felt more like an AFVS course than an HAA course, and lost some of its interdisciplinary charm. I wish we had had one more class section in which we took a birds–eye view on what the two fields could learn from each other, and whether printmaking is a good frontier for the two disciplines to begin taking first steps towards joining again: i.e. modern printmakers must know the tradition and the techniques of print.Moreover, you should take this course if you're looking for a truly open environment where you can be as experimental as you want to be, in theory and in practice, with the full support of two brilliant and extremely kind and supportive professors."

If you like working in small groups on worksheets instead of just sitting in a lecture, this is the course for you! I felt a lot more comfortable working in a smaller group to solve problems rather than just going into homeworks blind about what solving astrophysics problems entail. The midterm and final were barely like a test at all, the structure of them was essentially people come in to visit the course who have a wide range of backgrounds and in small groups you work to talk about the problems with them. As someone who always struggles on tests due to anxiety, I really enjoyed this method because it never felt like there was any negative outcomes. If you have trouble explaining a problem, another group member or even a CA/TF/Prof would help you out, which I really enjoyed since it felt more welcoming. The problems sets were a bit all over the place in terms of difficulty, but the CAs and TFs were super helpful in answering questions and helping out. I would recommend this course if you can commit to going to essentially every class and if you like learning, because this course is tailored to the learning and solving experience rather than tests."

      "This is the worst course that I've taken at Harvard. The flaws are numerous: 1. Should not be taught in IRAF. Modern astrophysics is done in python, leaving this course is very outdated.2. Course structure: it was always very unclear what tasks were required/graded, and most assignments were submitted through email...?3. Final project is very undirected. No assignment requirements or rubrics are provided, despite it almost entirely determining our grade.4. Final project support is minimal, but not at fault of the TFs. After completing data reduction, groups are left to do data analysis on their own (and all groups chose to do it in Python, as this is the modern coding language of astrophysics), but because each group is doing a different type of project, the TFs are not able to help very much. 5. After spring break, class time becomes equivalent to office hours, but attendance is still mandatory.6. Introductory lectures do not offer any educational value as they are, largely, covering material that is a prerequisite for the class.7. First half of the course is spent going through IRAF \"documents,\" which are outdated, riddled with typos and errors, and impossible to go through individually. They do not incentivize learning as they require dependence upon TFs – you get too bogged down in the outdated software to learn anything meaningful.8. I have not received any written feedback, in any form, for a single assignment this entire semester.The spring break trip to Arizona is pretty fun, especially if you have friends in the class. However, with the numerous glaring issues that this course presents, I do not think that it is anywhere near worth it.If you are considering taking this class to satisfy astro requirements, take any other course in the department before this one. If you are planning to take this class for some other reason, don't."

Try not to leave your psets until the day of, but if you're experienced enough with coding it should be doable within a reasonable amount of time. I and many people I know got through the psets fairly quickly, and they were all incredibly useful! The final project at the end is also great, you basically had free rein  to do whatever and we had a poster presentation at the end. The TFs Ana Sofia and Kaylee are also amazing! They've helped me debug late into the night or early in the morning way too often and I am forever grateful for them.

We were expected to read a full length (~10 pages) research paper on a tissue engineering topic before each class, which easily takes 2 hours. Also, you will be randomly assigned to present critiques of the paper during certain classes, but if you do the reading and come to class with a few points, you will be in good shape. There are also a few online lectures that you you have to watch for the midterm. Midterm is open–note and doable if you understand the lectures and review journal club papers. Lab is very time–consuming, especially the weeks after spring break where we design and run our own experiments. Expect to come into lab every 2–3 days if you split work with your group. Avery and Melissa are amazing and always ready to help, though! If you have any interest in tissue engineering, take this class (!!!) but know that you will have to put in the work."

      "make sure to work with your classmates, it makes life a lot easier on the assignments as they can be difficult. Show up to class, most of the written problems on psets can be solved directly using lecture notes. Otherwise, office hours with prof smith or whoever is CA are extremely helpful. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what a question is tasking you to do, so just coming back to it during OH saved me hours. This course is very doable and enjoyable, especially if you do not have many pset classes. Presentations at the end of class were not too stressful. Just spend time engaging with the research paper you are presenting and that is plenty of prep, Prof Smith isn't grading them harshly. They are mainly a means of learning more about the applications of course content. This is a good course to fulfill elective req, especially if you already took BE110."

The plus side: no exams! Overall, if you want to learn the best, most efficient techniques for causal inference and estimation with somewhat of a machine–learning focus, I would recommend taking this course. It will also make you much better at reading statistical literature, as the assigned readings are extremely high quality,and Nima takes great care in selecting papers that teach you a lot about the subject and also give you practice critiquing scholarly work."

      "If you are thinking about taking Chem17 vs Chem20, choose chem20. You will not regret it one bit. 1) Your grade will be ok/about the same in both classes. A lot of people (pre–meds) worry about their grade and think that Chem20 might give them a worse grade than Chem17. The reality is that most students in both classes end up with A/A–. Chem20 has harder exams/lower exam averages, but your final course grade is curved, so it turns out perfectly fine. 2) You get a deeper understanding of chemistry with Chem20. Chem20 takes the time to introduce MO theory immediately and goes into greater depth on why each reaction you learn happens. It begins to teach you chemical intuition so that you can look at a molecule and immediately have some idea of its reactivity. In short, the course teaches organic chemistry by logic and reasoning rather than sheer memorization. 3) The course materials are FAR superior to Chem17 or ANY course you've ever taken. I'm not kidding. The course is so organized that you get 2 booklets on day 1: a bound booklet of the lecture notes that you fill in during lectures and second, a book of practice questions for each module of material. The exams, problem sets, and practice questions are all similar, so definitely do the practice questions. There are so many practice questions that mimic the conceptual and the synthesis questions on the actual exams very well. 4) Lab is actually sort of fun. The head lab TF Dominic will hopefully still be there. Dominic and Co. make lab super chill but still informative. The course  is a bit weird in that lab doesn't seem to count a lot towards your final grade, but imo, this actually helps you focus on lab and really enjoy learning the techniques (whether you end up using them in your future career or not).5) You get so much support. The TFs, PSLs, and ofc Professor Liu are all so willing to explain concepts/exam problems to help you improve over time. Actually, the best part is that you are assigned Pset groups with other students. This means that, unlike many other classes where you may struggle to find people to work with, you start the class with a pset group. ALSO after every exam, there is a group exam where you get to get some points back on the exam by working in another assigned group. The group is randomly assigned and changes each exam. This means that you get to know pretty much everyone in the class.Tldr: Take the course. Grade will be fine. You learn SO MUCH. All assignments are designed to prepare you well for exams/teach you a lot. You make many friends. Keep in mind that as we write these reviews, we have no clue what our final grade will be (that's the case for all classes). I've had some cases where I write positive reviews for classes, get a bad final grade, and regret writing that review. I'm here to say that regardless of my final grade (which again will be fine), I would 100% recommend this class to everyone who has any slight interest in chemistry at all."

It's a very well organized course and what you need to do to do well in the course is very clear: attend lectures, go to section, do your PSETs (alone first!!!! and then go to OH if stuck/to check. This is super crucial, if you don't do the PSETs alone first, you might as well not do them, you will not benefit), review everything before the exams, take the practice exams, write down the things you got wrong/were confusing/you might forget and voila! There is SO SO much support and help, there are helprooms pretty much every single day ever, you will never feel stuck and unsupported. Honestly, a lot of people who do poorly in orgo just shoot themselves in the foot and then wonder what happened.. they don't pay attention in lecture, they show up and just talk to friends or don't show up at all (okay to do this once or twice but not frequently), they don't show up to section or they don't pay attention during it, they do the PSETs with friends, they never go to OH and they study for the exam the night before. If you do this, you WILL do poorly in the class. This is not the class to mess around. It is a hard course and you must put in the time and effort to do well, that is the hard part. If you put in the time and effort, there will be nothing in your way, everything will be super feasible."

It's a very well organized course and what you need to do to do well in the course is very clear: attend lectures, go to section, do your PSETs (alone first!!!! and then go to OH if stuck/to check. This is super crucial, if you don't do the PSETs alone first, you might as well not do them, you will not benefit), review everything before the exams, take the practice exams, write down the things you got wrong/were confusing/you might forget and voila! There is SO SO much support and help, there are helprooms pretty much every single day ever, you will never feel stuck and unsupported. Honestly, a lot of people who do poorly in orgo just shoot themselves in the foot and then wonder what happened.. they don't pay attention in lecture, they show up and just talk to friends or don't show up at all (okay to do this once or twice but not frequently), they don't show up to section or they don't pay attention during it, they do the PSETs with friends, they never go to OH and they study for the exam the night before. If you do this, you WILL do poorly in the class. This is not the class to mess around. It is a hard course and you must put in the time and effort to do well, that is the hard part. If you put in the time and effort, there will be nothing in your way, everything will be super feasible."

      "If you have to take this class, know that it is not as bad as people say. If you go to section and one office hours every week (e.g. I just went to Ted's every week), you will do fine. It is fairly easy to get an A if you keep up with the material and the midterm exams are fair, so I would not recommend taking it pass fail unless you're in your senior spring (note I took this along with 5 other classes – 6 total). That being said, the final was very hard, and if you fall behind for a week it will cascade and make it harder to catch up. However, Ted does a great job of recording review sessions and office hours on top of class, so it is okay to miss lectures if you have other commitments and watch the recordings. Ted also really cares about the class, and his dry sense of humor can be very funny (once it stops being scary). He puts a lot of time and effort into the class, and you can feel it as a student. He is also super accessible outside of class. He is of course super super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject as well. If you do not HAVE to take this class, I likely wouldn't recommend it. I walked away feeling like I learned very little about chemistry. It did not really give me any fundamental understanding on a molecular level nor did I learn how to predict reactions, etc. I don't even feel much more confident reading papers about inorganic chemistry. On the other hand, Chem 20/30 were super useful and I felt like I learned a lot of practical skills and gained way more understanding during both those semesters."

      "This is the best course I've ever taken at Harvard. Never before have I seen a course staff (Especially Heidi) who care so much about students. This semester we worked on molecular glue synthesis. I learned organic lab techniques (Biotage, HPLC, inert atmosphere, etc), but my bigger takeaways were with how synthesis research is done. We gave group meeting presentations, annotated spectra, and wrote supporting information for our compounds (like for a paper). The poster presentation at the end seemed daunting but each step was broken down and honestly was not too stressful because of the support the staff gave. You also have a Lab Partner to split most assignments with!!The science advocacy component of this class was cool and definitely do the DC trip if you sign up! Talking to staffers and congressmen/senators was a cool experience.I loved the community the class produces. The 10 students this semester really forged strong friendships in this class and this was a powerful experience.Advice: do as much of the work/assignments in class so you can ask any questions if you are unsure or get stuck. You can leave the lab early and go home, but I usually stayed till the end to finish the assignments and basically not have research work outside of class. Workload is very fair for this class.Side Note: Chem 135 (experimental synthetic organic chemistry) is taught alongside Chem 100r. Chem 135 is a smaller and faster–paced course with more advanced labs, but does not have the science advocacy component (this may change) and also at least in this iteration of the course was less project–based. Students in Chem 135 tend to have more organic research experience, though it is not necessary by any means and the TFs will help you if you don't in either class!"

      "Lecture material was kind of confusing at times but reviewing during section and office hours was helpful. We spent a lot of time on derivations which I guess is nice if you're super interested into the why and how of certain formulas that we learn, but I wasn't. That wasn't on the exams though so I appreciated that but some psets used info from the derivations so we definitely didn't learn them for nothing so if you're interested in derivations there's that. The TFs were great at letting us know what the key concepts were to review while studying for exams which was useful because we cover a lot. There's no final in this course which was much appreciated, just two exams (a midterm and a 'final' that was only on the 2nd half of the course on the last day of class). The practice tests were so so so useful in preparing and the grading, at least for this past year, was generous which was nice given the difficulty of the exams. The problem sets were sometimes very difficult but having a good pset group and going to office hours should put you in a good place to do well. I personally wasn't super interested in statistical thermodynamics (and this course didn't change that) but it taught me what I'm supposed to know and I didn't suffer that much which is all I was really hoping for. There are actually a lot of chemical applications which was helpful to contextualize all of the math and stats. Overall this was actually one of the better classes of my semester and I'd definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill the physical chemistry requirement. Prof Zhuang was a great professor (and actually being IN the lecture hall for lecture will do you a world of good in terms of understanding the material, forming a pset group, and just generally increasing good faith between yourself and the teaching staff/Prof Zhuang) and Carl and Vaibhav were great TFs. I didn't have a strong math background (only took 21a/equivalent my freshman fall and took this course my junior spring) so I got frustrated at times but the TFs were really nice in explaining some math concepts at office hours and otherwise I was fine so don't be too worried if you don't have a stats/math background."

      "CHEM 166 was a new course offered in Spring 2024 taught by Professor Suyang Xu. As a whole, CHEM 166 was definitely an interesting introduction to various aspects of quantum chemistry and physics, especially as it relates to topics like superconductors, topological insulators, magnets, and more. Professor Xu is a very talented instructor that has a clear passion for the field, and is also generous enough to provide Papa John’s pizza once/week for students! (a clear highlight throughout the semester)Within the CHEM department, CHEM 166 is definitely a relatively gemmy course when it comes to workload and time commitment. Outside of the twice/week lectures and once/week section (which only starts after spring break), there are no Problem Sets or Exams. Instead, the class is structured around a group project where groups of 3–4 present on primary literature related one of the topics taught about in class, and subsequently turn in a two–page paper reflecting on said topic. Following this, instead of a Final Exam, the class has instead opted for a Final Project, which is a simple one–page paper using DFT to calculate the band structure of a material. Overall, it is obvious that the focus of the class lies in learning about the content and truly enjoying the material. In my opinion, the only downside is that the concepts can occasionally be harder to digest for students without as strong of a background in chemistry and/or physics, as a lot of lectures relate back to deriving formulas and theories. Overall, the only downside to this course relates back to the fact that no grades are provided for the group presentation, and that the group paper and final project are not due until the end of exam period. As a result, it is hard to gauge where you stand in the class, especially when it comes to deciding final letter grades since there are no assigned cutoffs. However, CHEM 166 remains an outstanding course overall.As a whole, CHEM 166 is definitely a great class and is one worth time and consideration for any aspiring CHEM concentrators!"

The TF was great and the professor is incredibly intelligent, however, that sometimes works against him. He dumbs down the topic to make it easier to understand but it is still incredibly difficult to understand and incredibly nuanced. If you do not have a theory background this class will not be a walk in the park and will involve doing some extra reading in your free time. Things get quite hectic at the end of the year I felt like I had 2 psets a midterm and a project to complete all within the same week, but the rest of the semester is less bad. However, I took so much out of this class and learned so much about theoretical chemistry. Anyone interested in a theoretical phD or grad school should definitely take this class and people who are interested in knowing more about the methods by which they conduct their chemical calculations should as well. Don’t be too intimidated by the math on the board as the professor intends for students to gain a conceptual understanding as evident by the exams. But, the psets did involve some deep dives into calculations. All in all, it was quite fairly well graded."

If you fall into the category of those who find Classics often feels overly dry and stymied, this class will definitely shatter those illusions. In the final third of the semester, the course turns to a more reception–based angle, looking at modern writers whose work chimes with Lucian's in some way (politically, stylistically, etc.) and thinking about how those writers might be used theoretically to read Lucian. All in, if you want to read around in a lesser–known but really interesting Greek writer, and to sharpen your approach to classical and postclassical literature more broadly, then this will be an excellent course to take."

Further, Professor Coleman made each lecture exciting and engaging. Her passion for the material shone and easily maintained my engagement throughout lecture. Both Professor Coleman and Alex's clear communication outside of class ensured that I never fretted over assignments. Further, I greatly enjoyed visiting the Harvard Art Museums as a class.

As a language class it was phenomenal too –– we always had different styles of lessons that would always keep us engaged. Prof. Dourou went above and beyond, often bringing in her children's toys to make it possible for us to learn the language in the most memorable, fun ways possible. Amongst the fun lesson plans, there were also lesson plans that were effective and actually felt like they helped build a community in the class. When we read stories from the Greek textbook, we actually got very invested in the characters of the story, and some students would often be the reader/speaker for the same characters. We watched a lot of Greek ads, and the ads were very memorable often having a storyline as well. To make the ads an even better lesson plan, we would have competitions on who can spot out the relevant words in the ad first. Absolutely amazing class. Truly no class, and no professor compares to prof. Dourou."

The professor is a brilliant and knowledgeable literary scholar, an incredible resource, and an eloquent educator. I was constantly learning new words in her class. It was inspiring to realize the continuities across regions and to learn about our oft–forgotten history. For example, themes of grief, loss of nation, class distinction, gender roles, etc.. were truly inspiring to me as a literary scholar. It's a true survey class, so the expectations are not too high while the support is generous from the professor. You will learn so so much, and I really enjoyed the work I produced in the class. It was great that we had a diversity of classmates as well, although I must say the most profound observations were made from the professor herself. It's not a must–take class by any means, but a very strong one to add to your schedule, especially if you have a passion for literature and SEA as I do."

Class discussions were always interesting and everyone seemed very engaged with the material. However, I think that one major area for improvement would be handing back feedback in a timely manner.

      "I took this class because I have a lot of respect for this teaching team, having taken a class with Greg and the head TF, Arin, before, and for my secondary.  Take this class if you want the experience of learning from someone who has spent his entire life mastering his craft, is extremely passionate about what he is talking about, and if you want to be exposed to new things in a super chill environment with people who just want to let you explore your interests. However, you will get out of this class what you put into it, so although it might seem tempting to let the chaos of other classes drive, don't short change yourself by ignoring this one. For those who require any kind of accommodations, the head TF, Arin, couldn't be any more on top of things, and will make sure she has you covered. The course has only one assignment throughout the semester, a final project that you can work up to throughout the semester. There are almost no required readings, but a lot of fun recommended ones from Greg. The weekly meetings consist of a lot of Greg sharing his interests, sharing different film clips and operas from all kinds of languages, and working to build in student presentations as the semester continues, and you begin to develop your ideas. He also loves to hold open houses throughout the week, where you can go talk about your final projects, and get wisdom from him and the teaching staff. these are lots of fun, and usually lead you down various side quests that can be super interesting to explore. Greg genuinely just loves to learn, connect with his students, and allow them to explore their own interests, and because of this, if you choose to engage with him and buy into the course, this is a super easy, rewarding, and low time commitment course that you should take."

Prof Zaritt was great at leading the course, answering questions, and keeping discussions productive. Course staff were very flexible with stuff in general which is great. Don't take this course thinking you'll be laughing the whole time, though. You spend the majority of class breaking down how humor and jokes work, so you're basically ruining the humor of it.

However, especially since this was the first time the course was offered, it was a bit difficult to follow along with how each topic relates to each other, and sometimes the work can feel a bit like busywork.

The course really tries to help students manage stress while doing CS during a busy semester. All the PSETs come with a week of extension time in case you need it. As long as you are not abusing the system (like you actually needed time to figure everything out as a beginner), you'll be fine! The PSETs also offer a safe space for learning because four of the five PSETs don't expect you to be perfect to get a good score. Instead, they just want to see serious effort, logical thinking, and decent usage of knowledge from class. If you put in serious effort, the final code and grade will honestly take care of themselves. The small quizzes throughout the semester are also low stakes (four to five points each) and their main purpose is to act as checkpoints for your understanding. They are meant to be straightforward and beneficial than anything else, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. Ask questions if you find yourself confused at any point. There will be a mix of emotions ranging from determination to frustration to ecstasy, but at the end of the roller coaster, you will walk away feeling proud and satisfied of how much you grew and were able to accomplish. Definitely spread your time out in completing the PSETs because scrambling to finish the code all at once isn't going to cut it. Besides, you will get so much more out of the class if your understanding/epiphany moments are gradual. Definitely go to office hours. Everyone in the staff team is so helpful and kind.

They are meant to be straightforward and beneficial than anything else, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. Ask questions if you find yourself confused at any point. There will be a mix of emotions ranging from determination to frustration to ecstasy, but at the end of the roller coaster, you will walk away feeling proud and satisfied of how much you grew and were able to accomplish. Definitely spread your time out in completing the PSETs because scrambling to finish the code all at once isn't going to cut it. Besides, you will get so much more out of the class if your understanding/epiphany moments are gradual. Definitely go to office hours. Everyone in the staff team is so helpful and kind. And make some friends in CS32! They will make your experience that much better and the memories I got from this course are ones that I love looking back on."

      "Some things to note from someone who took this class straight after CS50.The syntax for this language is likely nothing you have seen before, assuming you have no prior CS knowledge other than CS50. For the first few weeks, you will struggle with memorizing that syntax. Once you do learn it, (and this will probably be sometime after you turn in your first or second PSET) you will get used to it. So don’t be discouraged if you struggle with the language for the first week or so. If you wish to know, OCaml is a language that mostly relies on pattern matching (you can think of switch cases in python) and recursion. It’s pretty cool but nonetheless niche language.You will be assigned to have to do 2 in–person labs every week, flipped classroom style. You will be partnered up and you will go on your computers and try and solve the lab together (it’s just a series of OCaml problems and functions you have to set up). Good way to meet friends. The rotation for the labs was not very random, so I ended up sitting at the same table with my friends very frequently. These labs are not graded in class. Instead, after you take the class, you will be given the answers to the lab which you can review. Just make sure to turn in your corrected labs by Sunday night, as they grade for correctness only.PSETs can take a long time. Odd–numbered PSETs usually take the longest. Beware of PSET 3 and PSET 6. Take advantage of your late days. You get 8 in total, but 2 max per PSET. You’ll have a PSET a week usually,  and they’ll be due on Wednesday so make sure you’re on top of that. Do not leave it for the last day. Attend office hours and get there early. There was one time I waited for 4 hours after joining the queue and only then was I attended to.Some course material will probably leave you very confused. Semantics for programming languages will make up the majority of the final project, in which you implement a subset of OCaml within OCaml, but this will also be the hardest thing for you to learn.Exams are open book, open note and open laptop. Just no internet access. I can’t say much here except just study. I frequently bombed these exams, but the means are around low 80s to high 70s range.You’ll have readings due before every lab and a very short response to the readings due at the same time. Just watch the videos, instead. It’s a lot easier to digest than the readings and it takes a fraction of the time.You will become a better programmer after taking this course. You will likely never use the language again (unless you go to Jane Street), but the ideas you gather will stick with you. This class will make sure you look out for “Style” points in your PSET, which trains you to do the same in real life situations. Abstraction really is its own reward in this class, and you will probably pick up some neat design tips while taking it. tl;dr Take the class if you’re interested in becoming a better programmer. You’ll have a lot of work on your hands but it will be worth it."

      "If you are considering this course as a freshman and are mentally prepared for the challenge (and imposter syndrome lol), I say go for it. I took 124 as a freshman with the following preparation, and I was able to do pretty well in the course with a cracked pset group, begging for answers at office hours, regular section attendance, and a lot of grinding:High school math up to multi and linear but they were not rigorous at allSome small coding projects in high schoolMath 22a with Cliff TaubesCS50Self–studied discrete math over winter break based on the CS121 websiteNO competition math or competitive programming in high schoolNO CS120 or Stat110I don't think the amount of preparation you have coming into the class is super important as long as you are comfortable with math proofs, know discrete math (more or less), and know how to code. The biggest challenge in this course is how quickly you can process new information and how much time you can spend on the course –– it is very fast–paced, so you will have a lot of very difficult information thrown at you in a very short period of time. If you are able to either learn quickly or put in the effort to understand each of the topics, not taking Stat110 or CS120 will not cause you to fail this course.My advice for future students taking this class:KEEP UP WITH SECTION EVERY WEEK! This is super super important. Sections help you understand the algorithms conceptually, understand what the process of running them looks like, and learn relevant information for the week's pset. There have been countless times when I was completely lost after a lecture and then everything clicked when I went to section. The 124 TFs are really good teachers. Take advantage of that. Find a section that works well with your learning style and stick with it. If you absolutely have to miss a week, make sure you watch the section recording.GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are invaluable in this course. Make sure you go to them to ask questions about the pset and inevitably to beg for the answers.MAKE SURE YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND YOUR PSET ANSWERS. In my opinion, it's okay to work with a super cracked pset group and leech off of them/office hours for some pset answers. But it is SUPER important that you understand the solution and why it works. The psets are designed the way they are for a reason. They teach important conceptual topics/problem–solving strategies. The intuition behind them is very helpful for a general understanding of topics, and variations of pset problems may come up in exams. (One of the finals questions this year was pretty much just a reduction to an algorithm we had to give in a previous pset).MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FALL BEHIND. It is very easy to fall behind in this course, and it's very hard to catch back up when you do. If you are confused about a topic after that week's section, make sure to ask questions about it or figure it out as you work through the corresponding pset problem. I think understanding an algorithm conceptually is the most important thing, because once that makes sense, everything else will (more or less) fall into place after a lot more thinking. This will also help with problem solving on exam problems.CHECK AND USE ED. Ed is the platform we use to ask questions about lectures and psets. If you have a question, don't be afraid to use Ed. Either someone else already asked that same question or a TF or Prof will give you a very good answer. Also check what people ask about pset problems it can give you hints lol.Also we had a very good late–day policy this semester, so make sure you're utilizing those to keep yourself sane but also budgeting them so you still have enough by the end of the semester when all of your classes are hella busy.You will likely be pulling all–nighters to finish psets and you will likely feel a lot of imposter syndrome. I felt the same, but I feel like taking this class was 100% worth it. It's a grind, but the concepts you learn are so cool and important, and you will look back and realize how much more knowledge you've gained through just one class. You belong in this class. Good luck!"

      "If you are considering this course as a freshman and are mentally prepared for the challenge (and imposter syndrome lol), I say go for it. I took 124 as a freshman with the following preparation, and I was able to do pretty well in the course with a cracked pset group, begging for answers at office hours, regular section attendance, and a lot of grinding:High school math up to multi and linear but they were not rigorous at allSome small coding projects in high schoolMath 22a with Cliff TaubesCS50Self–studied discrete math over winter break based on the CS121 websiteNO competition math or competitive programming in high schoolNO CS120 or Stat110I don't think the amount of preparation you have coming into the class is super important as long as you are comfortable with math proofs, know discrete math (more or less), and know how to code. The biggest challenge in this course is how quickly you can process new information and how much time you can spend on the course –– it is very fast–paced, so you will have a lot of very difficult information thrown at you in a very short period of time. If you are able to either learn quickly or put in the effort to understand each of the topics, not taking Stat110 or CS120 will not cause you to fail this course.My advice for future students taking this class:KEEP UP WITH SECTION EVERY WEEK! This is super super important. Sections help you understand the algorithms conceptually, understand what the process of running them looks like, and learn relevant information for the week's pset. There have been countless times when I was completely lost after a lecture and then everything clicked when I went to section. The 124 TFs are really good teachers. Take advantage of that. Find a section that works well with your learning style and stick with it. If you absolutely have to miss a week, make sure you watch the section recording.GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are invaluable in this course. Make sure you go to them to ask questions about the pset and inevitably to beg for the answers.MAKE SURE YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND YOUR PSET ANSWERS. In my opinion, it's okay to work with a super cracked pset group and leech off of them/office hours for some pset answers. But it is SUPER important that you understand the solution and why it works. The psets are designed the way they are for a reason. They teach important conceptual topics/problem–solving strategies. The intuition behind them is very helpful for a general understanding of topics, and variations of pset problems may come up in exams. (One of the finals questions this year was pretty much just a reduction to an algorithm we had to give in a previous pset).MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FALL BEHIND. It is very easy to fall behind in this course, and it's very hard to catch back up when you do.

      "It's a fairly new course, but they did a pretty good job this year. Lectures: Lectures are good. Professor Chen is a great instructor. Assignments: There's like 6 homeworks. Honestly, all of them were pretty easy with the exception of the last one (that was due during finals period), so start that one early Exams: Exams are not too hard, but you should take the time to study for them (I wet the bed on the second due to inadequate preparation). There's not a lot of practice problems, so make sure you have a strong conceptual understanding of the material (i.e. understand what's being taught in lecture and the readings on a deep level). Would recommend the course. It'll probably get better and have a few tweaks next year, but wasn't bad at all. Honestly one of the most informative courses I've had at Harvard. Convex opt is a really cool and useful field in mathematics!"

      "This course is so much fun and incredibly engaging IF you are interested in computer system design, and you do not have extensive experience with computer hardware yet. It is definitely an introductory–level class, but it covers a lot of material from the transistor–level all the way into the processor and cache architecture. Vijay is awesome and so enthusiastic about the material; he also bakes spectacular brownies. The course support is very helpful too and consistently available in lectures and on Ed. A legendary past TF named Dhilan recorded useful, engaging section videos. And I've heard the textbook is useful...Some notes: First, this class does have a lot of moving parts, between lectures, section videos, problem sets, labs, and a midterm exam. The problem sets are all fairly short and very manageable. The team labs will take up the majority of your time in this class. The main advice I have: like in life, find a good partner, and get carried. These labs expect some familiarity with virtual environments and Git; they use a finicky coding language called SystemVerilog to implement hardware in a coding environment. Students are also given FPGA boards to program and test, which is quite neat. The labs are typically completed over multiple weeks, and especially at the start, involve a lot of setup and troubleshooting without extensive instruction. These labs will be fun if you enjoy the material; otherwise, they could be a source of great sadness."

      "Overall: CS 148/248 is a VLSI design course centered on building a full tape–out of a CMOS camera chip, covering all its components including digital logic, pixel arrays, SRAM memory, pad rings, and wire bonds. A great follow–on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred–slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one’s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year–to–year): MOSFET circuits, RC–timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout–level inverter/nand/nor/half–adder/full–adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically–generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega–OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch–up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in. Additionally, the distinction in expectations need to be made more clear between 148/248."

      "I think most people would say that this year's iteration of CS161 was perhaps not as difficult as folklore would have you think – I certainly suffered more in CS124 than in 161, although I suppose 124 has the safety net of somebody, somewhere will have the key insight or just the outright solution to a PSET, whereas in these sorts of classes, chatting to someone who has done the whole problem set might help you avoid some pitfalls, but you still have to put in the time to write the thing. I guess I should caveat that I took 165 the previous semester, and my experience there I think probably saved me a perhaps 1–3 hours on average per PSET, just from having some familiarity with GDB and instantly writing a good logging system (something I did way too late into 165, here it was the first thing I wrote and that was certainly a good decision).Eddie as always is a wonderful professor; he generally makes you think he has some boundless knowledge vault locked away in his head regarding everything related to systems. And we don't even need to talk about anything that follows `emacs –nw`. Anyone who writes such fabled characters in 2024 should probably either be worshipped or feared.Getting to build a reasonable sized portion of an operating system is awesome, the PSETs are obviously time consuming but honestly not even close to as overwhelming as I was expecting. I took this partly to build some familiarity with C++, and I definitely felt like I gained some of that, along with some good practice in GDB if either of those appeal to you.Overall, very much enjoyed, maybe a bit burnt out taking this and some other moderately time–consuming stuff in senior spring, but I'm not sure there's a better final assignment to hand in as a CS concentrator as your operating system final project (even if mine was pretty meh) and be able to call yourself done with Harvard :)"

Not needing to do a final exam makes up for most of this, and the grading itself is generally kind as well. Shlomo is amazing, the TFs are helpful, just make sure you ask for the solution code at the beginning of every pset (since they build off of each other), and go in with a helpful partner or do it on your own."

Although I had taken all the prereqs (and was taking stat 111 simultaneously), I started the class being very very confused. The class has notation that does not correspond to the notation used in stat 110/111 in very important cases. For example, they write N(x; mu, sigma2) to mean the pdf of the normal. The multivariate normal distribution (among other vector valued distributions) are just used without really an explanation of how they work. Note that none of the prerequisities teach multivariate distribution PDF  (stat 110 covers it with relation to its property that any linear combo of the entries will be normally distributed, not its actual pdf). You are just supposed to figure out the notation for the PDFs of these distributions. Have you ever had to write out the multivariate normal pdf? I certainly hadn’t, let alone understand the covariance matrix multiplication done in the pdf. You should be VERY familiar with Likelihood functions and likelihood maximization as a concept. This class is all about expressing the state/model/action we want in terms of some some loss/reward and then minimizing/maximizing it with respect to the variables we want to optimize. You WILL have to write likelihoods that involve many many sums and products over variables. Get used to it by practicing to write the likelihood functions for various distributions, joint distributions etc. You should be very familiar with converting your likelihood function to a log likelihood one. Familiarize yourself with the use of indicators in likelihoods to write likelihoods neatly instead of writing in terms of cases.  I HEAVILY recommend looking into derivative identities as it relates to matrices. How do you take the derivative w.r.t to a vectors or a matrix? how do you take derivatives of complex looking matrix multiplications such as v^{T}Av with respect to scalars, vectors etc. LOOK UP THE MATRIX COOKBOOK. memorize/understand how those derivatives work, at least have it saved in an easily accessible location. Put these in your cheatsheet too if possible. Finale and David are both fine lecturers, though I liked Finale better. Their lectures were not the worst (like hesterberg) but not the best (like Mickens). Not the most engaging for me. Its was the classic let’s just jump into it mentality where the teacher speaks for 60 minutes and attempts to transmit info to students. However, one must realize that an occasional joke or deliberately done diversion would go a long way towards keeping the lectures engaging. Please see James Mickens and ask for his wisdom in teaching.  One big feedback I want to give David is to preferably never say “After some SIMPLE computation, we get …” or its many variants. It’s one of the most demoralizing things to hear from lecturers. If the computation is elided for some x reason (such as too time consuming), say so. Say that it is in the book, so you won’t cover it here. However, saying that the topic is easy or simple doesn’t help anyone. Also, they should spend more time rehearsing their lectures and stop with the many erms, and umms. I find it extremely paternalistic to make attendance in lecture required. I do understand that the teacher teaching the lecture would feel that lectures are important. But why not let the students decide? Surely we are adults and we can make decisions according to our own situations. (Note that for Harvard students, the grade they get is pretty important, so they will usually do anything they feel is necessary to do well in a class).  For example, I lived in the quad and am not a good sleeper. Making it to my 9.45 am class is excruciating since I need more sleep than the average undergraduate here. Even in ideal conditions, i need to have at least 10 hours to function properly. Note that many assignments for classes are due at 11:59pm and so I can usually only sleep after that (among other reasons). Moreover, I am extremely skilled at listening to audio and watching stuff in high speeds (i.e 2.5–3.5x speeds) so it is mentally torturous for me to listen to people in real life speeds. Moreover, its impossible for me to take notes during lectures because the moment I focus on the notes, I miss the words said by the lecturers. Please please reconsider your attendance policy and have it be optional with perhaps a grade boost for attendance. I personally will literally forgo some attendance points to not attend lecture. I feel that strongly about my abilities as a student and in my conviction about lectures being bad. The two lectuers are not that good anyways, so why make lectures mandatory? What does attendance achieve that 2.5x panopto with me frequently stopping the video and taking notes doesn't achieve.  There will be conceptual understanding questions in the end of every lecture which are a great way to make sure you understand what was covered. A highlight of the class with very thought–provoking questions. If you end up watching the lectures, please acknowledge their value and actually do the conceptual questions before watching ahaid .   The psets are good. Each one makes you derive some results similarto those done in lecture and section. The coding portion of psets are VERY enjoyable, though that might be because I love coding myself :D You should familiarize yourself with numpy immediately and learn as many vectorized operations as possible. In the psets, you’ll have to write code that runs  for many iterations, so vectorizing is very important for getting reasonable runtimes. Sections were pretty meh. I tried a couple sections and it felt like the TFs were improvising rather having prepared for them. You know, these peers of mine are supposed to be the biggest advocates for the class and bring some energy into their section! Moreover, the sections felt extremely rushed since there were many topics to cover and the TFs were supposed to cover so much in so little time. Since it was impossible for the TFs to cover everything in the notes, perhaps more instructions on what was important would have been nice. For the rest of the material, perhaps they could have been shared separately. 181 is sort of a prestige class as in the class covers a topic that is very popular these days and thus gets a lot of students to take it. It is also hard enough to warrant consideration of what else you’re taking (See time spent above and estimate something similar for yourself). Again, comparison is the thief of joy and similar to my 124 review, there will be MANY people who are better than you. So come prepared for annoying student asking annoying questions. Also, for those of you who already know the stuff, you should know better than to be a smug p.o.s. Also, I went into the class expecting a lot of neural networks, but the class is more focused on different methods rather than exploring a given method/model well. So, come expecting that. Midterm 1 was extremely hard with the median being somewhere around 40. The second midterm was generally easier for everyone. Don’t be like me and definitely study more for the midterms, especially for the first. A score that is significantly above the median might make the class an almost guaranteed A range. The class doesn’t have many practice questions for midterms which makes the prep work for the midterms way harder. reading the textbook/ watching lectures is not an alternative to actual practice questions. I call upon the lecturers to create more if possible. The class does not release the exams afterwards and according to a TF, this is because “there is a limited number of questions that can be asked”. This is garbage. For two renowned professors, creating a new exam with similar material should be a piece of cake! Are the professors just planning, for example, to recycle a likelihood calculation question directly and replace the distribution to something else? I expected better. Meanwhile Stat 111 provides 5 years of finals and midterms. Stat 110 gives you almost 10 exams. The textbook, is a really good resource and I think should take precedence over the lectures for your studies. Some graduating senior wrote a better resource than the professors lol. The textbook has so much more detail and better explanations than the lectures. Make use of the textbook if at all possible. Use Speechify if you find reading hard like me. Overall, the class is probably a class with the most potential to be awesome but falls short. I am sad that I don’t go to MIT/ can’t take those classes for concentration credit. You know why they don’t allow concentration credit from MIT? Because I think they know that no one in their right mind would do the harvard version with inferior resources, inferior lecturers, and inferior department. The AI/ML faculty here really needs to step up their game. Make 181 better and revive 182 better than it once was. Know that the current situation is NOT preparing us for the upcoming future well. Also, trying to cover both supervised and unsupervised learning in one class leaves both topics shallowly taught. Consider a year–long course. You know what, I'm just going to say perhaps consider taking the MIT version of the class (especially if not a concentrator). Maybe its a grass is always greener on the other side situation, but this side certainly isn't a vibrant green. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

Although I had taken all the prereqs (and was taking stat 111 simultaneously), I started the class being very very confused. The class has notation that does not correspond to the notation used in stat 110/111 in very important cases. For example, they write N(x; mu, sigma2) to mean the pdf of the normal. The multivariate normal distribution (among other vector valued distributions) are just used without really an explanation of how they work. Note that none of the prerequisities teach multivariate distribution PDF  (stat 110 covers it with relation to its property that any linear combo of the entries will be normally distributed, not its actual pdf). You are just supposed to figure out the notation for the PDFs of these distributions. Have you ever had to write out the multivariate normal pdf? I certainly hadn’t, let alone understand the covariance matrix multiplication done in the pdf. You should be VERY familiar with Likelihood functions and likelihood maximization as a concept. This class is all about expressing the state/model/action we want in terms of some some loss/reward and then minimizing/maximizing it with respect to the variables we want to optimize. You WILL have to write likelihoods that involve many many sums and products over variables. Get used to it by practicing to write the likelihood functions for various distributions, joint distributions etc. You should be very familiar with converting your likelihood function to a log likelihood one. Familiarize yourself with the use of indicators in likelihoods to write likelihoods neatly instead of writing in terms of cases.  I HEAVILY recommend looking into derivative identities as it relates to matrices. How do you take the derivative w.r.t to a vectors or a matrix? how do you take derivatives of complex looking matrix multiplications such as v^{T}Av with respect to scalars, vectors etc. LOOK UP THE MATRIX COOKBOOK. memorize/understand how those derivatives work, at least have it saved in an easily accessible location. Put these in your cheatsheet too if possible. Finale and David are both fine lecturers, though I liked Finale better. Their lectures were not the worst (like hesterberg) but not the best (like Mickens). Not the most engaging for me. Its was the classic let’s just jump into it mentality where the teacher speaks for 60 minutes and attempts to transmit info to students. However, one must realize that an occasional joke or deliberately done diversion would go a long way towards keeping the lectures engaging. Please see James Mickens and ask for his wisdom in teaching.  One big feedback I want to give David is to preferably never say “After some SIMPLE computation, we get …” or its many variants. It’s one of the most demoralizing things to hear from lecturers. If the computation is elided for some x reason (such as too time consuming), say so. Say that it is in the book, so you won’t cover it here. However, saying that the topic is easy or simple doesn’t help anyone. Also, they should spend more time rehearsing their lectures and stop with the many erms, and umms. I find it extremely paternalistic to make attendance in lecture required. I do understand that the teacher teaching the lecture would feel that lectures are important. But why not let the students decide? Surely we are adults and we can make decisions according to our own situations. (Note that for Harvard students, the grade they get is pretty important, so they will usually do anything they feel is necessary to do well in a class).  For example, I lived in the quad and am not a good sleeper. Making it to my 9.45 am class is excruciating since I need more sleep than the average undergraduate here. Even in ideal conditions, i need to have at least 10 hours to function properly. Note that many assignments for classes are due at 11:59pm and so I can usually only sleep after that (among other reasons). Moreover, I am extremely skilled at listening to audio and watching stuff in high speeds (i.e 2.5–3.5x speeds) so it is mentally torturous for me to listen to people in real life speeds. Moreover, its impossible for me to take notes during lectures because the moment I focus on the notes, I miss the words said by the lecturers. Please please reconsider your attendance policy and have it be optional with perhaps a grade boost for attendance. I personally will literally forgo some attendance points to not attend lecture. I feel that strongly about my abilities as a student and in my conviction about lectures being bad. The two lectuers are not that good anyways, so why make lectures mandatory? What does attendance achieve that 2.5x panopto with me frequently stopping the video and taking notes doesn't achieve.

      "I’ve been fortunate to take many wonderful classes at Harvard (some of which were high–workload CS ones!). Unfortunately, CS 191 is my least favorite class. The course staff, particularly the more senior members, were slightly condescending throughout the course. I appreciate their wisdom and perspective from seeing CS from the true early days until now, but they consistently would make myself and my peers feels as if our points had no true bearing due to us “not being around back then.” There were many instances in which classmates’ ideas would be outright shut down or glossed over because they did not, in the course staff’s view, strictly adhere about discussion about the contents of the paper we were discussing. For something like one of the fundamental papers on AI, talking about ChatGPT, LLMs, or any more contemporary developments in the field (very arguably inspired by the paper in question) were considered “off–topic.” The conversation would then transition to members of the course staff speaking 90% of the time about how “it used to be.” To be clear, staff members lecturing about how things used to be is not bad in isolation (in fact, it’s actually pretty interesting!). The problem is that this comes at the expense of good discussion from students trying to do their best to contribute something based on their own perspectives (which I believe the course claims is a central part). Furthermore, most cases involve students being interrupted on the spot. Perhaps a takeaway here is that you only need to know the first five words of your discussion contribution when a staff member is at your table, as you will almost certainly get cut off at word #3.You have to submit reading responses for all the papers assigned. The final grade at the end is determined by a single creative video assignment. If you can imagine, the grading is extremely subjective and falls onto how “convinced” the teaching staff (the same staff aforementioned) feel about your argument. Generally, they will award an A, A–, or B+. However, it is up to you whether or not you want to play that game.There are some positives about CS 191. Professor Lewis is a legend in the field and it was wonderful hearing his insights. It was cool to see a broad history of CS through the papers and my discussion groups were great student–wise, so discussions were generally enjoyable. However, this is not enough in my opinion to recommend people take CS 191, especially since there are so many more interesting courses (both in CS and beyond!) available. For something more technical, look at another CS courses. For something more on the humanities side, consult any department other than CS!"

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! I don't usually write long reviews but I have to give KB and Brian their flowers. They are the absolute BEST teaching team and this class was the best I have ever taken at Harvard. They create a delightful classroom environment (warm, engaging, creative, relaxed, fun) and their focus on learning as a journey rather than a destination with set checkpoints allows you the space and freedom to fully explore your interests as you work on your semester–long project. The work load is super manageable as class only meets once a week and depending on your personal project, you choose how much time you put in. And you end up putting in the time because the work is so fun! The weekly design cases are so interesting to read and the collaborative classroom culture allows you to participate in other people's projects and be inspired by their work as well. There are no tests or exams, just the semester long project, but the course has plenty of built in check–ins and scaffolding to keep you on track. This class single–handedly made me excited to be a CS concentrator again (burnout is so real) and introduced me to the Education Studies department which I will now be taking more classes in. This is a class that just feels like what college SHOULD feel like. Literally no cons, no negatives, no complaints. Take this class then thank me later!!!"

In my case, having prior knowledge from courses like CS 61, CS 165, CS 265, CS 141, and CS 246 was incredibly helpful in understanding and connecting the concepts taught in this class.The teaching quality is satisfactory, with lecture presentations being a particularly useful resource for reviewing material, even if you cannot attend the lectures in person.The workload is generally manageable, but there is room for improvement in the scheduling of assignments. Having the last homework, final presentation, and final paper due within a short span during the reading period can be overwhelming. Adjusting these deadlines in future iterations of the course would greatly benefit students.Regarding grading and quizzes, there seems to be an emphasis on deducting points rather than providing constructive feedback. Some quiz questions, especially in the beginning, felt like they were designed to trick students rather than assess their understanding of the content. However, the quizzes did improve over time, focusing more on knowledge checks.The lab sessions, while helpful for projects and homework, have a mandatory attendance policy that feels unnecessary. Some students only attend to get the attendance link and then leave, as there is no substantial value in staying. Losing points for forgetting to attend a lab seems unfair, given the limited benefit of being present.Overall, CS 205 is a valuable class that can teach you a great deal, particularly if you have some background in the covered concepts. However, there is definitely room for improvement in terms of logistics and the grading approach.

You get exposed to lots of material, covering everything from individual and group fairness, learning complexity, regularity, multicalibration, outcome indistinguishability, omniprediction, better worlds, and simulations for real–world ideas, etc. In both the lectures and psets, you get very hands–on to the theory. The course gave me more confidence in understanding the roots of algorithmic fairness, and made me appreciate the overall hardness of the field. The course certainly builds your mathematical skills to understand various complex definitions and theorems.

A great follow–on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred–slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one’s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year–to–year): MOSFET circuits, RC–timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout–level inverter/nand/nor/half–adder/full–adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically–generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega–OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch–up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in. Additionally, the distinction in expectations need to be made more clear between 148/248."

      "Behold! For you have come across another legendary review! Not as legendary as Mickens though. TLDR: Easily the highlight of my semester just as CS61 was in the previous semester because of Mickens. Take this class even if you had no prior interest in systems security similar to me. The class is so engaging that it creates its own interest ;)Relevant Background: CS50, 61. Prior C++ experience through the previously mentioned courses only.  Similarly, experience with gdb through CS61 only. Time Statistics:I kept strict track of time spent on everything productive I did over the semester. The first time entry begins on January 22nd and each entry is one week's worth of time starting from the monday of the week. Spring break lacks time stats but I didn't work on stat that period.

Because of the schedule I had, I had so little time to actually dive deep into the topics in this class. This summer, I am definitely going back and doing a deeper dive. Every time I did the readings in the last hour, I knew that it was literally the only time I had, but also felt so much guilt since the lectures were made so much more clearer once I had read the paper. Professor Mickens, I am so sorry. The week to week of this class is not very time consuming as seen by the time data. Most weeks, there is only lecture and readings. The main time consumers for the class are the projects, both the pset ones and the final project. In order, the psets project topics are Buffer Overflows, Reverse Engineering, and Sandboxing. Since I knew that there were three projects, I recorded their time seperately. You can easily tell which weeks the psets were due above. The projects take some hefty time, so do not start on the last day like mine. The penalty is 10 percentage points per 16 hours of lateness for the first project and per 8 hours of lateness for the remaining psets. Look into ghidra for the reverse engineering pset. Look into VSCode ssh'ing into your AWS EC2 instance for project 1. The terminal, even with TMUX is not what I prefer. I had 4 VSCODE tabs/sections in one window each with a different terminal open. Have all the terminals you need open side by side so you can rapidly switch. I heavily recommend creating a custom gdb layout and making that the layout that gdb uses using .gdbinit. For project 3, look into the ptrace hint and read it fully before attempting the project. This is definitely a \"you get what you put in\" kind of class. The per–class paper responses are fairly easy to complete, especially if you have a fast reading speed or use a text–to–speech software like me. You should expect to spend about 30 minutes on the readings for the barest of minimums of understanding. 1–2 hours is better and you'll finish the papers and most likely understand a lot of the content within (perhaps a nice Goldilocks zone here). You should about 3–4 hours (over possibly 2–3 sessions) each week to really digest the material and have some followup prepared for Prof Mickens. He is EXTREMELY knowledgable about all parts of the course material.Prof Mickens' Office hours just after class are an amazing resource. You can ask him anything you'd like (not just about the course topics) and spend some amazing time learning the material. He received tenure fairly recently, but I am sure that he is/will become a legend of the field. He is certainly a legendary lecturer. I do not say this lightly. He is the BENCHMARK for any other class I take now and no one comes even close. In a way, he has ruined every single other CS class at harvard through his raising the bar so high. The course feedback is extremely late by even other class standards. I think we got the first pset back when 80% of the semester was done. I got my second and third pset grade about 3–4 days ago end of semester. Since each pset is so unrelated to the rest of the readings, lectures, and projects, it actually doesn't affect you if you do get a good or bad grade, but still, perhaps the course can improve the time to feedback. This is a grad class, and so office hour support is comparatively low. There were just two TFs and a total of 4 office hours. They were also held middle of the day, so prepare to not be able to make 1–2 of them. Unfortunately, I think the two TFs had the same time for one of their office hours which makes one unattendable by design. I forget if that time arrangement continued for the second and third psets. During the weeks with no projects, there are only office hours by Prof Mickens. The Ed Board is fairly active and you can expect to get an answer in about 1–2 days. Don't expect fast responses from the staff and plan accordingly. Perhaps form a mini study group for discussions. I didn't have one for the first two projects and it severely affected me (though they were hard projects to begin with).  Overall a solid S tier class. If you liked CS61, this is a natural class to take. If you only have CS61, you can still take the class. Your coding experience will be enough. However, I think you should have more experience with gdb as my gdb experience from CS61 was not enough I think. To that end, the gdb guide that Prof Mickens posted is really helpful."

      "I’m someone who’s generally interested in AI for Social Impact and the project/QReports for this class made it seem like a great option. I was wrong.Pros:– If you pick a good final project and group, it can honestly be really cool and fun; thankfully I got lucky with this part.– The “survey paper” (new for this year) is long and tedious, but can still be a good learning experience.– Some of the guest speakers do awesome work and are great to meet before/after/outside of class.Cons:– The atmosphere during class is awful — genuinely one of the most uninspiring environments I’ve experienced at Harvard. 90% of the class is on their laptops (including TFs), guest lecturers sometimes talk for the full 75 minutes with barely any breaks or discussions, and multiple times the teaching staff would come in with no content for the day but expect everyone to stay for a “work period.”– The teaching staff are nice but can be pretty ridiculous. They randomly decided to add an assignment that wasn’t on the syllabus halfway through the semester, constantly loosened/tightened requirements and deadlines, and were too vague about assignments. An example: at 3pm on the day of the final project deadline, they sent an email clarifying that an 8–page paper meant “maximum 8 pages” and insisting that we cut our papers to that length if they were longer. Seriously?– The assignments can be poorly thought through — insensible page counts, back–to–back deadlines, paper responses that prompt zero originality or discussion (these ended up being 300–word summaries where everyone says the same thing and nobody cares to read what anyone else wrote)."

      "No background is needed for this course. The strength of this course is that it is really an intro class. We go over the same concepts several times with each time going a little bit deeper into the foray. So, we are always progressing but nothing too jarring or too quick in this class.  Dave always stops to ask if we don't understand anything and is really big on the whole there is a no dumb question thing. I really appreciate it as someone who doesn't have the best background for this kind of thing. I wished we had powerpoints and slides that can help with understanding because sometimes the lecture material seems to be sprouting from Dave's mind, and Dave is going to get it because he has a PhD but that leaves in a wild loop. The psets were different from the material taught in class because we are asked to deal with real data sets, which is really cool, but also really jarring considering that class only goes over the fundamental concepts. You would need to go to office hours to really understand what to do for the questions that require special equations. If I were to be totally honest, I think I can only apply those equations to the problems that I saw on the psets and it would not be applicable anywhere else, but still very cool regardless. Haley is very cool with grading and helps my understanding a lot with her comments. Haley will not be TFing this class anymore though because SHE GOT HER PHD and is too cool for school now. I would say this topic is relatively niche. You will be in class with people who are semi to very interested in this topic so group assignments are always fun and passionate."

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Eli is an incredible professor, my favorite that I've learned from at Harvard, and this is by far my favorite course I've taken.  Lcture was engaging, and despite the sometimes difficult math, Eli's charisma always made everything more digestible. He always circles back and explains difficult concepts, and never moves on before everyone felt comfortable with concepts. He's willing to work one one–on–one with hard material, and his office hours are a great way to get extra help. He also makes the class incredibly fun with a field trip, presentations, video projects, and zeta–drawing contests. He truly cares about every student enjoying the class and succeeding in it. Most worthwhile class I've taken at Harvard."

He touches on global climate policy, broad climate change, the history of atmospheric research, and makes the class incredibly engaging. I learned so much in a class setting where I felt comfortable with the professor, able to ask any questions I had, and with a support system to help me succeed. The HW's are doable with or without office hours (although they're definitely easier if you go to office hours), and follow lecture and section very closely. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic, but also just anyone wanting to engage with material focused on the causes of global warming."

I feel like we bounced from topic to topic. I loved learning how to use the models and wished the class had focused a bit more on modeling specifically. If you have background in environmental engineering and are interested in better understanding how to quickly understand the threat that chemicals pose or if you are interested in the science that underpins policy decisions, then I recommend this class! It's really informative and Elsie is super kind. The final project was quite challenging (this year it was a 5–7 minute video) because I had never done something like that before, but I think it will be different next year so don't let that influence you. Really cool subject matter that is important to know, but the class in general could be more streamlined."

Having taken Chinese Ba, I found myself continuing to find study habits that best worked for me, and as of finishing the course, I now feel very confident in my ability to learn new vocabulary and grammar structures. While many people find it tedious to handwrite every homework assignment, I found that it becomes easier with time, as long as you are trying your best to write new characters from memory when possible. Compared to Chinese Ba, it was during this course that I started to observe more fundamental patterns and ideas in Chinese, whereas previously the learning process felt more like I was only learning the content needed for a single niche topic or discussion. Individuals of all backgrounds take this course, so it is certainly worth giving it a try, especially with how generous the faculty is grading and extra credit–wise."

The course is interesting; every lesson is exciting, and really gives you the opportunity to improve your Chinese. Some assignments are not super helpful and feel like busy work, but I appreciate how low–stakes the assessments are –– I was never worried about my grade, and this let me focus on improving my language skills without trying to game assessments. It can be hard to fit Chinese into your schedule as it meets every day, but in my experience the course heads have been more than helpful in accommodating students who need to come to class at different times each day.  Course materials – text book, audio recordings, grammar/vocab handouts, homeworks – are all very useful resources. Feedback is given with care and in a very constructive way – students are allowed to grow in their language skill without feeling insecure. CHNSE BA  or equivalent is sufficient. This is an excellent, if not slightly time–consuming (meets 5 days, homework, projects, revision for 4 major tests, dictation twice a week, individual session outside of class), way to meet a language requirement. I cannot stress this enough: the course staff are the heart and soul of this subject and my semester was greatly improved by knowing them."

Towards the end of the class it was harder to keep up with all the new vocab, but for the most part I really enjoyed the course.

The instructors are all always so great and very invested in ensuring your level of understanding and fluency of the language is not surface level and something that you'd forget after half a year. I also really appreciated how the class was not solely focused on improving language (grammar, vocabulary, etc.), but it also heavily integrated content about Chinese culture, history, philosophy, and politics (like past governments and political thought!) into the language aspect; I really learned a TON from the class, and even though I (admittedly) started slacking off a bit in the latter third of the semester, I still reaped a lot out of it and am excited to apply it to my own communication with my parents and relatives in China!"

      "I cannot recommend this class enough! I came into this semester pretty uncertain about whether I wanted to take this class because I was worried it would be too hard (I had just finished 140a). The class was certainly a challenge — I had to block of quite a bit of time over the weekend to do the weekly readings and at times it felt like I was reading at a snails pace — but overall it was extremely doable. The teaching staff provides so much support to make it possible. There are vocab lists every week with key vocabulary that helps a lot for the readings. Because the texts are a bit challenging your Chinese improves quite noticeably over the course of the class which is great. You also have a one on one meeting with the TFs every week to answer questions, discuss the texts, and get feedback on your paper. The paper is super scaffolded because you only have to turn in a short chunk of it every other week. I will flag that you have to come up with your paper topic extremely early in the semesters, though, so I would start thinking about that right away. The one caveat I will say for this class is that there are *a lot* of assignments and deadlines. But the grading is extremely generous and there's extra credit, so while you have a fair bit to do every week grades are not a concern.Ultimately, it was extremely rewarding to feel that years of studying Chinese has paid off to the point where instead of learning to read in Chinese I am now reading to learn. The stories are so delightful and Professor Wang’s lectures are absolutely phenomenal, providing historical context and analysis of the texts. I learned so much about Chinese history and culture through this class. Please take this class!!!"

I can't speak for other students who may have grown up with Mandarin Chinese as their first language, but as someone who's a lot more comfortable reading and writing in English than Chinese, this was an enjoyably challenging class to take. Many of the authors that Prof. Wang sets are in the mainstream consciousness, but a good number of them are rather less known, and it's fascinating to see how their fictional worlds diverge from the other fiction that I've read in English for other classes. The material is difficult but very rewarding; Prof. Wang is so knowledgeable (and knows many of these authors personally), handles student questions very elegantly, and he dissects concepts in a way that makes them accessible. If you're confident with your Chinese ability, take this class!"

What you put in what you get out. The freedom that you have with the final paper and assignments leading up to it really allow you to dig deeper into what you are passionate/curious about.

Professor Abe is so kind, patient, and knowledgeable, and most importantly, imbued with wisdom (or, if not, as least seems to be). The texts you read in the first half of the semester are translations of Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist classics, and the second half is of literary texts that are laced with concepts from the three. Although the readings can be a struggle to keep up with sometimes (particularly as a humanities major, including this class, I had 2 other classes that were also each a book per week), they are definitely worth the time.This class will teach you how to be a more compassionate human being, and how to build a life of peace, happiness, and contentment for yourself (truly!). Perhaps it'll even help you achieve your own form of enlightenment.Although you definitely don't have to have any background in East Asian religions or schools of thought for this class (Abe can bring you up to speed), I think that it definitely doesn't hurt to have some general knowledge about them, as it was quite enjoyable to see things you grew up around to be put into words and verse before your eyes. Then again, it might also be more enlightening as someone completely new to it, as the revelations and concepts may have an even more profound impact to someone with fresh eyes."

He is very approachable and offers incredible, thoughtful feedback. The content itself was also interesting. Each week is a new topic (i.e. border areas, environmentalism, BRI) but it is fascinating to see the intersection and themes, which Prof. Koss does a great job of conveying through lecture and drawing out through discussion. The map unit was also phenomenal. Though some found it challenging, it was a unique opportunity that lent itself to rather fun midterm and final projects."

      "This class is rewarding, but it is A LOT of work. There are at least two worksheets and two quizzes every two weeks, and they will take longer than you expect to complete. I regularly spent 2–3 hours on each worksheet. I honestly believe this is one of the most intensive language classes offered at Harvard, so while I highly recommend it, do not expect an easy class.This class is structured around the readings, which aren't very long but often have sections that are difficult to comprehend. You will be reading aloud in class (a lot), but there will often be a lot of unfamiliar vocabulary so you should definitely read the passages before class if possible. Reading comprehension is a really big part of this class and probably one of the skills you will develop the most. Wednesday sections will give you a break from the readings and often focus more on grammar and conversation. All classes are very interactive, and most of the time will be spent reading aloud, answering reading comprehension questions, and discussing questions with your classmates.Get to know your classmates! The teachers are amazing and very good at what they do, but you can learn just as much from your peers.  Talking to other Japanese students outside of class will increase your exposure and give you a chance to use Japanese outside of class. It will also make studying for tests and working on major assignments both more fun and more effective."

      "Great teachers, too much homework. Noh 선생님, Lindsay 선생님, and You 선생님 were all fantastic teachers. They all teach well, are approachable, and are understanding. I hope for the future 120B classes they reduce the amount of homework. We already meet every day. But in a typical Korean 120B week we had multiple vocabulary quizzes, an essay, a recording project with a partner, a one on one speaking practice zoom call, workbook homework (like 4–5 pages per), and of course every few weeks a lesson test. I only complain because I feel like a lot of the work was unnecessary and unhelpful towards progressing my language skills. Mostly everything about lecture and section was super positive. Section is super fun and more fun than lecture becuase its a smaller class size and so you have more opportunity to talk with your peers, etc. But that's kind of the point of section vs. lecture. Lecture they want to drill into your head like 2–3 grammar concepts and then section they want you to practice those grammar concepts with others.The vocabulary quizzes became pretty hard from 120A to 120B. They essentially became grammar quizzes and we all know grammar is harder than vocabulary to \"study\" for. 120B they introduced full sentence completion and more nuanced, \"trap\" grammar questions. 120A vocabulary quizzes were straightforward to study for and easy to bag 10/10s on but I found that in 120B they became complicated to prep for and I was getting 7/10s even though I put in the same studying effort as 120A. Overall I kinda had to take this class as I had already taken 120A in the Fall and planned to do 120B in back to back semesters. But if someone had told me in advance that the jump from 120A to 120B in terms of attention to detail and workload was a thing, I would've been appreciative."

      "I think BB is very similar to BA, but the only thing that was eh was the faster pace in general such as learning all the words to which there's a lot more to remember before the quizzes, and a lot of them are new).  I felt like the quizzes threw in some random (or a word you wouldn't commonly use) word from the quizlet and because there's so many words to study, you don't really expect it at least for me. But overall, still a class that you can get an A in, and cô Hoa is super supportive and kind!Highly recommend continuing with BB!"

      "TAKE EC970 WITH CIRRUS. PLEASE. YOU MUST. Not only is he chill, but it will be one of the most memorable Harvard experiences you'll ever have. I've learned beyond just the course material, as Cirrus never fails to launch class with a deep philosophical (oftentimes, economic) question and then ties it all back to the topic of the paper at hand. You'll get real–time feedback on your research for the final paper, helping you avoid headaches later down the road. This is, by far, one of the best sophomore tutorials out there. Who knew that a concentration requirement could be...fun?!? Once again, I do not simply recommend, I IMPLORE that you put this class in, at the very least, the top three of your lottery list. Trust me, if the topic of digitization seems intimidating, you talk about much more than just the dawn of computers. This will feel like one of the most authentically \"Harvard\" classes you'll ever take—open conversation about our world, in a comfortable judgment–free environment."

      "Tutorial with Felter is great, especially if you're considering law school! He is so caring and truly invested in his students. It's very easy to schedule office hours with him (and will always offer to buy you a cookie/coffee). Work–wise... it's intense, more than most econ sophomore tutorials so keep that in mind. Readings reached up to 100 pages a week and came with discussion questions (not graded but you definitely needed to do them since the class is so small and discussion heavy. The hardest part was balancing the readings with the ~weekly writing assignments. Papers ranged from 500–3000 words and at one point, we had a paper due every week for about a month straight, which was the most difficult time of my entire semester. I did way more work than my friends in other economics tutorials but Felter's grading makes up for it. I never worried about my grade in his class and his feedback is detailed and thoughtful. My final research paper is probably my proudest accomplishment of my college experience thus far and Felter was a big help (I did do the coding portion by myself but he's a great asset for the actual writing/topic). I highly recommend taking Econometrics before tutorial because you need experience in STATA to do the PSETs and final paper. Content–wise, it's more interesting than not but the class does start off slow and by the end, we were just trying to survive with all the papers so discussion was lacking a bit and you could tell. Overall, Felter is great (takes us out for lunch at the end of the semester, is very knowledgeable on all things law, and is just a cool guy). Highly recommend if you're willing to put in a little more work!"

Prof. Pallais is a wonderful lecturer, class sessions are enjoyable and informative, and assignments are straight–forward and reasonable. You learn how to think about experiments in new ways and be better able to critically evaluate claims people make about experimental designs. You might even discover a topic you're interested in pursuing for a senior thesis or just otherwise (on the flip side, the midterm and final papers are so open that you can continue to explore existing interests/organizations you're already part of). Make sure to go to the TF and Prof. Pallais for feedback on your midterm and final paper ideas so they can make them even stronger. Also, don't be fooled by the first topic listed on the syllabus: we skate by regression discontinuity and diff–in–diff designs –– the course talks about them just to say what we're ~not~ focusing on. So don't take this class thinking you're going to investigate them. It's really just about experimental designs, but those are very interesting in their own right."

      "Writing a thesis is hard work—as prepared as you think you are, you will run into huge setbacks, results will fail to materialize, data will not show up or will not contain the variables you think they do, and you will surely be behind on writing and editing in the weeks before it is due. That being said, writing a thesis is also the most academically gratifying experience I've had at Harvard, and I think that is true for basically everyone I know who wrote one. This is likely the only project you will get to design fully and implement, and I'm so happy and proud that I did it. Econ 985 specifically is a great course. It's low–stakes, because the thesis grade replaces the course grade that you get, and all of the instructors sound great. Kiran was the absolute best, hands down, but since she's not teaching a thesis seminar next year I won't waste time telling you how wonderful she is. Having related interests to your seminar leader doesn't seem all that important; if you can, prioritize being in a similar seminar group to people that you like and find interesting, because you spent a lot of time with your peers.

      "Foote is a great professor, his lectures are engaging and he is super helpful in answering questions and helping you understand the material. Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that the course is really badly designed and not set up for students' success. 90% of your grade is from the midterm + final means it's really important you do well, but the MCQs are honestly ridiculous. Instead of standard ABCD options, you'll get ABCDE and options D and E are things like A and B are true or B and C are true. The tests will ask about some professor's research we talked about for like two minutes, ten weeks ago, and expect you to remember in detail what they said. It is super nitpicky. I would much rather they incorporate short answer/long answer like 1010a if they really want to test your understanding or incorporate psets so that less weight is given to the exams. I would recommend taking this in the fall, I heard the grading system is much better. If you want to do well in the course, I would recommend going to sections weekly and doing the section problem sets. I did that every week and I honestly do not feel great about the final, but it definitely helped me develop a better understanding of the material. Make sure to do the practice exams because the test format is really tricky. This is definitely the hardest Econ class I've taken so far and probably my least favourite."

Tests were a bit tricky, but Prof Cramer is very receptive to feedback so I wouldn't worry too too much about that. overall, very fun course, decently laid back (no sections!) but with lots of intellectual reward. take it!!"

Lectures were typically broken up into review of last week’s material, and new material, which was helpful. There are four psets throughout the entire semester, but they were usually only 4 questions long. Psets 1, 2, and 4 were all very manageable. If you follow along in class & go to section(please to go section, it’s where you’ll learn how to apply the concepts learned in class and also go over problems that are analogous to the ones on the pset. Also, our TF Mehar was amazing, but she is graduating so not sure who the TF will be next year. Your TF will absolutely make or break your success in this class!!), you’ll be okay on the psets, and they don’t take very long. Pset 3 was definitely by far the most tedious pset, so please budget extra time for it. There is a long reading list for this class, but honestly, you can get by without having read any of the readings — just pay attention in class, especially during Unit 4 because the essay prompts on the final exam will be largely based off of Unit 4. Lecture can be hard to follow and confusing at times, and I know many people who skipped lecture often and still did well on the psets. I would encourage going to lecture if you can though, we play a lot of fun in class games (if you win you get money too!) that demonstrate the theory we are learning. The class overall can feel an unstructured sometimes, but I took away many lessons from game theory overall, and would recommend with slight reservations. if you want a more in–depth understanding of game theory, I would probably take another class. However, if you’re looking for a chill introduction, this is it! Learn a decent amount, light workload, and great vibes overall!"

As a non–economics concentrator, I found it easy to understand the content for the response papers and exams just by attending lectures and sections (the lectures were not extremely engaging and attendance dwindled, so simply showing up and reinforcing the content in section puts you in a good position). The midterm was rushed in terms of timing but fair in terms of content, and the final addressed the timing issues and would replace the midterm grade if you did better on it, showing that the instructors care about students doing well in the course. Overall, the content in the course is incredibly interesting and important to know if you're interested in the disparity of outcomes between countries.

I also gained an appreciation for which subfields are most interesting to me. Professor Shleifer's lectures were thorough, well–explained, and entertaining, and left much room and flexibility for students to ask interesting questions. I most enjoyed the opportunity to get to know and spend time conducting work under Professor Shleifer. He offered pointed and encouraging feedback, always with much foresight. Going to his HBS office was always a treat too. Second to that, another one of favorite aspects of this class was the guest lectures; Professor Shleifer invites quality guest lecturers to present on timely topics, and it aids in the diversity of the content that we consume in the course. Lastly, I enjoyed the diversity of perspectives that were offered by our class cohort. You will learn much from observing and listening to your classmates and how they engaged with the readings."

That being said, the course is somewhat dry, and VERY light (I spent maybe 2–3 hours outside of class per week, including on the psets which were mostly verbal and conceptual and not very rigorous). Correspondingly, the lectures were very colloquial and approachable, since this course is tailored for the ESPP concentration. This was my fifth class, and it was perfect for that.

      "Professor Stein is a wonderful professor, and I thoroughly enjoyed this class! I learned SO MUCH about how the financial system works, and it actually helped me a lot in Ec1011b, which I also took this past semester. The assignments are a series of case studies and referee reports where you'll read an economic paper or case study and write your thoughts about it. They were on pretty cool topics similar to what we would discuss in lecture, so they were not terribly hard to complete. As a sophomore in the class, I sometimes felt a little in over my head during lecture since I had not completed intermediate macro or a finance internship like a lot of the upperclassmen had. On one hand, taking it as a junior or senior is better because you'll have more experience with the material from other ec classes, internships, or even IB recruiting prep (a lot of my relevant knowledge came from the M&I 400 lol). On the other hand, taking it sophomore year was nice because it helped in Ec1011b and recruiting. Regardless of when you take it, it is an awesome class, and you will have a much better understanding of the world because of it."

      "this class is a lot of fun and i feel like i learned a lot! however, the presentations left a lot to be desired. most of the time, people were reading slides word for word and just lightly skimming over what we'd read. i think, in my opinion, the point of readings outside of class are such that, during lecture, they can be connected and gone in on more depth, and it more so i felt like i'd done the readings and then just listened to the abstract of each of them in class. that's not necessarily the teaching staff's fault, but i think providing more guidance for what the presentations should look like would be helpful on their end. the guidance that i remember getting when it was my week to present wasn't super helpful and was pretty surface level; maybe they could provide a specific successful slideshow and talk about why that was successful in particular – ie. the students worked to connect the sources and paint a larger picture rather than keeping them siloed, or the students connected them to other weeks, etc. i'm not sure, it just felt like it could have been more engaging.but again! everyone in the class is lovely, the teaching staff are great, and i still learned a lot :)"

      "Absolutely wonderful introduction to what it's really like to be a teacher, and the types of decisions you'll have to make as a teacher to craft an effective classroom. The class covers a wide range of important educational topics, but perhaps the most useful is the impromptu class discussions that often resulted from our own curiosities and Beth's storytelling. She has incredible wisdom and gives great practical advice regarding teaching, which is really nice to see in a school that is so theoretical. Class assignments are not stressful and are really engaging, they get you to think about who you really want to be as a teacher. And the classroom environment is so comfortable, with a ton of engaging activities and real–world discussions. Everyone brings their own perspective on teaching, and while the class may leave you with more questions than you started with, you'll quickly realize how challenging (but exciting and enriching) teaching can be! A can't miss class for those interested in teaching."

I always found myself feeling like each class session passed by in minutes, even though the class was 3 hours long! I'd really use this class as a chance to explore your passion and find a specific interest within the education system. I also would take advantage of every assignment and guest speaker in the class to get the most out of it! The school visit assignment, in my perspective, was one of the best educational experiences I've had at Harvard or prior. This class is a must–take if you're truly interested in looking into urban schools and elements of segregation, school choice, and other important education–related topics (which you can find on the syllabus!)."

      "my god, this was such a wonderful course. Prof. Pia's enthusiasm for the material is infectious, and she and head TF Alex were so great to work with and knowledgeable about the material. The small class size means that it was really easy to get familiar with everyone, and Pia really encouraged open discussions and exploration. Class is 2x a week, no additional lab or discussion sections. The workload was practically nonexistent outside of class other than a few short readings, a short midterm project, and the final project (which is when you might really have to invest time into the class / come to the lab during non–class hours, based on what question you want to study). I ended up doing a solo project while most people worked in groups, which Pia and Alex were super supportive of, and helped me with planning the components and making sure that they were feasible to complete within the allotted timeframe. They absolutely encouraged students to dig into what interested them. The classes were also filled with lots of delicious fermentation experiments, many of which are very reproducible at home! but maybe not in a student dorm lol. The field trips to breweries, labs, etc. were also super interesting! I was also thesising during the semester, and this was an absolutely great class to balance with that workload and other more time–consuming stem classes. Overall, absolute gem for anybody and everybody, and I can't recommend this course enough, even just to hang out with/talk to Pia and Alex on a regular basis!"

You can build anything, do anything. Super cool hands on experience in lab! The labs are pretty challenging/intensive though. The psets are very long and difficult. Start them early and do them with friends. Also, don't pick the lab section that happens during Wednesday Mega EE office hours. You're going to want to go to those OH. Marko is super nice so you should go out of your way to talk to him. His office hours are also extremely helpful since he knows this material like the back of his hand."

In the last 2 weeks, especially during reading period my team and I were in lab everyday for 5–8 hours in order to get the robot working. Additionally, start your psets early, especially any pset with CAD. The psets offer interesting questions but they can often be complicated to solve so go to office hours. The TFs for the class are incredibly helpful in solving the problems, helping with CAD, and explaining any content from class."

      "I came into EWB expecting to perform meaningful work that would actually be similar to how a real engineering company approaches building out solutions for communities. Instead, I found a such a bureaucratic class that focused so much on procedure and busy work at the expense of actually being a worthy learning experience for a Harvard class slot. Most people who review this course will probably feel neutral to positive about it if, but from what I saw, your experience is largely a function of what team you’re on and who your PL’s are. I enjoyed my PL’s as people, but when it came to what I think they could have done, I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunity. Regarding course structure, I really do think that it was not very effective nor well thought out. My experience was full of going back and forth between stakeholders and not having the freedom nor given the resources to effectively take ownership. There is more of a focus on timeliness and sinking effort into making things look good rather than actually learning useful material.  And right now, there are also questions regarding how much some of the communities we serve actually need us, something that is quite troubling and demotivating when the whole purpose of the course is teaching by creating impact.It’s a fine course, I just feel that it could have been so much more academically/work wise. I think there’s an excellent community in EWB facilitated by the one and only BELLA (as well as Aiden and the others who make the class less boring)!! and I really enjoyed the times I was able to tap into it. Lombardo is chill and I think a cool guy overall, definitely talk to him and get to know him. EWB is a great concept and pretty awesome when looking over the long term, I just think its implementation on the day–to–day needs some work, and I am giving this feedback because I want to see the class improve and anyone coming it to know what my perspective on it was on. It is just one of a variety of experiences, you will likely have a much different one depending on what project/team/PL you have :)"

      "The course is pretty disorganized in my opinion. I took it because I had to, as many others who took the course did, but it could definitely be structured better. Joost is super cool, but does not have any lecture slides, lecture recordings, and doesn't write very legibly. I really encourage him to record his lectures in the future. The midterms and exams are infamously difficult with the averages usually being a failing grade. However, the course should be curved, TBD currently on how fair this curve is but I scored right around average for the most of my exams. TFs aren't the best either unfortunately. We can never get through more than 1–2 questions per office hours, and I feel like they often struggle to interpret the answer keys. Even more, there are no practice exams for any of the midterms or exams. We are given a random assortment of practice questions that the TFs put together and for two of the exams, these were literally released within 24 hours of the exam... To be honest it didn't matter that much though because the content didn't match up super well for any of the exams either. The content of the course is pretty foundational for engineering majors in my opinion, but the course is taught a bit dysfunctionally. Avoid the course if you can take another course for your requirements, but find some good pset friends if you must take the class."

The class had a policy where if an assignment is expected to take 120 minutes, then you were expected to not go over that limit too much. You could turn in your potentially partially finished assignment and get full credit. The main thing was to put in effort. I personally felt way better about this class because of that and it made me work to understand the material better than to chase homework completion since completion wasn't the target, honest hard work was. The class is HEAVILY group based, so you must either join the class with a group of friends or make friends in the class to group up with. So, be prepared for that. You group can make or break your midterm and final projects. Most likely, you won't be able to change your project group after the midterm project since the class is so small and the other groups will be pretty calcified by then. So expect to do both projects with the same people. Learn each others' strengths, weaknesses, and schedules for the best cooperation. I had absolutely no time to prepare for the final project presentation, BUT my teammates pulled through hard. Then, when they had their exams, I was the one who had nothing to do and I tried to carry the team then. Play to your strengths and schedules! The pre–session assignments and readings are CRITICAL for being able to implement the midterm and final projects, so you should be VERY FAMILIAR with those and don't half ass it. This is where the leniancy of the class comes back to bite you. I still don't know Backprojection and 3D point mapping well and that meant that in the final project, I was useless for part of it. This should not be you. Learn it well. This class is extremely applied in terms of linear algebra. Know transposition, inversion and its properties, Singular value decomposition, matrix equations as linear system of equations etc. Beyond that, I would argue you should have an INTUITIVE understanding of what effect a matrix has in terms of its effect on a vector. Perhaps the 3Blue1Brown Linear algebra series will help. Consider reading up on projective geometry for extra prep. Get familiar with openCV and numpy and you'll thank yourself. Since I had experience with them, the class was made significantly easier. Learn to use chatGPT well since it is allowed and even encouraged in class. Overall, not much to say about the class. It was an easier class compared to Stat 111, CS181, 263. It wasn't a gem per se, but it was certainly not a hard class. It had its moments of being the hardest things on my plate and it had weeks where I just didn't do much for it. All by design of the class I think. A very doable class and a very gentle but firm introduction to computer vision, the less talked about cousin of AI/ML applications. Best of Luck!"

      "Absolutely take this class. It is the most well–taught STEM class I've taken at Harvard as a CS concentrator. It covers the same foundational material (and CS concentration requirement) as STAT 110 without as much pain. This is largely due to Professor Lu's excellent teaching and the very organized class structure. Lectures are no–fluff, clear, informative, and informal enough that everyone is comfortable asking questions.The content itself is extremely applicable to any field (CS, any engineering application, reading papers, poker / gambling, finance). Every lecture, you walk out knowing something new, useful, and understand how you can use it in the real world. That's not something that happens much in most Harvard CS courses.PSETs and labs are challenging, but very doable. They feel like puzzles in the optimal level of difficulty. Exams open note, very fair, and their content is clearly communicated before hand. The course notes on Overleaf are very comprehensive and a great way to review.Lecture is the highlight of this course. I wish Professor Lu taught more courses. I found myself thinking, \"wow if he taught some of my other courses, they would be so much better!\""

It is largely theory/math but includes a bit of programming towards the end. Balances between communication/Fourier theory and practical implementation. A strong mathematical background (orthogonal bases, integration, complex numbers, trig) is preferable.Professor: Flavio is an amazing lecturer and is great to chat with. Lectures are a mix between the blackboard and the slides, a clever balance since the more theoretical/math parts of the course are better on the blackboard while the more computational/implementation side is better on the slides. Textbooks: Oppenheim is the main textbook, the readings are recommended for deeper understanding. The other two are supplemental. 1. Signals and Systems, 2nd Edition, by A.V. Oppenheim and A.S.

There are no lecture slides or any teaching of content that you weren't expected to read about beforehand. PSETs were very reasonable except for the fact that you actually have little guidance on what is actually important from the \"readings\". there were no practice exams for the midterm or the final so no one had a clue of what was going to come up unless you make it to office hours if your lucky enough to have that time available in the week. Labs were good and were actually a pleasant break from lecture. final project was fine but it would have been better to have more time for a more thorough final project rather than a final exam (this class has both a final project and a final exam ). Section is great and Griff is wonderful soul who cares for his students and made the class bearable. Heat transfer is an interesting topic but please consider if you as an engineer really need to do an entire semester on radiation, conduction and convection. the class used to incorporate mass transfer too which I recommend that they revert to. Also I thought this class would teach me COMSOL but it didnt. we had two classes on COMSOL where we essentially followed a step by step pre made guide from the active learning labs."

Think about topics for your final project early, since time flies and there is much liberty in what you do, but you need to set your own benchmarks and progress check–ins, since that is all left up to the student. Study really hard in the beginning leading up to the midterm, because the class calms down immensely in the second half, but you'll need everything from the first half to do well on the midterm, and probably will use some of that in your final project. The class is very well structured, and there is ample support for deliverables.

The problem sets are all formal proofs (no coding), and the second half of the semester is reading papers in control theory (not control applications). You can do an implementation project at the end of the course, but for anyone really interested in engineering solutions for control, you might be better off in a different class.For coursework, the class is split into two parts. For the first half of the semester, there is a PSet due every two weeks. Read the book religiously–––the lectures were copied straight from the book, and it was extremely helpful for problem sets. The problems aren't too bad if you give yourself enough time. Once problem sets stop and reading reflections begin, expect to spend a lot of time reading papers on linear control theory bounds and scratching your head wondering how useful the stuff really is. I thought it got better at the very end when we started looking at MPC and RL, and that stuff is really useful!"

Also, you will be randomly assigned to present critiques of the paper during certain classes, but if you do the reading and come to class with a few points, you will be in good shape. There are also a few online lectures that you you have to watch for the midterm. Midterm is open–note and doable if you understand the lectures and review journal club papers. Lab is very time–consuming, especially the weeks after spring break where we design and run our own experiments. Expect to come into lab every 2–3 days if you split work with your group.

Sometimes it's difficult to understand what a question is tasking you to do, so just coming back to it during OH saved me hours. This course is very doable and enjoyable, especially if you do not have many pset classes. Presentations at the end of class were not too stressful.

ES 277 requires more in–class work than the typical class, but it is made up for by a comparatively low homework load. I highly recommend this class to people who plan to work in microfabrication or immediately adjacent fields (e.g. circuit design, or photonics).

      "For context, I am a STEM concentrator who took this class as an elective. This was my third creative fiction course:I'm in my last semester as an undergrad –– this course has been the greatest I've taken in my four years at Harvard, no sensationalism. Claire did an amazing job leading/facilitating discussion. Unlike other creative writing courses I've been in, she generally stepped back and allowed the students to direct conversation on pieces as we saw fit.As a facet of this being an advanced writing class (meaning you must have taken a fiction writing course previously), there was a high level of engagement from the entire class. Discussion flowed naturally without any disingenuous desire to say something just to check off the box of speaking. Everyone was encouraged to submit whatever they saw fit, even if it pushed the boundaries of what we call fiction. Reading everyone else's works pushed me to be a more thoughtful writer. I felt encouraged to try my hardest in whatever I wrote. This class felt like a privilege and experience much more than a class.The deep level of engagement –– both as a writer and in the comments given to me –– will surely stick with me for years. It's very difficult to summarize how amazing this course was. If writing is something you want to keep in your life, take this course. The amount of effort you put in compounds into what you get out. I cannot recommend this course more, even compared to other creative writing courses here. The only way you could take this course and feel dissatisfied is if you decline to put time or effort into what you submit.Claire was very forward looking in her approach to teaching this course. Takeaways weren't just with regard to the specific work, but also more general in ideas to how we write as a whole. She also subtly encouraged us to become friends with one another. I've taken writing courses where I left without feeling like I really knew anyone else in the class, but the way this class was structured I feel close to everyone. She created a community of writers out of thin air. If you love fiction writing, this course is out of a dream. Truly, I'm glad I took it so late in college so that I didn't compare everything else to it –– every other course pales in comparison."

Nowhere else will you be able to be surrounded by such talented peers and be able to critique each other's writing in a supportive and open–minded environment. As a CS concentrator who was interested in simply writing more, I found this course to be extremely eye–opening in thinking about all the different creative approaches that different authors take in writing \"nonfiction,\" which can be anything from a personal essay to magazine piece, and also gaining a set of rigorous frameworks for thinking about good writing. I would definitely put this among the top 3 classes that I've taken during my time here at Harvard."

Truthfully, I would take this class even if the readings took me twenty hours a week (they don't). That's just how much I got out of it.

Professor Wilson made everything digestible. And her lectures are substantial and generally wonderful to listen to.Professor Wilson is highly knowledgeable. Come to her office hours. Get her feedback on the final project. Ask her questions during and after class. You'll be glad you did. You'll come away from this class having learned that much more if you choose to engage with her. She's awesome.Assignments are VERY fun. Discussion posts in other classes can feel like a slog, but trust me –– Professor Wilson's are thought–provoking, accessible, and quite nice to do. The other assignments were also very creatively designed. The final project was a joy to do –– something I'd be excited to go home and work on –– and it was by far my favorite final this semester. ALSO, for your copy of the tales, GET THE E–BOOK.Being able to search in the text was a lifesaver. Highlighting and annotation were a part of the deal, so there were no disadvantage to not having the paper copy. And I paid $20 less than I would have for the paper copy. Highly recommend.

On the other hand, if you do the readings and participate, this class can be incredible. I wish I had adopted more of the latter mentality, especially towards the end of the semester. Assignments are very chill and grading is not too harsh. Both the Professor and the TF are incredibly passionate about the subject matter, and if you put some thought into it, it can be pretty cool. I'd just issue a warning that this course draws a lot of religious people who are very passionate about this story and Genesis. Coming from a less religious background, I did not feel such a personal connection to the story. However, I think it's a solid class that everyone can learn a lot from. It's a good way to kill the pre–1700s requirement, but I would probably not recommend as an elective unless you are very passionate about the subject matter."

I wish we had slightly less reading each class because it is a lot, and sometimes people will come to class not having read, but she does such a good job of making class engaging that it doesn't matter much either way."

You will mature academically in the process of reading a lot of incredible writing by a Great American author. You will learn new vocabulary and will become a better reader. I feel more prepared to talk about the issue of race in America thanks to the emotional and intellectual development I underwent this semester.Of course, reading a book in one or two weeks requires time. Being a fast reader would be nice. I was not one of those, yet I had a good experience (it's just a staying on top of the schedule... I read one of the books before the semester began to get ahead). You've got to read the books to truly experience what the class has to offer. If you don't read them, you'll be lost. Reading shouldn't be an issue though since the books are so interesting. The assignments and grading are fair. Take this class to understand and come to know the great Toni Morrison!"

      "For context, I am a STEM concentrator who took this course as an elective. I had not previously taken any courses in the English department and had little to no prior knowledge of visionaries, though I consider myself an avid bookworm.This course was incredibly educational –– Professor Watson is immensely knowledgeable about the topics this course covers; I often felt as though I was given access to a treasure trove by being able to listen to him lecture. As much as students wanted to talk, he would let them talk, but it also seemed as though he had endless insightful comments to add to whatever conversation we were having. Much of the information he lectured to us at the beginning of class before discussion was very difficult to find online, meaning I was able to get so much more out of reading the works in his class than I would have reading them on my own.With that being said, I did sometimes have to put in a lot of extra effort to keep up with the discussion in class, primarily due to most of the class being significantly more familiar with the materials (either having read their works before, or having vast knowledge of the contexts around visionary writings). This wasn't a bad thing –– particularly if you do have prior knowledge since the conversation was very engaged and occurred at a relatively high level –– but, if you're someone like me who had little prior knowledge of the materials before enrolling, I would find time to talk to Professor Watson beforehand –– he is very down–to–earth and helpful, which made the readings and gap in understanding between myself and some of my peers much more manageable. Past just the course material, he helped me strengthen my writing in general and cared about his students at an individual level. If you find the material interesting and are willing to put in the time to do (most) of the readings, you won't regret taking this course (or really, any course with Professor Watson)."

      "I expected a lot more out of this course, and I think this goes for a lot of people as well. At a time when Taylor Swift is a HUGE topic of conversation (and Harvard is always considered to be pretty newsworthy), there is so much more that could have been done. Honestly, I think a lot of people only stayed in the class with the hope that Taylor would one day show up, but we didn't even get so much as Jack Antonoff. Sometimes we did get incredibly interesting guest speakers (one of my favorites was the costume designer that came during the last month or so), but these speakers were often only left with a rushed 15 minutes or so at the end of class. I think the general class consensus would have been that we would rather these speakers get most or all of the time when they came rather than the regular lectures that we sat through all the time. Sometimes the lecture topics were quite interesting, but most of the time, they were a lot to sit through. I think this class would have been better as less of the typical time spent listening to the professor lecturing and with far more time spent listening to experts from various backgrounds. The little bit of time we did get to spend listening to experts (like guest speakers and some of the very talented TFs) was definitely the most impactful use of our time, so I would have loved to see more of that. A Harvard course on Taylor Swift could have made so much more of a wide–scale statement on the impact of powerful women and the genius of Taylor Swift, but I think the professor's insistence on sticking directly within a certain \"comfort zone\" or running the course like a typical English course limited this opportunity significantly."

      "English 185 is a fantastic course for concentrator and non–concentrator alike. I personally am a joint CS and Math concentrator (but am doing an English secondary), so I feel that I can “see both sides of the veil,” if that makes sense. I have a few diffuse thoughts. First, the reading list in this class is absolutely excellent. You read a good dose of the “classics” (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of “modern picks” (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood’s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all–time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi). Second, Prof Wood is really quite an amazing lecturer. He has built a career doing “literary deconstructionism,” and so it’s a treat listening to him break open a piece. I do think the lectures near the end of term fall off, however; he has less to say about some of the packets of modern essays. Finally, a word on this class’s difficulty. It really isn’t a huge time sink, and you can skate by if you want to without doing much reading. However, the beauty of English 185 is that the readings are actually manageable—so you will get so much more intellectual richness out of this class IF YOU READ! Also, the workload outside of reading is fairly light; it’s just 2 essays. However, these are supposed to be good pieces (by the standards of an English concentrator, not by the standards of your gen–ed TF)—and that is a nontrivial task."

Professor Gates successfully embodied a seriousness about the course material while also being lighthearted and gracious in his approach to students, which made learning in his classroom a complete joy. This is not the style of William through whom weekly assignments are submitted. Professor Gates expressed grace and flexibility in class regarding the occasional delay in weekly responses, yet this was not shared by William who had a seemingly unprovoked outburst one week disproportionate to the offense when an outside commitment meant I was a day late in a response submission. Having never received a prior warning from him before (or any email response from him for that matter) I was taken aback by the tone in which he felt comfortable to speak to a student. It was the sort of exchange that would make me want to drop out of a class had I not been so far along in it, which is sad as prior to the interaction it was my most enjoyable course. Having been a TF myself, I was extremely concerned that any student be spoken to in this manner (as was the director of student support who I showed the email to in order to get advice as to how to handle it, I am writing this at her recommendation). I would like to give the benefit of the doubt as we all have off–weeks, however a few other students and auditors shared similarly uncomfortable exchanges with him which made me want to convey this on the evaluation form in the hope that it might be remedied for future students. This is my only criticism for an otherwise fantastic course."

But, even then, sometimes people just didn’t have much to say. It was, at time, quite difficult to see the theory we were reading as in dialogue with one another. I think this is just a limitation of a semester. The poems were really lovely. And Stephanie was wonderful to read them with. A highlight of the semester. Stephanie is a deeply eccentric and delightful instructor. I would imagine that she may not be everyone’s cup of tea and can easily be distracted. But I have rarely been more convinced of the sincerity of a professor and their personal investment in my wellbeing.

The final project was quite challenging (this year it was a 5–7 minute video) because I had never done something like that before, but I think it will be different next year so don't let that influence you. Really cool subject matter that is important to know, but the class in general could be more streamlined."

      "Overall, it was a good course, and I feel like I learned a lot about challenges with EVs in the US and worldwide at the end. The instructor was clearly knowledgeable and experienced about the subject, but it seemed she initially struggled to find an appropriate teaching style for undergraduates, especially after coming back from the corporate world. In fact, I personally found some of her responses/reactions to students in the first couple of classes quite questionable (cutting off when students were still speaking, etc.). Her teaching style has gradually improved, and the course felt more interactive and comfortable. Another thing is this course can easily get too technical. It might be a fit for some people, but I would note this as a reservation."

You really get into the specifics about certain rules and policies on the federal level, and Prof Jenks does a great job clarifying these sometimes really confusing histories and developments. It gets a little bit into the weeds of policy stuff that could def sometimes get a little abstracted/boring, but honestly its super important stuff to know, and I am surprised it took so long for this class to develop in a concentration literally called Environmental Science and Public Policy. As someone hoping to go into environmental policy or law, this will probably be one of the most foundational courses I have taken at Harvard that will actually have a direct positive impact on my career. Also attracts really great classmates that raise really good and interesting points/questions.And all of this with a pretty manageable workload. WHAT IS NOT TO LOVE!"

Moreover, the project where we got to create our own comic was a lot of fun, even if you're new to comics. I thought that this class was both a great way to look at Asian American graphic novels and to get more familiar with the visual language of comics. My concentration, English, lacks any classes about this literary medium so this one absolutely fulfilled that niche, and I was introduced to different kinds of theory this time as a result of the class being a part of the EMR department.

      "HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXPOS CLASS! Dr. B is seriously one of the best teachers I've ever had and honestly even had me excited about waking up for 9am Expos. She really does care about every student and facilitated a really nice + supportive class environment. I felt connected to my whole class by the end of the semester and honestly miss it—we definitely had inside jokes, but also really good conversations. I think that Dr. B works to make sure everyone feels heard in the class, which can lead to some precocious people dominating the conversation unfortunately, but especially if you are on the quieter side, I encourage you to speak up as much as you can. I definitely don't think that this is an easy A Expos—Dr. B is very knowledgable, in a way that definitely makes her picky about argumentation and structure. Still, I really think I learned a lot from this class. The material is really interesting and our readings covered a range of fields (social science, medicine, psychology, etc) which was cool. I think students who were already good at writing definitely thrived in this class, while as someone with a relatively untraditional background, I struggled a bit, so I cannot recommend starting EARLY and going to Dr. B with questions enough. She is very supportive and helpful, but deadlines creep up fast. Still, assignment prompts are pretty flexible and I really felt like Dr. B cared about each of us developing as a writer. Of all my friends, I think I had one of the best experiences in Expos. I will say that the Expos writing style (super short paragraphs), which is taught across the different courses, is a bit peculiar, so watch out for that. But TLDR Highly recommend!!!!!"

This course made me realize this is likely because I am interested in/enjoy anthropology. This course unexpectedly serves as an intro anthropology course, and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of their intended concentration. Doug is the most wholesome and sweet guy, but you definitely have to work for your grade.

Yet, I would still like to provide my takes on what I thought was a very ambiguous class. First, keep in mind that discussions on this topic were very contemporary as protests were literally happening while we were taking the class. Setting that aside, I really really really struggled to find a heterogenous flow of thought in the discussions themselves. It often seemed like everybody was in this bubble where anything other than what they thought would be seen as awfully implausible. This contributed to an overall homogenous discussion (as literally everybody agreed with each other), but I feel like it took away from the educational purpose of the seminar itself. It is unfortunate, but of course it doesn’t take away from the learning aspect of the class. It very much felt like an history class where debates were not really an option, which did help me learn a lot about activism at Harvard and beyond, but didn’t help me develop a stream of thought on why I could change my view. Overall, good class, but it definitely needs improvement if offered again."

The extended scholarship for this course was an additional group* project at the end of the year for which I only had to write 200 words, and that was balanced out by a shorter mini essay for the second required essay as opposed to a full 5+ page essay.  The group project was also something that we discussed and planned together in class over multiple days, so it was super low–stress and engaging.

For the final paper, you get to choose a conspiracy to research, so find one you're interested in so that you enjoy writing the paper.Professor Garcia is very supportive throughout the semester and is always happy to provide you feedback/answer questions as you work on your drafts and revisions. If you follow his feedback, you should do very well in the class. As with most Expos classes, the workload per week depends on if a draft/revision is due that week. If not, the homework should take no more than an hour. If so, you may be spending 10+ hours. Note that the turnaround from a paper being introduced to the draft being due is quite fast, so be sure to budget time for this (but don't worry to much about making your draft perfect, just get the gist of it down so that you get good feedback in your conferences). There's a good amount of time between the draft being due and the revision being due (2–3 weeks), so revisions tend to not be too stressful if you manage your time well.If you have any interest in conspiracy theories at all, you should take this class."

      "Look, it’s expos. It’s gonna expos. You’ll learn to write argumentative papers! Hooray! You’ll get great feedback on your writing, but you may not be writing about things that excite you. Dr. Given is, I think, a uniquely good writing prof. My reservations about this class are really just reservations about the writing program itself. The second half (or possibly last third) of the class was far less exciting than most of the actual content, largely because it felt like we were just slogging through the research and writing skills that the program wanted to throw at us.However, this class started very strong, and I think it’s likely one of the better options for expos. I found the first half really interesting–I hadn’t engaged much with art and its associated ethical questions much, and it was really cool to learn the whole language of discourse in this area. The case studies make everything very salient and are a good combination of more practical and theoretical readings, and classroom discussions were pretty good once everyone warmed up to it."

      "TAKE THIS CLASS AND PUT IT #1 ON YOUR LOTTERY. Dr. Gold is THE best, and your writing will improve immensely. This course is the perfect balance of being very manageable work–wise while still making sure you are learning A LOT.  You will have max 1 hour of reading per week, and the readings are actually interesting so it won't even feel like homework. This class only has 2 essays and a capstone project rather than 3 essays, which is amazing. While Dr. Gold is not the easiest grader, she offers great feedback so that you can definitely succeed in the course. Dr. Gold is the best professor ever, and she genuinely cares about every student and makes sure that we are all learning and improving. In–class discussions are extremely fun as well.

      "Definitely one of the best Expos classes. The content is really interesting if you're into feminism, and the course reviews a wide but also balanced variety of materials (short stories, theory, social media) that gives you a very holistic and well–informed view of feminism. The course probably improves your writing just like any other Expos class would, but I think what's especially nice about this class compared to other Expos classes (at least according to what I heard from my friends also taking Expos) is that Dr. Gold is really good at giving constructive feedback and advice that's very fitting to your questions. In that vein, she's also very accessible in terms of draft conferences and office hours. Her feedback allowed me to get past the early obstacles in my essay writing, which makes the essay writing process a lot easier overall – you can spend more time developing your arguments and mapping out your structure, rather than getting stuck on, say, formulating your thesis. Also, Dr. Gold is super lenient with deadlines – if something is due on Monday at 12am, it's actually due before she wakes up on Tuesday morning, so if you're a night owl, this is really helpful! That being said, I think you could also say that writing essays in this class is a little \"easier\" than in some other classes if you're interested in the topic. Theses are pretty easy to formulate since you're probably well–acquainted with a selection of feminism–related sources and pop culture, so essays can grow from your natural line of reasoning, whereas in more \"obscure\" Expos topics, it might be harder to do that, meaning you might spend more time on your essays. But also take this paragraph with a grain of salt, lol, just something I observed."

The most helpful part of the course was one–on–one conferences/office hours, as she is a great listener and it's super fun to bounce ideas back and forth and leave with a greater sense of direction for your writing.The content was quite interesting: there's such a wide array of fiction about the climate in multiple media, and this class does a great job of exposing you to these different forms of climate fiction and teaching you to think critically about themThis class has a decent workload – regular discussion posts on readings and multiple response papers per essay for the weeks you don't have drafts or revisions dueAlso, the first unit is on poetry analysis so be prepared for that The research paper was my favorite paper because you get to research any work of fiction you want and analyze it from a climate perspectiveWhile the class is a fair amount of work, Eliza is an amazing preceptor and your writing will improve immensely, so I would recommend this class!"

She is super friendly, makes class interesting, and is very available for advice in writing your papers. She is also a fair grader who understands the work you put into your paper. Expos really is what you put into it. If you take the time to really work on your paper over the course of a week, go to the Writing Center, check in with Dr. Lane at office hours, you will do well on your paper. Conversely, if you wait until 8 pm the night it's due to start, yeah things aren't going to go as well. On weeks where there were no papers due, I maybe spent 2 hours maximum on Expos – Dr. Lane is aware that we're all really stressed and busy so she doesn't load us down with work outside of papers, which is nice. Also, you get to watch movies instead of do homework! Of course, when papers were due that sucked up my entire week, like at least 20 hours if not 30. Overall, I had a lot of fun in this class (which I wasn't expecting for Expos). The discussions are very casual and interesting, and most of the kids in my section (including me) are STEM kids, so the atmosphere was quite chill and friendly. I highly recommend taking any Expos with Dr. Lane!"

I do admit that the supreme court cases were a bit confusing and difficult to read even as a social sciences/humanities concentrator, but the quality of the discussions in class and feedback you receive on your essays far outweigh any hardships you might face. Furthermore, the cases get better the more you read them. Ross is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. Even though expos is a very discussion heavy class, he makes sure to withhold his personal opinions and spark vibrant conversation around difficult topics like abortion and slavery. His feedback WILL improve your writing.  Furthermore, he is very insightful about you as a person and individualizes the conferences to match your ideas and style, as well as just being a very patient and considerate person in general. Taking this class will challenge you to both analyze and interrogate the words in front of you. You will learn how to be a better reader and writer. Most importantly, you will begin to question (if you haven't already) the foundation of the United States and what it means to be a person in the legal context. Please please please take this class.

Although most people who take this class are pre–law and interested in the humanities, there are a few STEM students every semester. I'm a STEM person and this was my first ever humanities course so I was struggling a lot at the beginning, but Dr. Martin offered me so much support. He is an amazing professor and is really there to help his students. Reach out to him for help, and check out the Writing Center; you will see yourself getting better and better as the semester goes on. Dr. Martin leaves a lot of feedback on papers, and it's very important to read those and implement them into your revision to grow as a writer and develop your arguments. The court cases we read are very interesting. I think the best part about this class is the in–class discussions. I have learned SO much from the diverse thoughts and perspectives of my peers, which makes taking this class an invaluable experience.

Throughout the semester, I learned a substantial amount of the sociology of work (a topic that I knew I was vaguely interested in) and my writing significantly improved. The assignments were sparse but meaningful, the class was not difficult, and the topic was engaging and applicable to the real world. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested in how society functions (and why) as well as STEM concentrators that do not want to analyze literature. At the same time, taking this course if you don't care about the content is a recipe for disaster. In the course itself, the feedback was always meaningful and relevant in a manner that significantly improved my writing. There was also always time for office hours or emailed questions. The sections would occasionally feel very long, especially towards the end of the course, however I believe that this feeling is a result of the expos model and not the course itself. The class readings were also INCREDIBLY reasonable. They are short, relevant, and assigned before any work is due. This is not true of many other expos classes. Finally, the class deadlines were clearly communicated and reasonable. There was always time to write, edit, meet with the professor, and procrastinate while still turning everything in on time."

This is a super STEM–oriented expos: all but one person in my section was concentrating in biology or chemistry. That means that you talk a lot about biotech and genetics, but in ways that I wasn't talking about those topics in my other bio/chem courses. The grading was super fair and I actually always enjoyed researching and writing my essays because the topic was so interesting. The final paper itself is also really open to interpretation, you can research anything you want that is in some way related to biotech, genetics, or mortality. I really loved our class discussions, the majority of section time is this so it's very low stress but interesting. Dr. Raymer is also the best!! She gives great feedback and is always willing to stick around after class or schedule a time to talk about any issues you're having with your papers. She's so sweet and was the most accommodating out of any of my professors with sick days. She genuinely really cares about her students and wants to help. There were some weeks with maybe like an hour or two of readings, but they were interesting and you don't have to read them all everytime. This class had a pretty light workload, other than the three weeks a paper was due. I wasn't expecting to get much out of expos in general, but some of the readings really make you think and are super applicable to how you view life, so I actually didn't mind all the readings. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this expos, especially if you're a stem major!"

At the end of the day, this is an expos class, and you do need to \"play the game a bit\" (aka learning what your preceptor likes and doing it in your essays, even if it is not really your style or you would rather write a different way). But that is simply the nature of Expos. That aside, Adam runs a great expos course. Take \"The Underworld\" if you are interested in Hell, Greek mythology, the classics, and anything along those lines. The course material is so so so interesting and fun, and the readings are not long. My advice: Take Adam's feedback seriously, he knows what he's talking about. A plus: he likes to have fun in class and keep things from getting stale."

Adam was a great preceptor and he facilitated discussions really well. I learned a lot from other people in the class because they all have very cool takes, and I improved a lot on my writing because Adam gave VERY detailed feedback and suggestions. The second essay and final paper were also interesting because I got to analyze the theme of underworld in two movies, Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away.

      "I was hesitant coming into this class as I had heard not–so–great reviews from the previous semester, but I believe Dr. Spencer had done some restructuring to the course because I enjoyed it quite a bit. The workload for this class was very reasonable for an Expos, as we read around 2–3 pieces of literature for each unit, and I liked that we dived in–depth into them rather than having a bunch of readings. The class atmosphere that was fostered was also great, as everyone was invested and thoughtful, and we had some great and interesting discussions. Dr. Spencer is also highly intelligent and well–versed in science fiction, and he did a great job of getting the discussion going in class. This Expos is definitely great for STEM people, because it really challenges you to think about science and tech from another perspective. One thing is that the feedback given on writing assignments were sometimes hard to decipher, which made it difficult to understand how to improve my overall writing as a lot of the feedback was more niche rather than broadly applicable feedback that be applied to all types of future writing. In addition, the class laid out the components of a good essay, but we didn't dive super deep into exactly how to write a good essay, so I wish that we had done some more investigating and work into that rather than just focusing on getting the final drafts done. I would say Dr. Spencer does also grade more harshly than other Expos professors, but in my opinion, he didn't grade unfairly. But overall, would definitely recommend taking this Expos!"

      "I think this course needs to be restructured. Each class period was either spent watching half of a film that we were to be writing about (which could have been done outside of class) or dissecting students' work. Most classes were the latter: we would sit and listen as Ms. Strauss analyzed each student's topic sentences or body paragraphs, painfully slowly, in front of the rest of the students. It seemed like our time could have been much better spent on other things, like revising our work or even writing our drafts, but instead we sat and listened to feedback that didn't apply to us and would have been much better as a private suggestion or canvas comment. I wish that we could have spent more time actually learning, eg. going deeper into film techniques or the history and context of the films we were watching, or engaging with more material about the definition of persona and its relevance. Also, the essay prompts were at the same time very vague and very specific, eg. \"you’ll enter into a scholarly conversation about the issue of persona, debating whether living and building relationships via persona leads to the ultimate gain or loss of the self. Is the construct of persona completely deceitful or could there be elements of authenticity and/or integrity that can forge personal growth and true connections with others? Might artificial constructs serve the individual, and, by extension, our greater community in constructive ways?\" In the above prompt, we are constrained to write about persona and its positive/negative impacts on the self. Or maybe on persona's impact on relationships? Or personal growth? Or the community? It was unclear if we were supposed to pick one of these prompts or somehow respond to all of the above questions (and it was implied in–class that we were meant to respond to all of the questions in the thesis alone). Finally, Ms. Strauss's grading often hinged on very strict formatting issues. Our thesis had to be the last sentence of our introduction, our introduction ought only to be one paragraph, etc. I understand that an expository writing course should introduce students to the structure of an analytical essay, but the concern about formatting constrained creativity and I feel that my writing is now more rigid and less tied together than when I began the course.It is HARD to get an A in this class. Ms. Strauss does not grade leniently, and the only assignments are the 3 essays (plus an annotated bibliography and participation points). There are no opportunities to raise your grade outside of the essays and Ms. Strauss will not allow additional help or conferences outside the single 15 minute conference for Essays 1 and 3 (to keep things fair among the students, because she doesn't have time to help everyone–––understandable, but it also aids to general stress around the large assignments). I personally feel that Expository Writing ought to be a safe space to raise your writing skills to college level, not a GPA stressor. And the fact that each class period was sharing your draft with the whole class and having Ms. Strauss critique it publicly led to a vibe of maybe not outright competition but certainly isolation. The class materials (especially the films provided) were very interesting, and I was grateful to watch famous and influential movies that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. But that's the only thing that I felt I got from this class.TLDR; we watch good movies but they are not worth the strict grading policy, BORING class periods, and isolating nature of the curriculum."

The readings can sometimes be a slog if you are not interested in deep theories of comedy, so make sure you like the course topics and don't mind getting a bit abstract with comedy and essay prompts.

The topic is extremely interesting, and I would heavily recommend this expos to someone who wants some exposure to philosophy. Some of our readings genuinely changed my outlook on how to live life. The papers were very interesting to formulate and write, but they were also time consuming. The comments on your rough draft and writers conference are EXTREMELY helpful in formulating a good argument that makes sense. Rob is an absolute gem. He makes class very intriguing and funny, and you can tell that he cares a lot about his students and the topic. He was easily my favorite professor from freshman year, and I genuinely looked forward to and enjoyed every single class (yes, even as a STEM major). However, Rob can sometimes let emails get buried in his inbox and return feedback late. He is very reasonable about it though –– when this happens, he gives extensions. He is also a harsh but fair grader. He expects a lot out of you, but that has made my writing improve a LOT over the course of this semester. You really need to focus on formulating a well–constructed argument and making sure that your sentences and writing language are up to standard. Overall, this was an amazing class and I am very glad I took it. It was time–consuming, but I would say that it's 100% worth the time. Also Rob is the best."

      "If you are debating between regular Expos 20 and Expos Studio 20 for your second semester of Expos (assuming you were in Expos Studio 10), take Expos Studio 20. The theme of 20 is 'The Successful Life.' For context, I am a student–veteran who did not attend a private school, nor am I a brilliant writer. FGLI and minority status would be used to describe myself. With that said, I am aware that my background has brought me to ideas of what success should look like or what would be nice, but are those ideas what you came to Harvard for? Or did you come to Harvard to train your mind to create change that not only benefits yourself but the greater community as a whole? I got closer to the answers of the above questions. They may never be solved, but the closer you get to solving them, the closer you will get to \"the good life\" (if you take the course, you'll see where that's from).In Unit 1, you will be exposed to various sources to think critically about while furthering your writing skills and vocabulary. This unit was beneficial. In my free time, I would think about how the sources could relate to my path and what I could learn from them to make the most of my time at Harvard. Throughout Unit 2, you will see another type of writing: research. You will bring several ideas from Unit 1 and add to this arsenal with more sources that connected with me and other students from similar backgrounds. It was a humbling experience to realize that many other students have experienced and are going through exactly what you may be. You will have a library session (this also occurs in regular 20) to learn how to conduct academic research, which was super helpful (shout out to Susan (Sue) Gilroy, librarian – she is the best and sweetest!). I did not realize how complex finding sources can be. You have a heavy dose of freedom to choose what you want to research with a few restrictions. You can then use many of the skills you've been training to sort through evidence and ideas to come to a conclusion that informs and educates your audience. I found this very helpful and relevant to what you may be exposed to here at Harvard. Take this course if you want to think deeply about your future and what you care about most. Professor Taleen Mardirossian has made a math concentrator love writing and sees value in what it offers to the world. She takes the time to work with you and your ideas while bringing many of her experiences and knowledge. She goes above and beyond to ensure her students' success and does this in a manner that is indicative of what a Harvard professor should be. Taleen created a safe environment for ideas and thoughts while being courteous to others. Often, I would even find myself laughing while learning. She makes this course what it is, and the writing department should hold onto her. I greatly respect Professor Mardirossian and would like to endorse her in all of her future endeavors at Harvard and beyond. Please take this course to learn from a legend! She should be the head of the writing department."

It is actually remarkable how self–transformative and self–reflective this course is, while also just being a fun course which I always looked forward to.

Through Expos40 I made 13 new, close friends I wouldn't have gotten to know otherwise. Also, this course helped me become a way better speaker. All the speeches and exercises were terrific at helping me practice, see, explore, and learn about \"good\" public speaking (I put good in quotes because it assumes that there is one way of doing public speaking well which is not necessarily true). Through expos40 I became better at telling stories and connecting with people. Expos40 uncovered a strength and passion of mine: speaking and talking to people. It also sparked a curiosity in me for comedy, theater and acting. This class does a tremendous job at helping you learn from your experience by having goal setting exercises and reflections along the way.The class is not overwhelming at all in terms of work but what you put in is what you make out of it. It is true fun! Kate (the professor) is the best! However, I have heard great things about other section leaders too so it is worth taking."

It's one of those rare classes at Harvard where you actually learn practical skills, and I think everyone could benefit from this, even if you aren't planning to be giving speeches regularly. I get super nervous about public speaking, and this was a super welcoming environment to challenge myself in.  There will be so many people in your section who are also really nervous about speaking, and you end up forming a really strong connection with your classmates. It's very light work–wise, and most of the time I spent outside of class on it was preparing for the four major speeches you give throughout the semester. In addition to those, there is also a fair amount of impromptu speaking in class. Nick was a super nice section leader, he kept us engaged for the two hours, and he gave good feedback on the speeches."

Now, I feel sooo comfortable in all of these situations. Terry does a lot of impromptu speaking exercises in class, and they are super fun but also the most helpful exercise in building confidence.

It is up to you how much you prepare for it.In hindsight, I think I should focus less on the material and on crafting the topic, but instead focusing on delivery and speech techniques. Start practicing the speech instead of keep editing your draft or slides: your end goal is to improve your public speaking anyways!I won't say it is a gem, because you meet 2 hours per class, 2 classes per week, so that is already 4 hours per week (outside of prep time). It might take time to craft the speech, and also there was a week with >100 pages of reading. However, grading is very low stress, so just put in as much as you want to get out of it.A strength of the course is that the class bonds quite tightly, so you get to know a certain selection of Harvard people that perhaps you might not necessarily come across. However, most of them will be seniors, so you might not meet them again. Regardless, it is very cool to get to know them deeply and listen to their speeches. Some speeches are really impressive that you will learn and perhaps incorporate some of their style in your speech. There are also speeches that can broaden your world view. Some are hilarious to sit through.There are some fun warm–up exercises reminiscent of summer camp activities like throwing small sandbags while walking in a circle and shouting out the alphabets. You don't get to do this in most other classes.The idea of our speeches being recorded and we get to privately review them afterwards is also pretty powerful.Take it! It is a fun class that really bonds and also a chance for you to develop your public speaking skills! You will get to see and learn quite a lot."

My public speaking didn't radically transform, but I got noticeably better and was far less nervous on stage by the end of the class.

The coursework is very light, consisting of some readings and a weekly pset. Each pset is graded for completion (obviously) and is very light – it is meant to review/explore a couple of basic questions, not to stress you out, and usually the necessary resources are given if you're seeing something new. The final was a short paper on any topic of our choice discussed in the class, which was very fun to write and low–stress. Fabio is an amazing TF and also truly a highlight of the class. He teaches about 45 minutes of each 2 hour class period and is so much fun to work with. All in all, this class is a really unique and interesting astronomy class that I highly recommend, whether or not you have any background in the subject. Furthermore, getting to have Avi as a teacher is an opportunity that you probably can't get anywhere else as an undergrad, so if you're at all interested, definitely take it.

The professor is amazing, kind, and gives very helpful feedback on all of the writing assignments we did throughout the semester.  The writing assignments were often in the form of op–eds (something that I didn't know until this course) which made them more fun to write and they often prompted you to consider your own feelings on a particular topic as it pertained to medicine, illness, or legalities.  I learned a lot this semester about different ways to consider readings as well as how to write my own.  The in–class discussions of the readings were always engaging, and everyone always had the opportunity to participate and provide their own insight.

It’s chill and the workload is light, and you still learn so much about art history and get to do fun, relevant hands–on projects too. I had a great experience in this class and would definitely recommend it, especially for people interested in history."

      "I really enjoyed this class!!! The seminars were super interesting, and I feel like I got a great survey of so many relevant topics/issues within the science/technology realms. The topics change a bit based on the year I believe, but some topics included COVID/vaccines, quantum technology (a major part of Hongkun's work), brain–machine interfaces, and many others. Hongkun was super awesome, which made the class amazing. He had so many cool stories and experiences to share (including with some very interesting people/politicians/business leaders) and is very funny, which was a really rewarding aspect of this seminar. We laughed a lot in this class. Also, go to Hongkun's office hours or out to meals (which we did a few times!) to talk about anything that's interesting to you – he's a great person to talk to. I took this class as a fifth class because I wanted to try a freshman seminar, was interested in the topic, and saw that the q guide was really really good, and I do not regret my decision at all. Not only was there very little work/stress for the class, but the seminar had a really great community, and I learned a lot. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

      "This was solidly the best physics course I took at Harvard. Every problem is very clearly intended and curated to actually make you think about the underlying content, and all of the lectures are clean, easily understandable, and well–organized. The content is extremely interesting and makes you interested in pursuing physics in the future if only to learn more about each of the topics, and while the problem sets are hard they're generally pretty short. Overall, I'd say that this is one of the best freshmen seminars for those who are genuinely interested in doing real–world physics. Also, if you're taking Physics 143A, the second half of 143 is basically covered in the first 4 lectures of the seminar, which is pretty helpful."

      "This is a wonderful class! Even if you are not a Folk&Myth concentrator (like me), this can be a wonderful way to get out of your comfort zone and try something new (or to fulfill your Divisional Distribution requirement).Pros:– Interesting content from which you learn a lot. I was interested in folklore before taking the class, but to me, this just meant folk songs and dances. This class delves much deeper into the field of ethnography and you get a totally new understanding of folklore through this prism. I feel I really learned a lot about the world in this class– Engaging class discussions. Be sure to do the readings so that you can meaningfully engage in the discussions (or at least understand what is being talked about). This class is rather discussion–based (not really a lecture style) so you really need to do the readings to learn and have a fun experience– Assignments are very fun to do and make you get out of your comfort zone. I had so much fun taking field notes and engaging with different places in Cambridge, events, and folk groups. I had a lot of fun attending a performance and engaging with my chosen folk group. I am really glad this class pushed me to have all those experiences – Deadlines are flexible. This saved me on many occasions. Sarah is very understanding and really tries to make the class as low–stress as possible– SARAH IS WONDERFUL!!! She put a lot of effort into the class and made it very interesting and engaging. She also has a lot of experience and is very knowledgeable on the subject. I was so interested whenever she entered a more lecture–like mode and shared her experiences and thoughts!Cons:– The has a heavy workload. There is a lot of reading and an assignment to do each week. These are all fun and interesting, but still, it takes a significant amount of time (perhaps especially if you are more of a STEM than a humanities person). However, I felt that all the work was insightful and needed. This is just a warning if anyone is looking for an easy elective. I would say that this will definitely be an amazing experience for everyone but you should have the heavy workload in mind"

I think that there was a little too much focus put on trying to develop an alternative story of Appalachia than the one that is commonly told and not enough focus on the things from that narrative that are accurate, but the content was still interesting and informative."

Total gem in the way where you can still learn a lot without spending too much time on it. Only assignments are relatively light (but super interesting!) readings and a takehome midterm and final that I found pretty fun.I came into this class extremely skeptical of the idea of post–truth, disinformation, etc., but now I'm more skeptical of the B.S. parts and less skeptical of the serious issues (in my view lol). And there is a lot of BS: at times the lectures can feel a bit theatrical. But those ones are at least still entertaining. The readings also give a lot of different perspectives, so you can really critically examine the issues. The only annoying part is the last few weeks of the class on intellectual virtues.

It was really not hard or time consuming at all*** Lectures were from 3–5pm which is like primary nap time for me (homeostatic sleep pressure was high, as you'll learn in the class), so being completely honest sometimes it was hard to stay awake. However, I always fought to stay awake because the lectures were sincerely so entertaining and informative (eat some Altoids mints). The professors have so many cool anecdotes about their lives, and everything you learn in that class somehow ties back to your own life. Section is very helpful too, as lectures are only once a week and it helps to really consolidate/review everything in the last lecture for the weekly quiz (super easy, 3 questions, don't sweat it). This was legitimately my favorite class I took this semester. I was originally on the fence about adding it to my schedule at all, but I'm so glad I did. I use the sleep principles that I learned so often, and I am now insufferable at telling people how to improve their sleep hygiene/random facts about sleep now.

It was really not hard or time consuming at all*** Lectures were from 3–5pm which is like primary nap time for me (homeostatic sleep pressure was high, as you'll learn in the class), so being completely honest sometimes it was hard to stay awake. However, I always fought to stay awake because the lectures were sincerely so entertaining and informative (eat some Altoids mints). The professors have so many cool anecdotes about their lives, and everything you learn in that class somehow ties back to your own life. Section is very helpful too, as lectures are only once a week and it helps to really consolidate/review everything in the last lecture for the weekly quiz (super easy, 3 questions, don't sweat it). This was legitimately my favorite class I took this semester. I was originally on the fence about adding it to my schedule at all, but I'm so glad I did. I use the sleep principles that I learned so often, and I am now insufferable at telling people how to improve their sleep hygiene/random facts about sleep now. I got a jeopardy question right because of this class, so you should definitely take it too."

However, my passion got the best of me and I went for it. I'm so glad I did: it's my favorite course I've ever taken here. There are few courses that make you noticeably smarter in just one semester. This is one of them. Ned successfully fostered a culture where people weren't afraid of failure, which is important given the difficulty of the puzzles. The intimidating syllabus self–selected a group of extremely intelligent students from every major who constantly had brilliant things to say in class. Ned's lectures are substantive and extremely interesting. You can tell that he and Ezra really care about making this class a unique and special experience, which they did successfully. It's the perfect balance of individual assignments, group projects, and full–class lectures. I wish I could take this class again. To anyone considering, you should take it. You will feel so accomplished by the end of the year, and you'll love the mental workout it provides."

      "You have to take this course. It's not a gem, you will do work whether it's the assignments, the creative portfolio, the take–home final or the engaged learning component – there are lots of assignments but they're small, meant for you to learn and improve and 100% doable. This course is 100% accessible to those who don't study the humanities if you buy in and want to learn more. This course is the definition of the more you put in, the more you get out. If you treat this course like oh I just need to get the assignments in or I won't do any readings you're doing yourself a serious disservice because the poems are fire, and the level of care and detail the teaching staff shows in each assignment is done because it allows you to grow – don't waste it! When we took the course you should read the syllabus and see but it's not all creative and instead you spend time responding to poems through writing assignments, making a podcast or writing a slide on a poem – don't worry you do get the chance to be creative in the portfolio but this isn't that kind of course where everything is creative.This course is exceptional and has the greatest level of care and growth opportunities from any course I've been in and that's because Professor Sandler and the TFs make such a big effort and are nothing short of legendary! Definitely one of my favorite courses at Harvard."

      "Honestly, take this class. It's very different from what you'd expect judging from just the title of the course, but no joke, it's the best Gen Ed I've taken here, and I firmly believe the Harvard experience would be so much better if all other Gen Eds were structured like this. No busy meaningless work; the few assignments we had were actually meant to help us engage with the course material, and didn't ask anything beyond that. Prof. Holland does an amazing, amazing job at showing just how messy, complicated, and central of a role scriptural invocation has played in American political life. I have no religious affiliation at all, and I found the course instruction to be incredibly even–handed, fair, and interesting to learn. Not only were the history lessons themselves actually cool and fascinating, Holland also does an incredible job in including and fleshing out overlooked histories of religion in American life, such as the Nation of Islam, queer hermeneutics, and many other niche topics you'd likely miss out on in a generic American history of religion course taught elsewhere. Also, Prof. Holland is a master of the English language; it's crazy how he answers student questions with such beautiful yet concise responses. He speaks exactly how a great author writes, and it blows my mind how he can come up with that language on the spot. The TF team was also goated this year; they're all incredibly sweet Div School grads who show up to class with their own rich understanding of the works we engage with. Mia Appelbaum was my section lead and she was awesome."

Labs in this class are fun and you get to use this software qGIS which allows you to make some really cool maps. Exams are fair but are worth a lot so having good study skills (this class is memorization, rather than problem–solving PSET based, so being good at memorizing is helpful) is important. Workload is very light outside of exam weeks where you would spend time reviewing. Prof. Meade is an engaging professor and he shares many anecdotes and cares about his students (he's the only professor I've had who shows up to exams :) ). 1 midterm exam worth 30% of grade, so make sure you're ready before spring break.  It is nice that this exam is typically offset from when other exams are... This year the exam conflicted with housing day though (unintentionally), so I would advise students to tell Prof. Meade about this early so he can change it if it accidentally happens again.Also, this class takes student advice seriously and the course has had many changes over the year because of qGuide scores. So that is really a testament to Prof. Meade's interest as a teacher to help out students."

There is truly something for everyone in the content of this course –– the historical context, potential social or political intent, and aesthetic decisions of each work were discussed in great detail, and we talked about art from a range of time periods and geographic regions! I had always enjoyed going to museums, but I started going to the Harvard Art Museums for brief visits for fun this semester, and am eager to explore more museums in the Boston area next semester. It's just fun to be able to recognize some patterns, have a sense of what different artists' inspirations might have been, and notice aspects of paintings (or sculptures, or exhibitions) that might not have been as attention–grabbing prior to taking this course.Finally, I would recommend either taking this course with friends, or making an effort to meet other students to make a study group! Particularly when the midterm and final rolled around, having discussions with friends and studying together just made all of the content much more memorable and interesting.Also, for what it's worth, I am a physics concentrator, and I had never taken an art or art history course prior to this semester :)"

      "The readings in the course were quite fantastic. Granted, there were many, but you did not have to do all of them to get the gist, and if you choose well, you'll get some interesting takes. Again, you don't have to do all of them! Also, professor Beckert is great. Super enthusiastic about the material and begins every lecture with a song. Great guy! Genuinely interested in student's thoughts/questions. That being said, you learn so much about American capitalism. We covered the entire history of its development in the US since colonization began in 1492. You will learn some cool things and I guarantee there's a little something in it for everyone. I would recommend this course with reservations though because it is very history heavy and very focused on the economy (granted given the name), so if it's not something you're devoted to learning it can get boring pretty quickly. In general, there were some not very interesting days. Also, there are many deliverables (including weekly reading summaries, and end of lecture reflections), butt you get used to it. If you want a chill class, probs not this one though."

      "I have such mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, the course staff is incredible. Professor Harris is thoughtful, in–touch with student experiences, and entertaining in lecture. My TF was also very on–top of things, responsive, and helpful in section. The material is absolutely fascinating. You cover readings from literally centuries ago up to the present, yet everything you read feels relevant and personal. The discussions in section with students were eye–opening and inspiring.At the same time, although this was my first GenEd, I still don't think it is anything like other GenEd classes. This class has only been a GenEd for a few years, so I think the difficulty is a remnant of when it was a small, department class, not a GenEd with over a hundred students. The course design was very thoroughly thought–out, which I appreciated, yet I found the design incredibly frustrating. If you want to fully participate in the course, it requires hours of reading (often ~100 pages per class) and at least half an hour of video lectures before ever stepping into the classroom. The in–person lectures were primarily answering student questions. I personally struggled with the flipped–classroom style––I'm way more likely to learn something when I'm sitting in a class than when I'm trying to watch a video in my free time. Many students hardly ever showed up to the in–person lectures. Additionally, the essays (which are the main assignments in the course) were anonymously graded––fair in theory, but it meant I got minimal feedback and wasn't able to talk to the person who had actually read my essay.A few things I wish I could tell my past self: –   Take the class pass–fail. You will be able to enjoy the content without stressing over B's on the essays. I understand that a B is a respectable grade, but I gave real effort on my writing and just didn't have the bandwidth to spend more time on this course. I gave these essays more energy than I ever did for an expos essay, for example, and still got worse grades than I have in any other course. I'm frustrated that this GenEd will likely bring down my GPA. I know that's not what's important here, but I still care about it and I'm guessing you do too. –   This course is better if you have prior philosophy experience. There is very little guidance or support if you are new to reading philosophy––and believe me, it is hard to do for the first time. Similarly, there is very little support for actually crafting an argument for your essays (the course staff basically refused to give examples of what a thesis might sound like or how a student might construct a philosophical argument). My TF and Professor Harris were happy to give feedback on my drafts (and very kind to do so), but I felt alone in figuring out where to begin. The essays also require you to think in a way that isn't really addressed in the course itself. The lectures, videos, and sections are focused on understanding the views of one philosopher at a time, and almost no time is spend discussing critiques or shortcomings of a philosopher. Then, the essays ask you to find flaws and compare different philosophers, which I found very challenging and new.  –   Be honest with yourself about the impact of this material on you personally. I think a lot of students are interested in this course because they are themselves religious or because they have left religion and want to think deeply about it. I know this sounds kind of silly, but I came into this course hoping it would be valuable during a very unstable spiritual period of my life, and it put me through the wringer emotionally. I left more existential than I came in, and although I thought I wanted that, it was so overwhelming and debilitating at times. I don't think this course would help someone figure out what they do or don't believe. On the last day of class, Professor Harris' send–off was simply \"I hope you leave feeling confused.\" So. Take that as you will.I know I've been pretty harsh here, and I'm sorry for the essay. I think this course has so much potential, and for many of the philosophy–minded students, I'm sure it was a very positive experience. Professor Harris has so much wisdom to share, it's a great way to read a lot of philosophy if you've been looking for an excuse, and you'll meet a lot of awesome students with really interesting perspectives on religion and morally. You'll have fascinating discussions in sections and learn a lot of different, valid ways of approaching similar moral challenges. That said, I cried SO MUCH over this course and I'm not sure the perspective I gained was worth having my GenEd be the most energetically–demanding class in my semester."

I was a little nervous going in since this class was ranked on the lower side of Geneds last year, but it is definitely a good class––not a slam–dunk 5–star class but definitely solid. All of the writing assessments are purely fact–driven, so that means you need to pay close attention and take good notes in lecture, but there is literally 0 analysis required and good notes should make the midterm assignments easy. I also wrote the final paper in less than 48 hours so don't stress about that either. With regard to content, I found the archaeology component of this class particularly interesting, especially when we got to touch and explore artifacts in the museum. It was also great to try Mexican foods throughout the semester, especially when I didn't hav enough time to eat lunch:) The lectures are REALLY BORING, but if you can put up with that for 2 hours a week, I would recommend it."

      "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Blum and all the TF's are incredibly smart and generally amazing – they have so much to offer and so many stories to tell! I particularly enjoyed throughout the class when Prof. Blum would connect our content to memories she had from her childhood. At one point, we were talking about \"cosmic insignificance\" and she talked about a memory she had from her childhood where she thought \"I'm completely alone in this\" – it made me feel so seen!! You also have to meet with her for a 15–min meeting once throughout the semester  so she can get to know you a little bit. I think all of these aspects make the class feel much better since you feel so connected to her/she knows your name/you feel more at ease with volunteering your answers in class. The class itself also has a very welcoming environment and you should definitely volunteer/answer the questions that Prof Blum poses to get the most out of the class (it's also completely OK if you don't but still) – it's very low stakes and there are so many interesting people taking the class (at least when I took it) with whom you can have discussions with – it's what Harvard is all about!! The guest speakers are also people with incredible insights, and the readings are very well–connected to lecture content. There's also a good general structure/flow to the class, it begins with more ancient philosophical readings from Stoicism/Epucureanism etc. and then progresses all the way up to Freud and ChatGPT. I wouldn't say this class is an absolute GEM since attendance is required, there's a reading check every class, there's a no–tech policy and there's also a \"capstone\" assignment you have to complete throughout the semester, but if you do the readings (or even skim them in some instances) it becomes very easy! And I grew to enjoy the no–tech policy a lot, I even started looking forward to class bc of the fact that my mind would get a break. I wouldn't say I spent any more than 2 hrs per week outside of class with the readings and assignments even on the week of the midterm and I got A's from almost everything. Overall, I would recommend EVERYONE to take this class – it truly WILL change your perception on many ways people have dealt with their anxieties and shows you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Everyone is, was, and will be feeling some type of anxiety – it's the human experience. And it's crucial to talk about it. This is what this class does."

I would describe it as more of a \"workshop\" class than a formal lecture class, in that it allowed students the opportunity to try out generative AI (through a ChatGPT 4.0 subscription!) for themselves on a wide range of uses. The content itself is broad and very introductory–level; this is great for developing a more thorough perspective on the potential, promises, and perils of AI—less so for developing an intensive technical background (probably should take a CS class for that, lol). That being said, the course still presents a useful survey of the underlying technology for those with less familiarity. The course assignments are minimal, with a few readings each week. The majority of class is participation–based and encourages showing up to lectures. There is a midterm paper, a final project, and a final exam BUT the midterm paper can be written with the assistance of ChatGPT, and the final project is open–ended, encouraging creativity. Lastly, the section is so much fun—our TF Elie was a legend (and French). The sections involve further hands–on experimentation with generative AI, highlighting both use cases and limitations. Ultimately, this class encourages some interesting discussions surrounding the nature of this (potentially) transformative technology and presents a wide range of viewpoints through different course materials and a diverse array of guest speakers from many different areas of Harvard.This review was not written by generative AI... :D"

      "This class is a great overview of some of the biggest questions surrounding K–12 education, including who the major decisionmakers are,  what \"good\" teaching looks like, and whether systems like tracking are effective. Readings on the syllabus may look daunting, but Liz's weekly prep guides trimmed the material to a very manageable length. It will certainly challenges your preconceptions about schooling, and as long as you are willing to come in with an open mind, you can take a lot away while engaging in friendly debate. The teaching team and assignments were certainly the highlight of this course for me. The TFs were incredibly passionate about their work and receptive to student feedback, which made my time in the course so much more enjoyable. Pennie in particular was absolutely phenomenal, and someone who made learning an absolute blast. Her emphasis on each student's well–being was truly unmatched. I also don't think this course could have picked a better array of assignments––a reflective essay on our K–12 journeys, a teacher interview, and a final project on a topic of choice––which gave me a lot of agency. The class is quite large at around 100 students, and while that leaves a lot of room to learn from your peers, it also makes for whole–group discussions that sometimes feel unproductive. Note that this is a nearly three–hour course, but it meets once a week, and––for better or worse––the time is not made up entirely of lectures. Depending on your attitude towards \"get up and move around\" style activities, you may find yourself enjoying the class sessions to varying degrees. Ultimately, given the thought–provoking material and supportive backbone of this course, I would highly recommend it."

Every email starts with ~Dear Wonderers~. The homeworks were basically fill in the blanks, they were fully completion–based, and there were only 5 of them. Besides that, there's only a final project worth like 10%. And, on top of this, there's extra credit available too! The once a week lectures were an interesting walk through many disparate topics in science. This class would have ran wonderfully if people actually cared about the material and paid attention. But, it's a gened after all, and if people aren't held accountable for knowing the material for homeworks or exams, no one pays attention. This is my critique of the whole gened system (that no one ever cares about actually learning in them, just doing the minimal amount of work). I think this class has so much potential, if taught to an enthusiastic set of students, to be a place for so much creativity and learning. The class is quirky, interesting, and has a great course staff, but I think it would be better as a seminar than a gened."

Here's a list of pros and cons for the course.PROS:Chaudoin is extremely engaging as a lecturer and super passionate about the material.The material straight up is not difficult. There's an entire section of a lesson dedicated to reading a regression table and determining whether the result was statistically significant. Other lessons are about basic game theory (stag hunt, PD), the bargaining model of war, etc. The tests were not super difficult. The averages were always around 90. Each test question / assignment is graded by the same TF, so grades are usually pretty fair. Katie is awesome. So friendly, responsive, and passionate about the material. Seriously made this class 100x better. CONS:The assignments did seem to be graded kind of harshly (but feedback was pretty good). Chaudoin sort of has a high school teacher mentality sometimes where he calls people out for not paying attention in lecture or not doing the readings. While I understand this must be frustrating as a professor, this is college and I sort of assume that lecture time is my choice to do with as I want (as long as I don't disrupt others). I then suffer the consequences of not paying attention. Chaudoin would often call people out and embarrass them for not paying attention to lecture, which I thought was unnecessary and uncomfortable. For reference, I never was one of the students who were put on the hot seat for this. The cutoff for an A this year was quite harsh at 95% (although nobody got below a B–, and most got either A's or A–'s). The Pick a War Assignment. You'd think group projects would be better at Harvard. Nope.Overall, great teaching staff, great content, great class. I'd definitely take it if you're a Gov concentrator."

Don't get me wrong, the material was challenging and complex, but I found the class super interesting. This class actually made me reconsider what I wanted to study because I loved the topics/possibilities in this area. Naijia, Jeremiah, and the course assistants were beyond helpful and dedicated to making sure you have the tools to understanding the concepts and succeed. The course staff definitely made the class great. The problem sets were difficult for me, but I was able to complete them by going to office hours and collaborating with peers. One thing to note is that the distribution of work is not very consistent: some weeks I would do 0 work and other weeks (like when we had a problem set, exam, or project) I would do many hours of work. However, the work is very manageable *especially if you go to office hours*. I also found the final project very interesting, though it was a bit difficult to apply what we learned. Although I don't feel like I have a super strong grasp of R, exposure to coding in R will surely be beneficial if I ever need to use statistical coding again (which I likely will because this class helped me realize that I want to pursue more quantitative social science or related field). HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you have any interest in applied statistics or working with data (even if you're not a Gov concentrator – I am not)."

      "This course was helpful for advancing my thesis and for that reason and that reason alone, I would take it again. This course forced me to regularly think about my thesis and also helped me understand how to apply for grant funding and obtain IRB approval. That said, this course was one of the worst I have taken at Harvard. The assignments were poorly organized, essentially busywork, and graded on such a massive delay as to be essentially unhelpful in their feedback most of the time. For example, the reading response assignments were about application readings that were almost all about eastern europe (not even close to my area of gov) so it felt difficult and unhelpful for me to write all of the critiques about these papers. The first paper I wrote during one of the first weeks of the class still hadn't been graded as of reading period, so I wasn't able to implement feedback from it in order to improve later papers. Regarding the project papers, the guidelines were so incredibly vague that the assignments became extremely frustrating. And the fact that they weren't graded cummulatively meant that myself and many of my classmates were constantly instructed to repeat ourselves in these papers and a lot of the feedback I got was asking for information that I had included in previous papers but had not had the word count to repeat in the following papers. It was unclear what the TFs and professors would be looking for in these papers and I was often given conflicting information from TFs and professors as to what they wanted me to prioritize. At some points they even disagreed quite vehemently about the feedback I was eventually given. The actual class time was also pretty unhelpful. It felt like we just repeatedly did the same TF–led activities week after week (building research plans for topics or questions) but at least myself and my table group entered the class at the beginning of the semester already having a strong grasp of how to do this so I don't feel that we gained much from it and we had more and more trouble buying into the activities as the semester went on. It just felt like a weekly waste of time. The most helpful moments of the class were when we would get into discussions that were essentially just Q&A sessions for advice on how to best implement a specific method, but these discussions were often cut off by the professor in order to \"get us back on track\" to the activities the TFs had planned that were not particularly helpful. In general, the whole class just felt very disorganized and like it had too many useless assignments. I'm not sure exactly what the solution is, but the class needs to be restructured somehow. Perhaps moving the lecture back to be during the actual class period would be a start, as it did not seem like \"flipping\" the class was worth it for the activities we did during the class period. It would have been much nicer to have the chance to ask advice style questions about each method and the ability to ask questions during the lecture."

It could be organized a bit better (but that's natural for a course being taught for the first time) and taught  in more of a \"code–along\" way instead of just scrolling through pre–written code, but with the recorded lectures it got easier to understand as the semester went on. The problem sets could also use more scaffolding and office hour work sessions, but Connor was super helpful thoughout the semester. If this course is offered at Harvard again (I really hope it is because this is one of the most critical things to learn if one wants to pursue quantitative gov academia or thesis research) I hope it can be organized slightly better. That said, even in its current form, I still learned a LOT this semester and count it among the most useful courses I've taken at Harvard. The course atmosphere was also nice."

She's very helpful in guiding us through both new content and new skills, and she's very understanding of all levels of experience with the kind of content we engage with.  The class is also divided really neatly into both interpreting research and understanding how to go about creating our own research designs.  The topics are really relevant and important, and you really feel like you're taking a lot away from the things you're reading.  I love this class and would happily recommend it to those interested!"

Professor Malik is great –– She wants her students to better understand literature, how to read and critique/dissect literature and learn about research methods. The course has a decent amount of readings but nothing too overwhelming as long as you read them each week. The amount of assignments given is manageable. Had a few smaller papers, a final research paper, and two discussion posts per week on the readings. Overall, I looked forward to this class. As a junior, the class was a great foundation for my senior thesis as I had an interest in a topic relating to ethnicity."

There aren't many other things like it at Harvard –– it's a great academic community where everyone is very engaged.

The course itself is fascinating (and accessible even if you're not a phil major – lots of people are gov/social studies). The seminar is also very well–run –– assignments & group meetings encourage you to get the most out of each week's readings, and the course's final essay is structured in a way that doesn't conflict with other end–of–semester work. Prof. Applbaum and Bethany are great –– they're knowledgable, fun to talk with, and want to see you succeed. Take this course if you want to have lots of interesting philosophical discussions & join an engaged, tight–knit academic community :)"

Professor Wang hand–picked some of the most interesting and popular readings from political science and organized them chronologically from the very earliest forms of government to modern–day politics. The readings consistently played off of each other and led to great class discussions. I learned so much and now feel confident in my ability to think and talk about international political development, and read more papers in political science.

Keeping up with each of the readings is more than possible, and she uses fun reading competitions on Poll everywhere to check for understanding of those readings. The class has roughly six response memos, due every other week and 3–4 pages each, asking you to connect the memoirs you read to the internal or external metric that the memoirs are associated with. Additionally, it has a final paper, 12–15 pages, where you evaluate the success of a chosen movement based on the semester's worth of learning. However, there are pre–submissions built into the course to give you feedback and make sure you are on the right track for the big paper at the end of the semester. for those who need any kind of accommodations, the teaching staff are incredible at making sure you have what you need, and as long as you communicate ahead of time, professor Hummel is extremely proactive in making sure that you are taken care of. Finally, the course staff is super understanding and flexible, providing a 48 hour extension bank that you can distribute as you please throughout the semester for every assignment except the final one.

If you're looking for a gem, this is not it, and if you're trying to preserve a 4.0/desperately want a high GPA this course might not be the one to take. THAT SAID this class genuinely changed my entire perspective relating to democracy and Latin America and I loved every minute of Professor Levitsky's lectures, which were SO invigorating and he was obviously so passionate about the material. The TFs in this course are the best TFs I've experienced while at Harvard. This class made me love government and poli sci and honestly has even affected my ideas for my future career paths to be more oriented in this direction. Genuinely I never write this much about any class, but if you're interested at all in Latin America or comparative gov, TAKE THIS CLASS.

      "This course is an interesting one. The first weeks are spent learning theory about how and why organizations function. Specifically, students examine Weberian theories of bureaucracy, theories of organizations which stress bounded rationality (i.e. behavioral), among others. The next weeks of the course are spent on the military. This is an administrative history of the army since the early 1900s, so if you're interested in learning about the laws which have constructed the modern military, this will be fruitful for you. The class is heavily weighted toward this module, and is full of ROTC kids and students interested in the military. Prof. Carpenter also invites several guest lecturers who are informative and engaging. The next weeks of the course focus on the FDA, using Carpenter's 700 page book as its reading and starting point for discussion. Like the army, this is an administrative history—so, while dry—it's interesting to see how the actual sausage gets made in terms of regulations and rulemaking. The course concludes with a survey of the Federal Reserve and financial regulation. My one qualm was with the section component of the class. Angelo, the TF, is clearly really smart, but does not manage section time well, and often rushes to cram half the content into the last three minutes of section. Moreover, the prompts were terribly designed (unclear if this is an Angelo or a Prof. Carpenter problem), and the expectations for essays felt terribly communicated. To quote one senior: \"the essays in this class were more complicated than my thesis.\" Despite my qualms about the papers, this course is interesting not only for the administrative history and organizational theory, but also for the tidbits of history you learn along the way; lectures sometimes digress into discussions of the finer points of the 2008 financial crisis or Operation Desert Storm. Prof. Carpenter is a wonderful lecturer and I feel like I left this course with a great amount of information not only about bureaucracy but also about how the world in general works. I would recommend for those who care about figuring out how the government actually works."

      "This is likely one of the hardest gov classes one can take. The professor is awesome and the material is interesting, but the grading structure means A LOT rides on the final essay and test. They are literally all that matters. The final was insane –– it's ~50 questions pulling from random lectures and information you're supposed to know (like asking for examples of concepts from outside of class). It's graded very nicely, but it is still much more difficult than the typical essay exam that accompanies a majority of classes in the department. Additionally, there are only two large writing assignments, which makes it hard to gauge whether or not your final essay is good enough to get the grade you desire because you're operating with limited feedback.That being said, I feel like I gained a lot from this class, and my understanding of US Foreign Policy has dramatically changed. Professor Friedman was great, nice, and incredibly insightful, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Just know that if you only want the credit, there's probably easier classes that get you the same thing."

You will get from this course what you put in, so I definitely recommend really trying to think about the readings deeply and engaging with them. One note: If you're very interested in talking about abortion or birth control in terms of *contemporary* debates, this is not necessarily what you're looking for––we only spend two weeks on abortion and all of these topics are very much approached through the lenses of capitalism, colonialism, etc. However, doing that is quite interesting, and Professor Suri is so kind and interesting to talk to as well!"

There was a good pace and structure to help us navigate the course, and Professor Kumekawa is really accessible. It also gave me the freedom and space to explore an aspect of the strange amorphous concept of \"offshore\" –– the assignments were scaffolded well to facilitate that exploration. It also changed the way I approached history; the global nature of the categorical approach to \"offshore\" helped me realise the intersections of history rather than to see them as silos. All in all, a great history class for both someone deeply interested in the area, and for someone who would like to just get a taster of what studying history is like."

You have to do the readings and actually participate in the discussions, and the final research paper must \"contribute to knowledge with a capital K.\" This can be a bit intimidating, but it made this course one of my favorites that I've ever taken at Harvard because it really pushed me to do my best work and I got a lot more out of this course than I have from a lot of other courses I've taken. Prof. Manela is really great and really nice and the class atmosphere was wonderful. Definitely take if you get the opportunity, but make sure you start the research paper early in the semester instead of waiting until you're in the middle of midterms.

The benefit of Intellectual History specifically is that the topic of intellectualism is really broad, so you can basically study whatever you want and you don't need to fight with course staff over whether your topic counts as \"intellectual\" history. The worst part of this class in my year was the other students. This is the sort of class that attracts people from other departments who are just here because they saw \"Intellectual\" in the title and want to feel smart. Lots of \"the epistemology of the philology of the chronology of scientology\" people, which can be hard to stomach. HOWEVER, the teaching staff are all delightful, and you have a ton of freedom with the papers which is matched with lots of support. I've grown a lot in this course."

Maya Jasanoff is a fantastic professor, incredibly knowledgeable and quite possibly one of the best professors that I've gotten the chance to learn from. She's very passionate about sharing everything she knows. The TAs were all very kind, patient, and helpful as well. The level of detailed feedback we would get on our papers from our assigned TA was ridiculous, I think nearly every sentence had feedback and this is even if you got a solid grade on the paper. In total there were three mini papers and one final paper. It seemed like a big task to complete so many papers at first, but I found the mini–papers to be extremely helpful in the end: each mini–paper helped guide our final paper which was essentially a topic of our choice. Overall I'd recommend this course 100% if you are looking for one of the best HIST sophomore tutorials to take. It won't be an easy class, but I think every HIST sophomore tutorial has very similar workload, so I wouldn't worry about that. I think that the selling point for this tutorial is the professors and TAs for sure."

She is brilliant, razor–sharp, one of the most engaging lecturers I've ever heard, and also extremely warm, kind, and funny. She alone is a reason to take this course. Additionally, you are better off as a historian when you take this course since you really get at the heart of what it means to sift through competing narratives and make historical arguments. I didn't realize this until I was done with the course, but it is remarkable. The material is of course very interesting too — and the readings are not lengthy at all, which makes it easier to engage. You will also be cold–called! That can be scary as an FAS student, but honestly it helped me focus more and I got more out of the classes where I was prepared to be cold–called than the ones I wasn't.HIST 1219 was an overall delight.

Professor Chalhoub is a treasure trove of knowledge about Brazil, and as someone who has taken numerous courses with him, I can't recommend his classes enough. They are often small and tight–knit, which means there are endless opportunities to learn from him. He is also very accessible outside of class and understanding of students' personal circumstances, which sets him apart from many other professors I have had in the past.

As the first course offered on oral history in the department, Professor Katie Holmes did such a wonderful job of bringing graduate and undergraduate students together for a critical inquiry into the field of oral history. Throughout the term, we put theory into practice. First, we interviewed one another. Then, we went off and interviewed a member of the public. I was able to produce primary sources that will help in my future research, and I am so inspired by the power of oral history to fill the scholarly gaps which exist in history and many other humanities disciplines. By centering working–class, Indigenous, and marginalized communities, I have learned so much about how to be a good oral historian and how to be critical and reflective of my own work. This course was abundant and is the start of a long journey. All thanks to Professor Holmes who is one of the best historians I have ever met. She truly cares about each student's research and she poured her support into each of us. I have rarely had an educator so invested in my personal research goals and interests."

The content is fun and Professor Estrin is a great lecturer which makes you want to attend lecture rather than it feeling like a requirement. Eli is also great and you should definitely try to attend both of their office hours! The workload is pretty light (however if you are new to art history, the first writing assignment might seem a bit daunting/the expectations might be a bit unclear, but after that you should have a pretty good idea of what is expected for the rest of the assignments) for most weeks (30 minutes – 1hr), and during the weeks with assignments (2 visual analyses and a midterm/final) the visual analyses might take 4–8 hrs each and prep for the midterm/final might take 2–4 hrs.

      "Don't take this course unless a lot of things change. The theme: unclear, unfair, and changing expectations. I am a STEM concentrator who took this course as an elective and had the following issues with it: the expectations were unclear, the teaching style was all lecture, it was not an intro level course in some respects but too much in others, and the assignments were both too much and unclear in expectation. I love art and Italian culture, but this course lost all of the wonder. Yes, you can work hard and probably do well. But in the last few days of the course (during reading period) they told us it would be curved down and that only a few As would be given out. Had I know this, I would NOT have taken this course. I know it is not good to only want an A, but as a STEM concentrator I wanted exposure to new topics while having the ability to do well. I know only the HAA concentrators will be able to get As due to this. There were issues like this at every step of the course that must be addressed in order to make it better. Here are the issues:The exams were not clearly laid out until right before they occurred. The final format was only told to us five days before the exam (during reading period!), which was not helpful for preparation or stress levels. The essays also had unclear goals except at the end for the last essay when a rubric was finally provided. Examples of how to write a formal analysis would be great, as the reading was helpful but as someone who studies STEM and had never interacted with any content like this at all was incredibly confusing with expectations. The slide tests were unpredictable in timing and led to a lot more stress and time spent on this course than I think was needed. Setting dates for them would be helpful for learning and reducing stress. The slide tests were said to be given at the start of class but never were. This led to everyone being stressed throughout the class until the last fifteen minutes. This is incredibly unconducive to learning and attention and needs to be addressed. There were many assignments in this course that it felt like too much for an intro class (three essays, two exams, 4 slide tests, many readings that had to be done)The reliance on blank lecture slides and writing down everything said by the professor did not seem like the best way to engage with the works, even though there is a lot of information I wish this class was taught in a small non lecture or less lecture format with use of newer and more effective learning strategies. The TFs provided short comments on the essays that were helpful but I would have loved more feedback as someone who has not written an essay in college in a long time. The feedback on what counts as a \"fact\" on a slide test was also constantly changing and unclear, which was not in line with learning and preparing well for them or the class. This was advertised as an intro course but it did not feel that way. I am a STEM concentrator with little introduction to classical literature and art, important art historians, or religious background. None of these were well explained for a person without the knowledge. Especially with the religious stories, we were expected to know and understand the saints and other things that I did not, making it hard to see the symbols in the works. I think more focus on teaching to a student who has no background would be great, or removing the word intro in the title and making it for HAA concentrators!This course taught me the things I memorized while studying for exams, but I lost a lot of the wonder for the art and the process along the way as a function of the layout of the course.The sunlight is the TFs. They were so nice and tried to make the best of it, but still the course was not great overall."

      "If you have the chance, TAKE THIS CLASS!!! As someone who had always been interested in how Japan had such a distinct visual culture, this course answered so many questions. But beyond that, it made me realize how so much of modern art in the world was influenced by this dialogue and exchange between eastern and western cultures. Lippit gives the best lectures, and the sections are super cool because you get to look at these famous prints in person. Looking at it from a broader perspective, I think this course is great if you want to explore a new avenue of aesthetic appreciation. I definitely look at most art in a different way now – after studying processes, the development of techniques, and the plethora of influences that can be seen through visual media."

      "First: I had taken other HAA courses before taking this one, so I was originally afraid the material in this course would be repetitive. That was certainly not the case: each week, a professor (one who was literally leading their subfield/region in art history) would come and give us an off–the–record take on their selected objects/concepts, which meant that sometimes we were listening to work they hadn't published yet, and other times we got to hear their reflections on their previous scholarship –– things they agreed with, things they would change. It was super refreshing to step out of my art history comfortzones, if only for a week at a time, and to read across all mediums, time periods, and regions. So take this course for a solid introduction to art history, one that exposes you to the perspectives of the fields from the people who started/advanced/defined them.The only complaint I have about this class is that the level of academic engagement with this opportunity and the materials was highly variable. Out of the 15 students in the class, maybe 4 would be actively engaged in each discussion, and because of this sometimes it felt hard to be part of a larger class community. Of course, this vibe will change with each cohort, so take this comment as you will.Moreover, if (part of) the role of the art historian is to write art in a way that expands how you view it, then Kirsten has done an immaculate job of showing us how to do so. Each week Kirsten would offer us some of the most eloquent, beautiful, and well–connected thoughts on the art concepts we had been introduced to in discussoin. And, I kid you not, I would actively refresh the course Canvas page each weekend for her comments on my response papers to appear, because I knew she would always say something that would make me rethink my takes on a particular art historical concept or extend my visual analysis more incisively into the materiality, historical significance, or tradition of a medium/era. On a personal note, she also sent me extra readings she thought I would find helpful or interesting, and was wholly encouraging of me going into art history in the future. Her accessibility, kindhearted support, and geniality has truly helped me find my footing within this field, and I felt so lucky to have been welcomed into art history through taking this course with her."

In this course, you will learn about a diverse spectrum of fascinating topics, ranging from Newton's light spectrum to mezzotint anatomical plates, but it is really the structure of the seminar that makes it so special. As a member of this course, I got to see beautiful works from the Harvard Art Museums' collection, speak with curators from both the Museums and the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  and participate in discussions with graduate students in addition to undergraduate peers. Professor Lajer–Burcharth really contributes to the \"buy–in\" of this course, because it is clear that she is fascinated by the topics we were discussing and is genuinely interested in our ideas and perspective of the material. Our weekly discussions were rewarding and fruitful, especially given that we paired our discussions with an in–situ viewing of art from the Museums' collection. This seminar felt less like a class and more like a colloquium of scholars (which I say even as a lowly undergraduate!) discussing topics on the cutting–edge of scholarship in the art history field (and post–colonial scholarship more generally!), especially given Professor Lajer–Burcharth's receptiveness to new ideas and her interest in the materials we were discussing."

      "Well, if you're taking this course you probably have to take it. So I will give some general pointers. First, I think that coming into the semester with an idea of what you want to write about is extremely helpful. Narrowing down at least a topic of study before the semester will allow you to use class to your full benefit and will, in general, make your experience more chill. Second, be aware that the course is quite chill at the beginning of the semester (think 1–3 hrs per week) and that towards the end of the semester, once you start drafting, the work spikes a lot (think 8ish hours per week once you start drafting, with potentially many more during reading period. I think I was spending 4–5 hrs per day on the essay for the week before it was due). This is kind of unavoidable, but the more seriously you take the drafting assignments the better the last few weeks of the class will be. Finally, don't be too intimidated by this course! 25–30 pages is a lot of writing but the course prepares you well for it. The classes are really small and the teaching staff is super supportive and gives a lot of one on one advice and support, so you're in good hands."

      "Well, if you're taking this course you probably have to take it. So I will give some general pointers. First, I think that coming into the semester with an idea of what you want to write about is extremely helpful. Narrowing down at least a topic of study before the semester will allow you to use class to your full benefit and will, in general, make your experience more chill. Second, be aware that the course is quite chill at the beginning of the semester (think 1–3 hrs per week) and that towards the end of the semester, once you start drafting, the work spikes a lot (think 8ish hours per week once you start drafting, with potentially many more during reading period. I think I was spending 4–5 hrs per day on the essay for the week before it was due). This is kind of unavoidable, but the more seriously you take the drafting assignments the better the last few weeks of the class will be. Finally, don't be too intimidated by this course! 25–30 pages is a lot of writing but the course prepares you well for it. The classes are really small and the teaching staff is super supportive and gives a lot of one on one advice and support, so you're in good hands."

There is so much valuable information to grasp from the readings, and the discussions that you get to have with your peers are priceless. Les is such an amazing instructor and is really what made this course a gem. You are essentially given full creative freedom for the final project, and it is such an enriching experience to work under his guidance. Take advantage of office hours because he will open doors to new ways of approaching your idea that you'd never even considered before. The readings are not only interesting, but the load is very manageable as well and it would only take you a couple of hours of focus per week to be able to make the best of class time. If you are a student like me who is also interested in pursuing medicine, I feel that this class was essential to my understanding of how the foundation of medicine was developed, and think that any good doctor should know this history. This discussion style course was 3 hours, but I swear it always passed so fast because of how engaging the discussion and class activities are. 10/10 I could not recommend it more :)"

The challenges make you feel like you're a kid again and it's so rewarding – working with a team that you pick yourself so it's just like friends hanging out doing arts and crafts. Papers are open–ended and creative allowing you to really lean into what you believe. You do not have to read the books to do well on these papers.

I thought it was a great experience and a great chance to learn about topics you might not normally hear talked about in conjunction with one another. The course has a not insignificant amount of readings, which you are asked to write reading questions about at the beginning of each week. Please try to do all of the readings — they're really interesting and important. The larger assignments are three unit reflections and a final exam. The unit reflections are not a big lift at all, but I found it really really helpful to go to office hours and talk through ideas and analysis. If Huw is still TFing the course next year, he's fantastic. The final exam consists of a few essays and was open note, so it's also not about memorization, which is really helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed this course and thought it was a positive experience!"

I've always been a little bit of a history buff, but this class went way beyond the things you learn in every general high school history course. It was so cool to learn prison–specific history and really delve into the ethical, social, economic, and physical impacts of prisons on humans throughout time. Genuinely eye–opening. And the assignments never made me feel like I was drowning in work (one 3–4 page paper due in the first 3rd of the class, then a short creative writing project in the middle, and 2 3–4 page op–eds on topics of your choice as a final). I felt so free learning the material solely to learn the material, rather than stressing out about an intense midterm and final. The creative portions of the assignments were invaluable to the strength of this course. I really did love writing these assignments, and I don't usually like writing essays. Dr. Weinreich is actually a national treasure. He genuinely is passionate about the subject, his research, and his students, and has the best lecture voice. GREAT CLASS!!!"

I loved the variety of sources, from those that are purely history of science, STS, or even Supreme Court decisions. While I think that the discussion–leading is good in theory, I wish that Jasanoff was more involved in asking questions. Often times, the discussion questions were very niche and we didn't make it to discussing all of the readings. For how fascinating they are, I wish the discussions were more grounded in the readings. It might be helpful for the TFs and Jasanoff to lead a discussion in the first or second class for a model of how it should be done and what kinds of questions should be asked. But, often, the discussions felt quite divorced from the readings and it didn't feel productive. Additionally, the feedback in this course is very unclear. All semester, we were getting grades on the basis of a check, check plus, or check minus, which is hard to translate into grades. I liked that they sent a midterm participation evaluation –– something similar for the overall course grade would be really helpful."

      "Absolutely loved this class! Great class for early in your HEB career/if you aren’t in HEB. If you are in HEB, a lot of the content will probably be very familiar, but Dr. Desmond does a great job of bringing up new/different perspectives on these classic topics in HEB, plus referencing ongoing research, outstanding questions, and how these topics fit into wider conversations (a sociology–like perspective tends to come in). The semester–long research project is super doable and interesting, never stressed me out because of the scaffolded assignments, and they give great/specific feedback. Would recommend for a low–stress, interesting class with an open ended research project. One thing to note is there is essentially no neuro content in this class. With a general focus of cognition, you kind of go through a bunch of general topics in HEB."

      "I did poorly in this course because I really didn’t study everyday and trie to cram before the exams while taking 5 classes. I would not take this along with other hard classes and def not as a freshman, I think I really pushed myself too much there and kinda paid the price. Overall, the class is very good and the exams are either you know it or you don’t, no getting around it. You do have to study everyday and continuously memorize or else this classes causes you so much stress pre–exam that you won’t be able to memorize 200+ flashcards before the exams. The professors are incredibly understanding but the lectures are pretty monotonous (even though Jo is extremely energetic) and lots of people just stop going to them because the course really just depends on you memorizing information. I don’t really think there’s any other more engaging way of teaching this because it really just is that. For me, the evolutionary aspect didn’t add anything interesting to the course, I’d look into LS2 before this class because the few physiology parts of this course were more fun than the evolutionary ones. There’s basically no other work outside of class (prob 30min max outside work) so you really should be studying everyday and I didn’t have that discipline so totally on me. Labs were super lowkey and no pressure like LS1a, LS1b or LPSA. Overall, I’d recommend this class if you’ve already taken anatomy (I hadn’t) and I’d actually recommend it over LS1b too for premeds, just because of the more mature environment, more interesting content, better grading, and the greater insight it will give you over LS1b. Drag one of your friends into it and you’ll be fine. Visits to HMS were also super fun and a good experience."

Every week feels like you're doing a fun logic puzzle. Cons:– Weekly reading responses that can get a bit repetitive/boring– The material on the PSETs does not always align with what is taught in lecture/in the textbooks and requires some additional guesswork to finish"

The material is interesting but can get highly technical, and you WILL need to put in the effort to truly understand how to solve the pset problems, especially towards the latter half of the course. That being said, if you are interested in linguistics this is definitely a good intermediate class to take. The content seems like it would be especially useful in language documentation work, and generally helps with developing a deeper understanding of how language is produced in terms of sounds. The phonology problems feel a lot like fun puzzles at times, but definitely requires some practice to get the hang of. The exams definitely required you to understand the material to score well! Overall, satisfied with the class and how it's run, but definitely will note that it is not trivial to anyone searching for a light class."

You can honestly not go to lecture and get by with section attendance, I found section the most useful by far because it is much easier to ask any questions and I hope Natasha gets her bag because she is great and chill (everything you could want for a section leader)Love our professor too, she was great and super nice/understanding (though not gonna lie, I did not get to know her well cuz aforementioned lecture tip thing)"

      "If you have any substantial calculus background, this course will not be difficult and actually becomes a bit of a bore at times. I took AP Calc BC my senior year, and I took this class because I was worried my calculus knowledge wasn't strong enough to take Math 1a. However, if you have taken Calc BC, even if you didn't try much and you feel like you don't have a strong foundation, I strongly recommend taking Math 1a/the next level up. Math Ma/Mb is extremely foundational calculus and precalculus and doesn't go in–depth into many real calculus skills. If you haven't taken any calculus before, this class will definitely be difficult... it's interesting to learn about if you already know the calculus concepts, but if you have to learn both the basic theorems of calc with all the other stuff they make you learn about, it can definitely become overwhelming.  However, coming from a calculus background, I LOVED the content in this course. They really go into deriving where things come from, and because I already knew 90% of the theorems, I had a lot of fun learning!"

Although I feel I am really bad at math and find it very boring ( I took this as a concentration requirement lol), I enjoyed the growth I gained from this class in terms of my comfort with calculus.

      "If you are considering taking Math 1b, I HIGHLY recommend taking it when Amadeus Martin is the course head. He designs the course with the intention of teaching us the concepts in a digestible manner without making the course stressful or overwhelming. I made the move to 1b after taking Math Ma in the fall, and it was probably the best decision I made for myself. While taking this course,  you still need to put in the time to study for the exams and complete all of the psets, but there are plenty of resources available to do just that. I recommend going to the MQC to meet other and do your psets together, or finding a person that you can go to to work on psets together. The exams can be a bit challenging, but if you prepare thoroughly, then you can definitely pass them. As for the psets themselves, depending on how you grasped the topic, how long they take can vary. For me, the worksheets done in class readily prepare you to complete the pset so they can take between 1–3 hours to complete (but the time goes by faster than you realize). I do recommend starting them right away though so that you don't have to worry about them since there are 3 psets a week, but even if you don't do it right away, you will be fine. But yeah, I can't emphasize this enough, take this whenever Amadeus is teaching because he's literally one of the best math teachers here ."

I have heard bad things about the fall version of 1b but the spring version with Amadeus as head was great. Make sure you keep review sheets on topics/series – there is a good amount to memorize for the final. Since the topics don't exactly connect there is a good chance you'll forget a lot by the end of the semester so dedicate a good chunk of time for prep for the final. My section leader Sophia was a little hard to follow at the beginning and sometimes slightly condescending when I asked a question but I don't think it was intentional. Towards the middle/end of the semester, I liked the section and the way she lectured a bit more. Overall good class, I really recommend taking 1b in the spring."

Ended with an A but thought the entire course was stupid. 21a is the exact opposite. Incredible teaching style, exams are fair and inquisitive. Lastly, Roderic, the course TF, might be the best teacher I have ever had. He is one of the most gifted and passionate people at this school. Roderic, if you see this, please never stop teaching. You have inspired me to learn more math and really opened a window of academia I never had before. Thank you."

      "The course made me think a lot about the way calculus can be extended into the multivariable realm. I think that the course did its job in getting me to really stay up to pace and learn what I was supposed to learn through the course – with its intensive three pset per week deadline, two midterms and one final, and workshop. It was a really heavy course but I think that I learned so much over the course of this course and I wouldn't have been able to without my peers and my TF who was absolutely incredible. I think that having a strong AP Calculus AB background is all that is needed to take the course. This was my first official math course at Harvard, so having an AB and BC AP foundation was useful. Many of the topics on BC aren't that important – we didn't do sequences or series at all. Integration techniques are very important so having that background is definitely extremely valuable.

However, this class is NO JOKE. I spent several hours on every pset, and we have three psets a week (so basically, once you finish a pset, the next one comes right away). The assignments can sometimes feel relentless. I spent countless hours in the MQC to complete these psets, but honestly I enjoyed the environment there and made some friends too! The course assistants were very helpful there as well. So if you have trouble, MQC will make your life so much easier. This class was my biggest commitment of the semester. Also, the class is super fast–paced, so try to clear any confusion ASAP, because the material continues to build – do not fall behind.  Despite putting in so much time and effort, I still found the exams quite difficult. Sometimes it felt that I could study so much and still not do well on the exams. However, you're likely taking this class as a requirement lol, so just be prepared that it is a significant amount of work (especially if you have never been exposed to multivariable calc before, as was the case for me). That said, I really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot."

Under this course head, things were completely out of control and not acceptable but the section leaders are really great and the CAs are also super cool and fun.

The Psets are pretty long and a bit tedious/computationally–heavy, and the 3 psets/week schedule can get pretty tough. Finding a pset group to meet with every other day to work on homework can make it more fun and manageable. Regarding the content of the course, some of the topic covered come across as pretty abstract, at least from the POV of someone who has never done any pure math. Make sure to be really comfortable with the beginning topics in order to conceptually understand the more difficult content – the class really builds off of itself throughout the semester."

      "This evaluation is coming from a first year CS major who never took 21a and self–studied 1b. The material can be confusing at times, but usually by the end of the class / after reading the solutions to the worksheets it became easier to grasp. The psets are very doable with just what you learn in class, and I only had to go to the MQC once. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities on the pset to boost your pset grade. There are a few notes about psets though: 1. you don't get ANY late days; if you miss a pset or forget to turn one in, it's a zero or one of your pset drops. 2: you start with only two pset drops, but you can earn up to 5 more through the semester by attending optional quiz sessions. 3. There are 3 psets per week. The first policy is slightly frustrating, but I find the second policy is fair. The 3rd policy depends. Some psets only take 1–1.5 hours, and some weeks you would get three of these. Super easy right? Other psets took 3–4 hours, and there were a few weeks where we would have 2–3 long psets, which made me hate this class during those weeks. More insights to the time required for this class will be provided below. The exams feature a large T/F section, some of which can be very frustrating. However, the rest of the exams were straightforward and had problems that were generally easier than what was on the psets and in the practice exams, but a bit harder than what was in the worksheets. There is plenty of time to finish the exams. They are usually thursday evening, though, which can create some scheduling conflicts. The material itself is actually pretty interesting, but you'll go through it very quickly, so if you really like a particular topic, cherish the 1–2 classes you'll have about it. It does build a lot though, so you'll often use past  concepts again, and the structure which the material covered is very logical.  On average, not including spring break and finals period, I spent 6.38 hours per week on psets/studying. I had peaks in week 12 (12 hours) and Week 5 (9.25 hours). I had several lows around 4–5 hours. One last note, do the pre–readings, especially the handouts. They are SO helpful, and make the material taught in class much more understandable. TLDR: Psets are a bit of a drag, material is good, exams are reasonable, time can vary but is generally moderate."

You will be surprised at how fast you can finish it in the same day at office hours. 2. Meet with your TF at least one week before the exam. You can discuss testing strategies, your progress in the course, etc. Also you're letting them know that you are invested in your learning in this class!3. MAKE FLASHCARDS!!!!! I beg of you. There are so many concepts in this class that build on each other overtime, and making flashcards will help to build that solid foundation you need to reason through exam and pset questions. What I did was write down the learning goals for each lesson on a separate flashcard and then tested myself each night before bed. If you follow this advice (especially 1 & 3) I am sure you will be successful. Good luck Math 21bers!!!! :)"

      "21b is a hard class that requires serious time and commitment to get a high grade. It is by no means impossible, but there are likely better options (22A and especially AM22A). This class does not need to be avoided at all costs, but one should consider skipping 1b or 21a to take AM22a in the fall, which I hear is an easier option. In 21b itself, I highly recommend getting ahead of exam prep. This content is understandable but requires many repetitions to become familiar with. Do all the practice tests and repeat questions you find confusing, it is more helpful than studying the concepts themselves. There is so much to know that trying to memorize concepts is fruitless."

      "Math 21B is an okay course overall. I think every Harvard student should take both multivariable calculus and linear algebra because of how useful it is, so definitely either take the Math 21 series or the Math 22 series. I would say that I learned a lot in the class, but there are certainly downsides to the course as it is structured. I'll list the 3 biggest Pros and Cons as compared to Math 22A (according to my friends who took that class) so you can decide what's best for you:PROS:– The class is structured in small–group setting, so you don't have to deal with large lectures if those aren't your thing (this was the main reason why I took Math 21 over 22)– The support network is very good (CAs and MQC were super helpful!)– Very many people take the class and there are several section times so you can schedule it for whenever you like pretty muchCONS– 3 Problem sets a week. This is the biggest issue with the course . It means you have to constantly be doing math homework throughout the week– Your experience in the course is very dependent on how good your TF is, so if your section isn't good, you'll probably need to switch to learn most effectively– There is usually no curve / a very minimal curve to the classIf this course ever gets changed to be just 1 pset a week and not 3, then definitely take it over Math 22, but until then, use your best judgement."

      "Ok. So. If you enjoyed 21a and liked its structure, I recommend you take this class. Yes, the tests can be hard sometimes. Yes, the psets can take up a bunch of time. Yes, at some times the course can be a little disorganized. BUT if you're willing to put in the work and live with some of the inconveniences, you will learn some pretty fascinating concepts in this course. In my opinion, a ton of material in this course can be extremely applicable to other disciplines, and overall getting to truly understand the concepts and their implications can open your mind to a new way of thinking about math and modeling situations using math. If you find the right section with a section leader you enjoy and find the right group of people to study with, you will find that the material isn't too bad and that the social atmosphere of this course can be actually good at some times. Yes, it's a course that's definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy the math and the people, you'll find a way through it."

I said most of what I have to say in the 55a Q Report, and most of it still applies, but I'll add a few things:First of all, the course community is very, very friendly, collaborative, and supportive. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Harvard or a better course to define my first year here. This class was my least stressful class this semester, so don't worry about it at all. If you put in the effort, you will be fine. Professor Harris is amazing — take anything he teaches — and I'm sure Auroux will be wonderful next year, too. Ask the CAs for help if you're ever stuck, and you will succeed.I would hesitate to recommend taking 55b without 55a. You can probably quite easily catch up content wise (just go over what a group is!), but I think that 55a builds a certain level of mathematical maturity that most non–55 first–years lack. Without that, you will probably struggle in 55b.That said, whether or not you took 55a — 55b is easier. It is less work, and, in my opinion, the content is more fun. Topology and complex analysis are beautiful subjects, and 55 provides a wonderful, engaging introduction to both, preparing you for courses like 213 and 231."

Professor Siu was an unreasonable lecturer, leaving  every single student confused and lost in every lecture, while showing little to no empathy. The lights in our classroom (which are motion sensored), would often turn off multiple times in class, because no one was paying attention. Prof. Siu didn’t care that his students were lost – he only cared about getting through the material. Our TFs were also equally lost, and openly admitted that they did not know what was going on in 113. Our TFs also shared that we learned everything taught in Math 213, the graduate level version of this course. It felt unfair at many times throughout the course when our TFs were unable to explain concepts learned in class, or answer questions in office hours. That being said, the material learned in 113 with Prof. Siu was absolutely beautiful. Complex analysis is such an elegant area of mathematics, and you really feel proud of yourself after completing each problem set, which were all extremely difficult. While it bothers me that this course was not taught at an appropriate pace, this is still probably my favorite course taken at Harvard. The material really is so beautiful, and I am actually thankful that Prof. Siu truly pushed everyone to their limits. Because of this, my mathematics skills flourished exponentially. For that, I will be forever grateful."

Wes is an excellent teacher and he clearly cares about his students, but as many students describe him he is somewhat of a “hardo.” The PSETs are unnecessarily long and time–consuming with annoying calculations. In terms of getting a strong grade, if you have a solid background in math then you can for sure get an A if you obviously take the necessary time on the PSETs. Wes also wants to encourage rigorous mathematics, as people who have only taken the Math 21 series can take this class. You have to get 20 Group 2 points throughout the semester (so averaging roughly 2 a PSET), and you can get extra credit from going over 20 (maxing out at 28). The class also has 2 midterms and a final. They vary in difficulty, but they are certainly fair.  They are all open–note, take–home & unlimited time for a week. They are structured almost like a PSET. The final was definitely more challenging than the two midterms. The course heads also took latex notes, which was very helpful (and so attending class was not a necessity). Wes also wrote the textbook we used in this class. I thought it was solid and could be helpful, but others were not huge fans of it. Wes’s explanations in class are definitely more clear than the textbook."

The material at the start is a little dry, but Galois theory is such a deep and beautiful subject it's worth all the maximal ideals you have to put up with at the start of the course. Just be sure you really know group theory! My impression is that most of the course was from 122, with a few 55ers.Professor Kisin is a fine lecturer. He's not the clearest lecturer in the department and sometimes he makes strange notation choices, but on the whole I never felt like lecture was too hard to follow. Just be aware that it's often his style to state a result, derive consequences from the result, and only then go back to prove the statement.  It can make the line between remark and proof a little blurry, but once you pick up on it it's not a big deal. Also, there were only 4 homeworks all semester and when Prof. Kisin says the exams should be completely straightforward if you do the homework, that's pretty much his way of telling you the exams will mostly be homework questions. Still, I feel like I learned a lot in the course, and I'm happy I took it."

      "My first official course in Number Theory, Math 129 was a very challenging experience. By the end of the course I was able to look back on it and say that I'm glad I did it and that a lot of the theorems learnt were very interesting and beautiful, but somehow while I was taking the course this definitely did not seem like the case.For a little background, I came in to the course initially due to my curiosity with how seemingly completely innocuous questions (Fermat's Last Theorem looking at you) could drive humanity to develop such an incredibly rich subject, and while I did sort of find a bit of closure on that question (through doing my presentation which was one of favourite parts of the course), I was (very surprised) to find that during my experience of actually taking the course, I was really struggling to understand the motivation behind a lot of the material. Long story short, a combination of the p sets being bashy (I say this as someone who is also interested in physics btw – some of the most horrendous matrix manipulation you will ever see is on Math 129 p sets) and very disconnected from lecture, lecture being very bizarrely structured (Prof Mazur did in fact introduce a lot of great things to keep in mind – you just never understood why they are important the first time they are brought up), and the book being exceedingly annoying to navigate (a running joke amongst people who have taken this course is the fact that every single time you are doing work for Math 129, you need at least 5 tabs of Marcus open at the same time just to do one part of one p set problem), somehow made the material feel like a massive slog during the course, which is a great shame because I definitely did not expect things to feel this way.  (P. S. the exams are both hard and sit down, so if you're anything like me who has the memory of a guinea pig expect to have to do a crap ton of memorisation of definitions and proofs to practice for the exams – didn't really give it my best effort tbph and I TANKED; will leave it up to you to decide whether that's your cup of tea, especially in a subject that in my opinion is one of the harder ones to gain good intuition for)Other than everything I just mentioned though, I thought the course was really good – Prof Mazur (as I said earlier) is a legendary figure in the subject and being in his presence was very humbling. He says a lot of good things and is very to the point with his students, which I think is something that is unfortunately missing in this day and age; the TF team was fantastic, but special mention to Eric Shen who did a fantastic job preparing review materials for the course, answering my questions and helping me understand things in a way that I was able to better appreciate both the small details and the broader view of where the material fit in, all while being his usual humble and caring self. With regards to grading, I must say initially found TF Eliot Hodges' grading rubric about \"writing\" very annoying, but tbh by the end of the course I actually appreciated it – it was nice to get someone with more experience to keep me accountable and help me understand what was and what was not accepted as formal mathematical exposition. The material itself is beautiful – its got a different feel to it than some of the more theory–oriented maths courses here like algebra/topology/analysis. Initially I was frustrated because it just seemed like we were being handed a bag of tools for random bashing – but I would say that by the end the theory started to come together and the role, significance and true nature of each tool became much more apparent. It is, however, for me, hard to grasp, as a lot of the mathematics itself was really quite involved – multiple–lecture–long proofs were common (with like 3 asides and 4 presentations sandwiched between them just so to make it even harder to figure out what was going on, obviously), as were definitions and theorems that had so many pieces to them that it is almost comical trying to describe them verbally to someone else (just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about, one of the statements of the theorems starts with \"Let K, L, R, S, P, Q, G, D, E, r, e, and f be defined as above\") – but all in all I thought it useful personally to recognise that confronting a subject with a lot of fine detail and \"little pieces\" so to speak was where my weakness lay and I will for sure spend a decent chunk of the summer trying my best to fix that. So yh, on a purely academic standpoint I'm glad I did it.So, a decent class with some ups and downs – don't romanticise it too much in your head but also don't find this review disheartening especially if you know that the subject is something you have a lot of intrinsic interest for, I'm sure that there will be very many others who felt differently to me. If I were to take this course again I definitely would have read up more on background and motivation (also making sure not to schedule another class during Prof Mazur's office hours would probably have been a good start lmao) and also would have tried to be more present in the course community (had a strange delusion that soloing this course was the way to go; please don't). Definitely did enjoy it overall though and would recommend."

The course, while rich in potential for advanced learning, often glosses over the derivation and proof of key theorems, which are frequently described as \"trivial.\" This approach can hinder the depth of understanding necessary for a rigorous mathematical education, especially in a complex subject like differential topology.Students have expressed concerns regarding the instructor's responsiveness to questions during class. There appears to be a tendency to not adequately address or engage with inquiries that would clarify and enrich the student learning experience. Greater openness to student questions and a more thorough exploration of the topics at hand could enhance understanding and academic success.The workload for this course is notably substantial, with students reportedly dedicating upwards of 20 hours per week to problem sets alone. While a rigorous workload can be beneficial, it is important that it be balanced and manageable, and that it genuinely contributes to student learning and comprehension rather than merely adding to the students' stress.The overall student experience in Math 132 this semester has been overwhelmingly stressful, with many feeling that their educational needs are not being met. An adjustment in teaching approach, particularly a more supportive and engaging classroom environment and a reconsideration of the workload, could potentially improve outcomes and student satisfaction significantly."

For those with a statistics background, this provided a proof–based and more mathematical approach than 110, which was extremely helpful to engage with the topics on a deeper level. Thus, I would recommend it for those who felt Stat 110 was too much of a competition–math approach/tricks and want to dive deeper into probability theory (martingales, stochastics, Brownian motion, etc.)Kevin Yang is an INCREDIBLE (!) professor. He is exceptionally kind and engaging, and his homework was well–designed to supplement what we learned in class (rather than just random textbook problems). I look forward to him teaching Math 114 this fall because he will do an excellent job with the course. Kevin was the most clear and kind lecturer of all the math courses I have taken at Harvard. He always entertains students with questions honestly, and he can build a community within the classroom."

The connections to physics are endless and certainly do not end at GR, learning differential geometry in this way is crucial for understanding all kinds of theoretical stuff. Highlights included the geometric proofs of Noether's theorems and of course the derivations of the Einstein equations. Puskar did a great job of motivating concepts and proofs with geometric intuition that made abstract concepts pretty intuitive.

      "Great course on Riemann surfaces with Professor Kronheimer, but unfortunately will be much much harder next year when it's taught by Siu. This version of the course had a very topological perspective (with Professor Kronheimer himself being a low–dim. topologist), and totally alternate courses could have been offered with much different perspectives (when McMullen teaches it, there's a lot of hyperbolic geometry, sheaves, cohomology, line bundles, etc.).Overall, the lectures are rather dry, and the official textbook Donaldson is not good at all (as all of Professor Kronheimer's graduate students will happily tell you), but you can clearly tell that Professor Kronheimer has a good heart and is genuinely very excited about the topic, both in class, through his many many excellent handouts, and through conversations in office hours. This translates to very interesting and instructive homework problems, which I had a lot of fun doing.Overall, I'd recommend this course, especially if you're an alg–geo / alg–top pilled math concentrator that doesn't want to do any actual analysis (the material of Riemann surfaces gets very geometric in a lot of places, though be warned that analysis is sometimes involved too!)."

      "Fun class. Analytic number theory is quite a gem as a subject of mathematics. The results are fundamental and beautiful; the proof methods are quite unexpected but end up being very very nice. I happen to be a fan of number theory, but in any case, it is an area worth exploring. There are roughly weekly problem sets (though they started week 3); mostly exercises in the course notes. They are relatively chill; nothing nonstandard. Sometimes computational and takes some effort, but overall it is a lighter course compared to some other grad courses I have taken. The final project is a fun way to explore something cool (I wrote about Bertrand's Postulate; there are a good number of options though, such as the PNT error term, which are more technical). The course notes are fairly extensive and relatively well–written; the class provides a decent amount of rigor. However there are frequent typos, some of which are nontrivial and can lead to confusion. I wish more motivation for the main results was provided in lectures (for instance, the proof of the PNT followed is probably the fastest one; however it does not provide a clear relation between, say, the zeta function, zero–free regions, and strength of PNT bounds; thus it is not wholly clear from lecture why one should expect a relation between PNT–type results and analysis of the zeta function near the strip Re z \\in [0,1], which is key to analytic NT). Some more intuitive explanations would have helped here. Overall an enjoyable course!"

      "Math 231BR was a wonderful course and one of my favourites this year. All aspects of the course were rewarding – Prof Hana Kong's lecturing (I know, it was at 9am but it) was superb, office hours were helpful, p sets were very challenging but were also interesting to think about – just really really good stuff.I feel like in 231A we developed a lot of interesting raw machinery that was cool to learn about in isolation but we didn't really do all that much with it, and it was only in 231BR that we really got to apply it – the general theme of 231BR revolved around studying fibre bundles, we did this in good depth and learnt a lot of interesting facts about how to make sense of their geometrical information using the theory we have developed. I think the switch of textbook from May last term to Miller this term (though of course with a few minor hiccups, for instance we were kinda expected to intuit what Postnikov/Whitehead towers were and the Brown Representability theorem was swept under the rug one or two times, but definitely not anything major) was very smart – it was a cool choice for sure having 231A be slightly more category theory heavy than necessary (with correspondingly otherwise conceptually more simple material and have easier p sets) and 231BR be more concrete with genuinely harder material to grasp and more difficult assignments, as I felt that I was sufficiently–well–armed in with fluency in the language and the terminology to start thinking about the more finicky concepts. Definitely would say that the material this term got a lot heavier on the detail and the machinery, and correspondingly the algebraic and geometric sides of the subject had a much more dynamic relationship than in 231A. Regardless, Professor Kong did an outstanding job in lecture and in office hours explaining the material in its most natural form, and I felt like good intuition was conveyed throughout the course for what was going on. Don’t think I will ever see better teaching of spectral sequences.Do establish a good p set group going into this course though, as I feel like 231BR (even more so than 231A) was a course where trying and checking many ideas is an important part of the learning process and it is genuinely way more fun and rewarding to do this together with someone else.Overall, a great class that I recommend to everyone who enjoyed Math 231A and would like to take a first step into understanding how the tools developed there are used in the modern mathematical scene."

Professor Popa is hands down the best instructor I have had in the math department during my time here. Excellent organization and boardwork, and injections of rich wisdom and insight. Don't get me wrong, whatever class Popa teaches will probably not be easy. But that's the point. Some classes if you really want to learn, the instructor and the class are just subpar.

The best part of the course is being able to get the perspective of patients who have the genetic disease we are learning about. Not only is it truly inspiring to hear these patients tell their story, but it is also such a great way to get context for how lab findings and new drugs/new treatments can really change lives. Overall, I highly recommend the course!"

      "This is one of my favorite courses I’ve taken at Harvard. The speakers were absolutely incredible. Lecturers are all at the top of their field and very willing to engage with students in discussion. Further, they brought patients with neurological diseases that were extremely open and honest about their lives. It was a real pleasure to hear their stories–an opportunity not afforded to many undergraduates. Though some weeks were especially fantastic, all of the lectures imparted some wisdom I will carry from this point forward. Importantly, during this course, you will: – Hear the most cutting edge research for neurological disorders, from ASOs to gene editing techniques. – Learn from patients with these disorders and, in many cases, actually using one of the innovative therapies we've discussed. – Discuss papers assigned by the speakers for that week, so all of the selections tended to be extremely recent and directly connected to the course content. The course is really a delight. The assignments throughout the semester–mainly, a presentation and take home final–are not painful. If you have the opportunity to fit this into your schedule, I highly recommend it. The lecturers are all very open to questions, answering thoughtfully and comprehensively no matter how basic or advanced the inquiry. Though you should not let the distance to the medical school dissuade you, note that–if you want to make it back to the main campus before 9pm–you have to leave class a couple of minutes early to catch the M2 shuttle at 8pm."

I definitely do not think computer science background is needed, but having some comfortability in R or Python would be recommended. Also, not a heavy work load at all. Dr. Poornima is such a kind and understanding professor and is always there to help. I definitely leave the class confused sometimes, but after reaching out to her for help, she answered all of my questions. For this being her first time teaching this seminar, I think the class was well organized."

      "I loved this course. It's such a great MMB Seminar. Dr. Silbersweig is very approachable and extremely nice. He teaches us how to look at mental health empathetically and neurologically. He often discusses what the future holds in terms of personalized medicine and questions us about core ideas that society will have to answer when it comes to treating mental health. What forms of medicine are okay? Should treatment be mediated by a Brain–Computer interface? The class also has such a great energy. It's interactive but not in an awkward way and Dr. Silbersweig does a great job at encouraging discussion. The weekly assignments are just summaries of the two of the readings in a meaninful way, and a greater question that the readings made us think about; they were pretty easy, except some weeks the readings were long. Dr. Silberweig was understanding, though, if we couldn't write about all the readings. The final assignment is a 10 page research paper."

The labs were sometimes tedious, but overall not bad. – My tf hosted office hours directly after section/lab time and I found it helpful to do as much of the psets as I could earlier in the week and then stay after lab for office hours to ask any questions I had. I also found SSN a helpful resource. – In terms of PIEs I found it helpful to make my reference sheet by scrolling through the lecture notes and taking notes mostly on bolded words (definitely make sure you know the bolded words) and important concepts, and then taking the practice PIEs and adding to my notes based on anything I found confusing/got wrong. I would definitely try to move fast on the PIEs – as someone who has never struggled with time on exams before, I found myself rushing on most PIEs and almost running out of time on some of them. The actual PIEs tend to be pretty similar in difficulty and content to the practice PIEs, so if you feel pretty solid on the practices I wouldn't be too worried about the PIEs.  – The lab write–ups can be kind of annoying/time consuming, but I honestly would just recommend sitting down for a couple hours, locking in, and just grinding them out. They can seem daunting at first, but if you just answer the questions that they give you it really is not that difficult, just kind of tedious. – Some of the course content especially at the beginning is pretty repetitive if you've taken ls1a and/or ap bio, but towards the middle/end of the course it starts getting more interesting and I found some of the psets to be kind of fun. Overall I would recommend this course and I think there are definitely ways to streamline your experience so that your learning is most efficient."

      "LS 50 is a truly transformative experience. Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes' Theorem!). It's really satisfying seeing how the material from the spring builds upon material from the fall – all the science you learn really *integrates* together. For example, linear algebra is the *basis* for Markov chains which *feeds forward* into neural networks and then suddenly dynamical systems is back to provide a *stable* foundation for models of action potentials. There is so much interesting material in the spring – I especially enjoyed Markov chains, protein structures, and computational sequence analysis. My one note is that the linear algebra crash course is very fast so it might be helpful to prepare for that. You really won't find another class like this. Not to sound dramatic, but LS 50 has the power to change the way you think and approach problems, and an important part of this comes from having the experience of the entire year. Sure, in LS 50A Bayes' Theorem might just sound like a fancy name for two way probability tables and what even is a prior, but when you actually put it into words and apply it to hypothesis testing in the context of sequence analysis, it suddenly becomes concrete and relevant. who knows, this might become some arrival–esque thing where you start to think of your life in terms of ls50 material – there's enough of it to go around.LS 50B is a chiller course than LS 50A – easier psets and exams (and no stat mech) – and by the spring you'll already have had a whole semester to get accustomed with the idiosyncrasies of LS 50, so that altogether makes for a more relaxing experience. This semester is less about trauma bonding and more about bonding over being in LS 50 together and realizing that time is coming to an end.But obviously, the biggest reason to stick with the course is for the community. The LS 50 community is so special and was a significant part of my freshman year – and while it's not immediately apparent, the truth is that the class is really instrumental for building and maintaining friendships. Daily meetings, late night psetting, lab karaoke, and post lab Berg meals go a long way toward forging connections and core memories. Also, you get to partake in designing class merch which is so much fun. Truly, through – the course staff, the CAs, and your classmates are what make the class special. And assuming that you've already taken LS 50A, you already know how kind, available, supportive, and all around amazing the LS 50 course staff is – all the more reason to stay. If you're still on the fence, I highly recommend speaking to them to figure out what's best for you.I cannot stress enough the value of staying for a second semester of LS 50. The content, the connections, the community – there's so much to gain from continuing on. And the spring is much less stressful than the fall, so you'll be alright. You'll do great in LS 50Bby any means necessary. ❤️"

The good thing is that you have 3 teachers and a TF and not that many students. My advice would be to make the most out of office hours. It is easy to get lost in one of the concepts but office hours are always there to help.This course will have to be the center of your universe during the semester if you want a chance of getting and A. Very useful for structural biology though. You finished the class feeling like a pro a pymol. If you are doing any type of research involving proteins, this is the course to take."

      "MCB 66 is an amazing class!! You should definitely take this course! Sam is a great instructor, and the lectures are very easy to follow. If you are interested in cancer and cell biology, then this course is definitely for you! The concepts are very interesting, and the course also teaches you how to read papers, interpret graphs, and analyze the data. The sections are very helpful in discussing papers, and the sections help a lot when answering the problem set questions. The grading is very fair, and the TFs are very approachable and super supportive. The exams are not made to trick you, and all the questions and concepts asked in the exams are discussed in class. Overall, it is a great course with an amazing course staff who is there to support you and guide you through the course! Good luck:)"

As a non–neuro concentrator, I wish there was more emphasis on the clinical or pathological parts of the course. The assignments were super open–ended and fair; students were posed genuine research questions that the field has no answer to yet, so we were really able to flex research/scientific thinking skills. overall an amazing course; I loved it, and hope it can be offered again in a future iteration :)"

The class has improved my scientific literacy through the weekly journal article assignments. The workload is manageable and light compared to other neuro classes with psets. However, make sure to study in advance for exams because the course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time and the exams can get pretty specific. Helena is also great and super knowledgeable. If you have the space and are looking for a way to fulfill the advanced neuro requirement, this is a great class to take."

      "MCB 197 is a brand new course related to gene regulation taught by Professor Amanda Whipple, an expert in the field of gene editing and CRISPR/ASO Therapeutics. As a whole, MCB 197 is likely one of the best classes I have taken thus far at Harvard, especially as it relates to my interests as an MCB concentrator. Given how it was the first year that the course was being taught, I was extremely impressed by how organized the class was, and how receptive Professor Whipple was to feedback.In terms of changes, the main area where MCB 197 can be improved would be the Problem Sets. As opposed to having quizzes/exams, the class incorporates 3 Problem Sets which constitute 30% of your total grade within the class (10%/PSET). At the start of the term, it was made very clear that no collaboration was allowed on the PSETs. However, while this would normally not be an issue as long as students attend Office Hours, MCB 197 was set up in a way where the TF’s were unwilling and unable to provide concrete support when it came to questions on the PSETs. It got to the point where we were individually warned to not ask anything specifically related to a Problem Set question, and to instead focus on more broad and large–scale topics. This resulted in Office Hours seemingly like a complete waste of time and a continuous search for answers and help that never came.Next, the course also introduced something called “Breakout Sessions” which were short assignments done within the last 15 minutes of class, both as a way of applying our newly learned knowledge and as a way of tracking attendance. However, the setup of these assignments were very inconsistent and they went from being included in almost every class to suddenly being completely gone once we got deeper into the course. Additionally, while we were initially told that Breakout Sessions were solely meant to be a form of practice (meaning that we just had to submit what we had by the end of class), they randomly changed them to be completion–based and required students to finish the sections we couldn’t do in class as homework. During weeks where we had PSETs, this timing made the Breakout Sessions very inconvenient and stressful.Lastly, at the end of the course, students are provided the opportunity to choose a disease and engineer a “cure” using a therapeutic we discussed in class. While this is a very interesting concept, the actual application of the project came relatively rough. At the start, students are asked to turn in a Project Proposal and receive feedback. Less than a week later, students are expected to provide a Revised Proposal, where they narrow down their topic choice and provide a slightly more detailed plan. Then, a week and a half after the Revised Proposals, students are expected to turn in their Capstone Poster, which outlines their full project, disease, and cure. In reality, this timeline ended up being extremely inconvenient, as feedback for the proposals (especially the revised one) were not received until the weekend before the entire project was due. Additionally, there is an exponential increase in the content included in the Revised Proposals versus what is required from the Capstone Poster. Going forward, it is absolutely necessary for this timeline to be revisited and revised, as it makes it nearly impossible to complete the project in a timely and high–quality manner.Overall, despite these minor issues, MCB 197 remained an outstanding course. Most of these are smaller issues that will improve with time, and can be linked back to it being the first year that the course is being offered. However, the willingness of Professor Whipple to accept (AND APPLY) feedback truly gives the class the extra boost, showing how the teaching staff truly care about the student experience. As a whole, MCB 197 remains the best course I’ve taken thus far when it comes to content, and is a must–take for any student interested in pursuing anything related to the field!"

Although we know that we have our personal preferences when presenting science and we love to get crafty and artsy, it is important to take away some of the key lesson in scientific communication and that is to be as clear as possible when presenting. I also think that if this is your first science communication course, you will learn a LOT. But don't let this class be the bible and don't be shocked if you learn something different in different Harvard courses on how to give a great talk. Every class like this will always take shape in the way the Prof's that lead it think about how to give a great science talk. Also, be patient with those around you especially if they don't know basic jargon and scientific concepts! This class caters to students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and from a variety of scientific fields which is the beauty of this course. Lastly, don't take criticisms personally. They are there to train you to accept criticisms and think about them in your own time.Okay, P.S. HAVE FUN! The class is chill, you get amazing food (sometimes from Flour bakery), and really friendly teaching staff."

The only difference between just being in HRO and being in 107 is that in 107 you read like 20 pages and write like 500 words per concert, and the exercise is really rewarding. I didn't think I would learn nearly as much as I did from it going in, and I'm really glad I did it. Having more knowledge about the historical background of a piece makes me see it more fully, and in different ways than I do when I play it without any further knowledge. This class is also great because if you take it for two semesters you can just drop another class and still be on track to graduate. This can be really handy to have in your back pocket for when you need it – I dropped math on the very last day I could spring semester, and didn't add any classes, and it was fine because I had four credits from 107. As a result I was more able to take advantage of the musical opportunities in the spring, instead of falling really behind in all my classes due to tour, for example."

The weekly assignments are based on the readings but they can be done by just skimming the reading material.

Coding and/or wrangling complicated software is a huge bonus (and if that's your interest this class is super cool) but not strictly necessary. The homework assignments have the potential to be great spaces to experiment, but take a LOT of time and thus can be frustrating if you're trying to improve at base skills without making essentially full production value projects every week. At one point we had a group project for a weekly assignment that probably took each person 8–10 hours or more, but it was my favorite of the assignments because that time felt put to good use to creatively collaborate. I enjoyed the second half of the course significantly more, where guest composers came to speak and present on their work, and we worked on a final project that was much more open ended than the homework prompts in the first half. Overall, just know what you're getting yourself into, and maybe don't have too many intense classes on top of this!"

Clara is an amazing TF, very engaged, kind, and always willing to help outside of class. Fed is a wonderful lecturer and his passion for and understanding of music are truly unparalleled. I whole–heartedly agreed with every single comment he made on the performance or interpretation of the pieces we discussed; it was truly a privilege to  learn about this music from him.If you're interested in music at all (which I assume you are if you're reading this ;)), you absolutely must take a class with Fed!

Seriously it's a very rewarding course, but attendance is weighted VERY highly so be careful if youre taking a 9am section."

Coming in with some experience with the language certainly helped me orient myself in the beginning when it felt like we were going through lot of new material and vocab, but it's really dedication and repetition that will help you succeed in any language, including Arabic. They say that Arabic is one of the hardest languages to learn, but I think that it really is the most beautiful. You just have to give yourself a chance to immerse yourself in the language, stay on top of the homework every day, and take advantage of all the opportunities you get in class to practice. The Arabic Flow project is such a fun opportunity to practice inside of class, and in–class you will also do a lot of interactive activities that will help you improve your speaking and reading. Don't go into this class expecting it to be easy, but also know that you will be supported if you put in the effort,"

Even if your interests are just modern Iran or the Middle East, learning about the Safavids and the religion they \"brought\" to the country is so vital in understanding so much of the culture, traditions, history, politics, etc. of the country and region. The classes were a great blend of lecture and discussion facilitated very well by the professor. With this format, new concepts could be introduced, but there was always room for students to engage themselves in a rich and complicated historiography. The focus on historiography was also very beneficial both in challenging assumptions about the history of the Safavids/Shi'ism but also for helping frame even the modern scholars we read in a larger historiographical picture."

However, his teaching philosophy with assignments and amount of workload is something that I and a lot of the class disagreed with. If you take this class, just be prepared to devote a lot of time per week, nontrivially more so than other language classes. You will learn a ton of Hebrew within one year (again more so than other language classes), which is the point of the class, but the class has a hard time respecting the fact that you have other things to spend time on. The 9am is also rough. You might think that you will just deal with it, but thats what I did and simply having a 9am everyday made my year that much harder. Not a fault of the class itself, just a fact.  However, I must say that if you do go into this class prepared for the things I listed above, the class itself is a good experience. There's a wonderful Hebrew table every Friday that's a lot of fun, and sections are great. There is an emphasis on learning music written in Hebrew, and the class is generally small enough that it generates a great group dynamic."

My advice is to either (A) make sure the rest of your course load is light or (B) work out an arrangement with your PI where the time commitment is more flexible/potentially involves remote work to make it more manageable. Now, for the grading of the course. I would absolutely recommend having a conversation with potential PI's you are looking to work with about their expectations for what you need to do to get an A. Also, check in weekly with them about whether or not you are on track (if not, what you can do to get on track). As long as you do this, you should be able to get an A. One last thing, do not overcommit yourself or make promises you cannot keep in order to get an A because that will only backfire. Read here for the assignments. The amazing thing about this course is that outside of what your PI assigns you in lab, there is only one assignment! A final paper describing what you did during the semester that is only 5–10 pages long. Make sure you keep track of when this is due because it happens before the reading period (so it can sneak up on you). They don't even require that you have data. And ultimately, your PI grades the paper/gives you your final grade in the class, so as long as you check in with them for feedback and make sure everything looks good, you should be fine!"

I really enjoy the connection between GABA/inhibition and various diseases, especially since this is knowledge I will apply in medical school and my career in the future. In addition, Saad is an amazing professor; he is super knowledgeable so take advantage by asking him all questions you have regarding the research papers and content.

      "This is a fantastic course to provide a broad range of persepctives on computational neuroscience at an accessible and approachable depth. I think the course is extremely reasonable, but you should be prepared to go to every office hours if you want to truly understand the material. I think it is a great course if you are CS and want to learn the applications of the material in a super cool way, or see how another field has contributed to CS. I think it is great if you are neuro or bio and want to learn how quantitative mechanisms have informed neuro as a field. Really valuable! Kristina is super supportive and accessible to help you through. She is very fair and transparent with grading so that you actively see how your choices affect your grade. Tejas is one of the best TFs I have ever had at Harvard; he is beyond knowledgable and has helped so much in walking through not only what we do on the psets, but WHY, and how to make my code clean! He steps through everything very slowly and nonjudgementally without just giving you the answers. Knowing not that much coding background, it is super helpful way to practice your scientific coding skills with gentle scaffolding! Overall, I would highly recommend the course, but only if you will actually care about the course content, because it is super interesting and can change the way you think."

The assignments were super open–ended and fair; students were posed genuine research questions that the field has no answer to yet, so we were really able to flex research/scientific thinking skills. overall an amazing course; I loved it, and hope it can be offered again in a future iteration :)"

However, make sure to study in advance for exams because the course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time and the exams can get pretty specific.

The class made me a more curious person and someone who was better able to ask important and difficult questions. The material in this course technically focuses on philosophy and evolutionary biology, but you do not need any background in either of those subjects. Haig appreciates all points of view and values all comments, and he is a wonderful professor and person. He has fascinating insight and has thought very deeply about matters that I had not ever considered, and his friendliness and enthusiasm about what he studies is contagious.

      "Tl;dr: Professor Schouten, topics, readings, philosophers were great. Class discussions were both great and not great. Not much (traditional) philosophical work was done.Great introductory class to moral philosophy concerning sex, love, and friendship. In this first iteration of the class, a significant emphasis  was placed on whole–class discussions. This was great in some ways, and not so great in others. The discussions were often interesting, funny, and perspective–bringing. Additionally, students' commentary gave Professor Schouten material to work with and helped guide her lectures. However, the amount of time we spent doing class discussions came at the cost of Prof. Schouten actually lecturing. As such, I left many classes wishing that she had lectured more and communicated more of her thoughts on the philosophers' arguments. This brings me to my greatest criticism of the course. Despite the content being engaging, Professor Schouten being amazing, the class discussions being fun, and the readings being relevant and carefully chosen, this course wasn't exactly a philosophy course. I understand it's an introductory course. Even so, we spent remarkably little time actually doing philosophy. Most lectures, we would spend at most five or ten minutes trying to understand the philosophers' arguments (instead, we spent more time understanding their claims and we thought about their claims). As a result, most of the philosophy work happened while writing the two papers. That being said, it's clear that Prof. Schouten has a different perspective on what counts as philosophy, so we definitely did a lot of philosophical–ish discussion."

The format for the course is a great success, allowing us to cover a wide range of topics, but not at the risk of having shallow discussions, and it was a pleasure getting to engage in content outside of the standard philosophical cannon. Furthermore, the assignments are manageable, and Ryan does a great job at making himself accessible to help you along the way.

The subjects can seem disconnected from what is practically important today. But then you remember that \"philosophy\" as we know it was born with the thinkers that we read in this class. These are the foundations.You will walk away having grappled with the role of art in society and come to know Aristotle and Plato––at least their thinking on the subject of art. You get to write a final essay on a topic of your choosing, which can be daunting given that the essay was worth 80% (!!!) of the grade this year. But Prof. Noe will offer unlimited feedback before submissions, which makes things much easier. I very much recommend this course.

But, on the off–chance this course is ever offered again (using Goldfarb's \"Notes on Metamathematics\") or you have an opportunity to listen to a lecture from Prof. Goldfarb, all I can say is: Don'tmiss out! With that being said, I'll proceed as per usual. Consider this a glowing review of the soon–to–be–published Notes.:) The material is highly interesting to someone who has spent a lot of time studying andwriting proofs in math. In order to grasp and discuss the philosophical questions raised in mathematics, I really think the content of this course is prerequisite. Goldfarb's lectures were very effective, as his Notes aretoo. The content can get technical, but everything is well motivated and the payoffs are worth it! Gödel's work on logic were something that I've always wanted to understand on a deeper level, and 144 helped me dothat and go even further. It's been a very rewarding experience to take this class under Prof. Goldfarb."

      "This course fundamentally changed how I approach information, teaching me to critically question everything. I cannot overstate the profound impact it had on my understanding, especially in an era where misinformation and distrust proliferate across digital platforms, this course equipped me to critically question the foundations of authority—who is deemed credible and why—and how these determinations contribute to significant health inequities, violence against women, and other detrimental societal outcomes, all stemming from a predominantly male–informed hegemony.In this class, I've learned to scrutinize the production and dissemination of knowledge, recognizing that even the scientific practices used in the labs for my thesis are embedded with biases that influence how research is approached, interpreted, and understood. Science isn't just about cellular structures but also involves the behaviors and minds behind them, which are open to interpretation. This course provided me with a vocabulary to articulate and challenge the systemic inequities embedded within institutions like Harvard, highlighting the need for a more inclusive and critically aware academic environment.This course revealed the paradox within \"elite\" academic institutions like Harvard, which, despite their progressive facade, often remain entrenched in traditional, white male–dominated paradigms that perpetuate epistemic injustices. This resistance to diverse perspectives and ideas undercuts their mission to foster genuine academic discourse and truth–seeking.Harvard and similar institutions urgently need more courses like this, which challenge us to critically examine our biases and the broader epistemic harms inflicted across all demographics, including white men. Understanding these dynamics is critical for everyone, as it prompts a more inclusive exploration of truth, moving beyond a single, universally accepted narrative to embrace a multiplicity of truths.One of the first readings for this class by Linda Zagzebski emphasizes the significance of epistemology by linking the value of truth and knowledge to what we care about in life. She argues that caring about truth is crucial if we care about anything at all. The reason why we should care about knowledge stems from its inherent value and its instrumental role in enabling us to live well by aligning our beliefs with reality.Zagzebski elaborates on the notion that truth and knowledge are not merely desirable for their own sake but because they enhance our engagement with and understanding of the world.Moreover, epistemology is important because knowledge is often linked to the good life. Knowing true things about the world can help us make better decisions, avoid harm, and pursue our goals more effectively. We should care about knowledge because it enriches our lives by helping us to engage more meaningfully with the things we value.Zagzebski's point is that epistemology isn't just about trivial debates.  It's about understanding how to achieve the kind of life most of us would value – a life informed by truth, understanding, and intellectual growth.In taking this class, I believe I have moved closer to uncovering the truth by peeling back the layers of bias and resistance that have historically marginalized diverse voices.If you're interested in understanding how the concept of a \"universal truth\" can be weaponized to oppress marginalized groups, I highly recommend taking this course."

If you engage with the course, it is totally feasible you will develop:1) An analytic toolkit:  taking this class means reading some of the most persuasive ethicists in dialogue with one another, and then *joining* that conversation2) A system of ethics: the organization of the curriculum offers insights from the most popular ethical frameworks and allows for a synthesis of one's own system3) A life philosophy: in puzzling through the tension between impartial ethics and partial intuitions, one confronts several of the most important questions in life: what do we owe others? what, if anything, should we do? what are the roles of love, companionship, and family in an ethical life? what space is there for individual autonomy in the evolving ethics of an interconnected world?Anyone can take this course; the best background you can have is an open mind and a willingness to engage. The lectures are fantastic; Quinn is incredibly engaging, and I never felt so comfortable or eager participating in class sessions. The readings are so stimulating, and give a great sense of different perspectives in western ethics, articulated convincingly. The assignments are totally manageable, with a focus on eliciting your best work, rather than your busiest. I am proud of content that I produced in this class, and I will continue discussing it's material with anyone who cares to listen!"

Furthermore, Professor Matherne's assignments (as in every course she teaches) are wonderful, proving thorough direction with specific but exciting prompts; even more than this, Professor Matherne leaves detailed feedback on assignments, and she makes herself available to help through the writing process.

      "PS3 is a great class! If you put in the work, study regularly, go to lectures, and do the homework and practice problems, then you will succeed in the course. The course staff is really great, and they always want you to succeed. The course staff are very supportive, and there are also many opportunities to get extra credit in the course. The grading is very fair and generous. The material is also very interesting, and there will be different demos and experiments each class that help you understand the topic better! Overall, I would highly highly recommend the class whether it is a concentration requirement, or as a way to fulfill a pre–med requisite!!! TAKE PS3!!"

      "The course is not too bad, but it is crucial that you understand the material early enough (it builds up throughout the whole semester) and don't get caught in a cycle as you will be having labs, psets, and exams every week for the course. The components aren't  overwhelming, but can be if you are taking other courses as well (took with LS1B and Math 1B). Be ready to study and put in effort though, the class is really not bad in hindsight but it was often overwhelming and stressful knowing you have other exams and work on top of understanding this material.Try on EVERY exam, especially the first. Getting three attempts on a question is better than two or one as you will not always get an easier question on the next attempt or can make a small, correctable mistake that you can try on the next exam.  This happened and often found myself stressed over stars to get a good grade, but everything worked out in the end once I realized how to study for the course and learn the material. The questions are also not easy, there is no partial credit and you will need to get every component 100% correct to get the point which can often seem overwhelming. The concept of stars seemed great, then horrible, but then great once I got the rhythm of efficiently studying. The psets are also designed to challenge you, but make sure you understand them weekly as if not, you will struggle on the exams (like it said in the syllabus). I found myself only completing the psets and not really understanding them which made for applying what I learned so much more difficult. Definitely know the lecture material before attempting, it will all click once you get it. Kathryn and Gregorio are great professors and want you to succeed. Make sure to use their office hours effectively as their sessions are the most useful. They are also happy to meet 1 on 1 if you are struggling, which helped me get caught up and get back on track.The labs are heavy coding based, but not bad. Definitely know the basics python if possible, it will make them labs so much easier, but they are also not very hard and are mainly there to reinforce concepts from lecture and are mainly taking data and analyzing it with python equations.Stay on track, understand the material, put in effort on exams and you will succeed! Getting an A is not too hard, definitely doable."

It’s very very helpful for deepening what we learned in section. typically the hardest pset problem will be covered through an analogous problem in section)., 1x pset per week, 2x midterm, 1x final– lecture is great, a lot of very cool demos – section is super fun! I took 15a off–cycle (spring) and section was very small and extremely enjoyable (our tf Kellianne is also AMAZING! SHOUTOUT KELLIANNE she is the absolute best! Such an amazing physics tf, but an even better conversationalist)– psets are very very manageable if you pay attention in lecture/section. textbook readings are also extremely helpful, especially for special relativity. most of the readings are extremely short (3–5 pages per week, with the exception of the special relativity readings), so you should really do them. take time to write out your entire thought process (esp. motivating steps, e.g. why you went from step 1 —> step 2, what prompted you to do so. this will really help you out on a exam! most of the time, you know what to do at each step, but forget the in between). – midterm 1: manageable if you understand everything on the psets – midterm 2: very special relativity heavy — definitely study that the most! it was at least ~60% of the points on the exam– final: covered everything, a lot of the questions we have seen before so definitely go over all your past psets & midtermsin general regarding exams:– prof mundy is an amazing instructor in that she really emphasizes that good physics is good physics, not fast physics. she truly tries to give you every opportunity to demonstrate your understanding. with that, here are a few quirks regarding physics exams(w/ mundy): 1. untimed (you have as much time as you want. people stay on average ~3–5 hours for the midterm, ~4–7 hours for the final) 2. 1 FRQ from pset (each exam will have one FRQ pulled word for word from a past pset) physics night: psets are due thursday before noon lecture, and every wednesday night, 15a flocks to the physics library in jefferson and cranks through the pset together. it’s such a great time and I feel like our class was a lot more familiar with each other because of it. plus, unlimited cookies, fruit, and apple cider! it’s the best time."

      "Physics 143a is a good class overall, and is a must–take if you want to do any higher–level physics or chemistry. The grading is very generous for exams and psets (partial credit even if you get the problem itself completely wrong which is nice), but this is for good reason: the course material is fairly abstract and not always intuitive.  Louis is a great professor: he is very accessible outside of class and is good at lecturing, but the lectures and psets were not always a 1:1 match.  The support network for the class is extensive and super helpful. Definitely go to physics night and get help, even if you don't think you'll need it! The class was fairly intense: the psets took around 10 hours per week, but this was mostly because they were calculation–intensive. While calculation–heavy psets weren't my favorite, the exams were all very conceptual, which was great. Louis structures this course to make everything stress–free so that you don't need to care about grades, which is awesome.  Overall, I would say that physics 143a is an enjoyable and informative class that certainly has its quirks, but is definitely worth taking if you can devote the time necessary to it. Hope this helped :)"

Studying both classical and quantum approaches to optics, with their various degrees of formality, all give tremendous insight with regards to both theoretical (seeing how the various levels of model simplification in classical optics make themselves amenable to the description of key phenomena of light) and experimental (studying the immense scope of applications of the simple principle of interference) considerations, as well as physical (thinking about the behaviour of Gaussian cavities, geometrically interpreting time evolution of superpositions of spherical harmonics) and mathematical (the multitude of natural and beautiful applications of harmonic analysis, most notably the duality between convolution and multiplication of functions) intuition. 175 is also one of the main undergraduate courses where one sees both classical and quantum theory in action, which both makes it an important history lesson, both in terms of the theory itself (seeing how one would go abouts forming true quantum analogues for our beloved classical objects such as the theory of coherent state solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator) and in terms of the experimental tools that quantum optics has gifted to us (notably laser theory, which is a wonderful playground for a lot of interesting ideas in the experimental side of physics). It has all the ingredients to be an absolutely beautiful segway into modern AMO that I am certain many students would find both fun and useful to take. \tSecondly, the problem sets in this course are absolutely the star of the show here. None of them are particularly long or overly bashy, and so are definitely not a huge huge time commitment, yet I feel like they are some of the most well–constructed problem sets I have seen from any course I have taken at this school. Unlike certain other aspects of the course, they are written to appeal to a wide range of interests, and often are able to give tremendous amounts of important physical and mathematical intuition and to serve as an excellent way to make sure you actually understand what is going on in lecture. (The interference problem set deserves a special mention for contributing 100% of the intuition I now have for what Fourier theory actually tells us, despite the existence of several other courses in maths and physics that I have taken which have made absolutely pathetic attempts in comparison to do the same; doing the problem sets for the quantum optics unit of the course genuinely helped me stop panicking about the class and about whether I actually understood what was going on). The problem sets are relatively light compared to some other courses in the department but definitely not completely trivial – it can be pretty hard to figure out what to do when you're stuck – but they definitely make the course feel like a good bang for your buck. \tThirdly,  TF Lev Kendrick did an absolutely incredible job and has been a shining beacon for helping me clear up all misunderstandings I have had in the course. He is fantastic at gauging his students' backgrounds and re–explaining the material in the course in a way that would maximally benefit them. I will recommend any course that he TFs.\t Onto the bad news.\tUnfortunately, I have not really been a big fan of Prof. Greiner's lecturing this term. He clearly is an incredible physicist with an absolute fortress worth of wealth in terms of physical intuition, but two main aspects of his teaching have kept me a bit apprehensive about the course. \tOverall, I felt as though the presentation of the material, although done in an order that makes a lot of sense, was rather disorganised. Prof Greiner's poor blackboard management makes lecture incredibly difficult to take good lecture notes from. If one's attention slips even for a short while, one can and often will find themselves completely and utterly lost about what is going on. The real highlights of Prof Greiner's teaching are the excellent snippets of intuition that he gives verbally during lecture, which would be perfect in an ideal world where everyone had perfect focus and was able to jot down exactly what he was saying in real time, but of course this is not possible. It also happens that Prof Greiner goes through all calculations incredibly slowly on the blackboard (this is especially notable during the second unit when long QM calculations seem to be a ubiquitous culprit with regards to ensuring that the student will lose track of what is going on conceptually), which thus makes it especially hard to catch the real takeaways every time he goes through a computation. Not only that, but if one attempts to look at the lecture notes he posts on Canvas to try and understand what happened, one is usually left disappointed as these are incredibly terse to the point where it's often difficult to even decipher what exactly he is trying to illustrate. All of this resulted in me spending more time finding out what was going on than actually trying to understand what he was saying, which made for a somewhat frustrating course experience.\tProf Greiner's amazing physical intuition is extremely beautiful to watch, but often his attempts to convey this intuition result in correspondingly huge losses in mathematical rigour. I'm all for presenting us with a clear setup of a problem or example followed by a clear statement of the final result if the computations involved were sufficiently routine, but Prof Greiner's lack of rigour made it sometimes quite unclear what it even was that we were trying to bash in the first place, which is not ideal when you're learning the material for the first time. Lev again was instrumental in helping me deal with this, and even helped elaborate some more on some of the relevant underlying mathematics (if you ever wondered what taking complex analysis in physics was useful for, I have finally found it to be used a nontrivial amount in AMO), but it was sort of frustrating waiting for section or office hours to clear this up nonetheless. I feel kind of bad complaining about this to be honest, as I am really grateful for Prof Greiner's focus on intuitive explanations – these get harder and harder to come by as you get higher up the department and knowing exactly what some of the maths is telling you definitely gets difficult in 175, but I just wished that there was sufficient rigour to make it clear exactly what his intuitive approach was trying to justify. \tIt really is a shame that Prof Greiner's genius was not conveyed to me as much as it should have been this term, but I think the issue might just be that currently the course is designed for people wanting to go into an AMO lab for summer/ term–time research, when the course could be adapted to accommodate a larger range of backgrounds and interests. Having spoken to a few upperclassmen doing undergraduate research in AMO, they seem to all have really appreciated how much perspective 175 gives them in their lab work, and I am completely not surprised – I just think it so happens the course has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic introduction to AMO that would be received better by a much wider range of physics concentrators had it just been a bit more clear and organised, and I guess I am just somewhat frustrated that the course is not attaining its massive potential.\tAs usual, none of my physics department Q guides would be complete without a discussion about prerequisites, so here we are. I personally think that to gain a meaningful understanding of the course content, Physics 153 (or equivalent) as well as a solid first exposure to quantum mechanics would be ideal. The first of which I would argue is important as Prof Greiner does not really go very far into the theory of electromagnetic optics in 175 (stuff like wave guides are left completely undiscussed, for example) and it is also assumed that one has knowledge of D, P, H and M fields for example to talk reasonably about birefringence. Of course, quantum principles are essential for understanding the theory of quantum optics – I specifically did not recommend Physics 143A as I believe that to be an insurmountably terrible course whose horrendousness is not often realised until long after its completion; if that is your quantum background coming in (as was mine), you will be alright but be prepared to be horrified in 175 by how absolutely insignificant your knowledge and intuition of quantum mechanics would be coming out of that (which to be honest is probably a good character–building moment, I just have a lot of residual resentment for it still a year and a half later). Haven't taken 15c so I can't really judge on how good that is as a means to prepare you. Essentially, if you have a decent working knowledge of QM, a knowledge of EM optics, and know a couple basic wave principles, you will be ok.\tAgain, a course that in my opinion has the potential to be the physics department catalogue's shining star, but currently with some very high highs and (in my opinion) some definite lows. Will still definitely recommend the course in its current form if you don't really mind the things I discussed, just so you could see for yourself how interesting AMO can be."

      "Where do I begin...\tMy second–favourite course of all time, Physics 210 was a truly fantastic experience. I came in to the course with high hopes and little intuition, just purely interested in the course to learn about \"the most beautiful scientific theory of the 20th century\", and let's just say it did not disappoint. \tLet's start with the star of the show. Prof Jacob Barandes is an outstanding lecturer who clearly cares an incredible amount about his students and physics education as a whole. His endearing and respectful personality, excellent board–work and fantastically engaging presence just made lecture an absolute joy to be in. Combining this with how much he cares about presenting the historical development of the physics and his emphasis on instilling within us a genuine, intuitive conceptual understanding of the material has resulted in GR lecture actually giving me goosebumps and leaving me in awe of the material on very many occasions. Informal chats with Prof Barandes at the end of lecture were great opportunities to gather further perspective on the material, learn about his fascinating research and hear what follow–up questions other students have, leading to a wonderfully vibrant academic climate in the course that I will look back upon fondly. The course staff in general were excellent, but a well–earned special mention and thank you goes to TF Rui–Zhe Lee, for his great patience, knowledge, humility, kindness and approachability. \tThe material itself really lives up to its legendary status in physics. I really enjoyed the discussion of relativistic field theories that leads up to the derivation of the linearised Einstein Field Equation in unit one, which I understand to be something that is uniquely covered in Jacob's course, as it really nailed home the similarities in construction between Maxwell's Electrodynamics and General Relativity. The third unit (on the physics of curved spacetime), was the heart of the course and possibly my favourite section of any class I have ever taken – the final two weeks, an incredible collage of the astrophysical phenomena that the theory allows us to describe, was genuinely instrumental in keeping up my excitement and curiosity for physics through what is normally an exceedingly stressful time of the year. Overall, there are one or two lectures that are in my opinion need a little rethought, and depending on one's level of mathematical maturity the middle section of the course might feel a bit out of place pace–wise, but otherwise I am in strong agreement with the course's current structure. In general, Physics 210 just does a brilliant job of acting as a very necessary confluence of all the little streams of knowledge flowing in a student of theoretical physics' mind (Courses on Analytical Mechanics? Electrodynamics? Quantum Mechanics? Pure Maths? Pop science exposure (desperately in need to be rephrased rigorously)? They all combine here to make one beautiful unanimous whole).\tPhysics 210 is in general known in the department as a course in which the coursework is famously \"bashy\". Whereas I will not attempt to dispute this, I will say that Professor Barandes does make the experience far less painful than it would otherwise be by making most of the quite involved computational problems be key steps in results that we establish in lecture, so that even when we are in agony bashing tensor calculus on a blackboard late at night in Jefferson, we are constantly reminded of the significance of what we are doing each time we review the course material. In addition, unlike in some pretty infamously glaring examples of physics courses on this campus, one does find that in Professor Barandes' problem sets that staying close to one's organic mathematical intuition when solving problems does give a clearer picture of what is going on – always is a great plus to see a course be built upon solid conceptual understanding in all its aspects. Just a heads up – please do have a TF around when you try getting off the ground for the first time with Einstein notation, I was fortunate to have it be carefully walked through the first time around which was very helpful as I got the chance to integrate it very naturally with my structural intuition of linear algebra quite well early on before things started becoming too involved.\tAs is typical in my Physics department Q guide reviews, I feel a need to give my take on the prerequisites of the course. I am of the opinion that one will benefit the most from Prof. Barandes' Physics 210 having previously done Physics 151 and 153, and have the mathematical preparation of Math 22 or equivalent. None of my recommended prerequisites are formal requirements of course (besides like basic mechanics including Newtonian gravitation, and of course Linear Algebra and Several Variable Calculus – just a heads up these are most definitely completely necessary), but I am of the view that 210's narrative will make the most sense for those with the background I have just described – the physics discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the language of classical field theory with Maxwell's Electrodynamics being frequently revisited as the de facto example, and the mathematical discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the notion of an abstract vector space, for example, and will present mathematical ideas at the aforementioned level of exposition. Minor detail, but I will however put a word against having done a differential geometry course beforehand, however, as one would put themselves at risk of not enjoying the middle unit of the course as much as they would otherwise – not saying that one would find it dull (I have heard that Prof. Barandes' GR teaches Math 136 better than Math 136 does, and I can imagine that this is true), just an \"I wish I learned things the other way around\" kind of feeling if you get what I mean. This is definitely specific to Prof. Barandes' 210 though – I have heard that other versions of the course tend to do a less thorough treatment of the mathematical side of the subject, in which case it would probably make more sense to disregard what I just said. Definitely speak to more alumni of the course to get their views on this however, as I feel like this is both a subtle and a subjective thing to discuss – I'm just presenting my view on the matter.\tOverall, a phenomenal course that I would recommend to everyone interested. I strongly believe that every student of physics will be at a stage in their education where Prof Barandes' GR would be an excellent addition to their catalogue; if you capitalise on this and take the course at your \"proper time\" (no pun intended), Physics 210 truly has the potential to blow your mind every lecture and remind you of how exciting life can be as a student of our wonderful subject."

With an awesome lab partner, maybe less. With a crappy lab partner, definitely more.Go in excited about the experiments. It's a really fun, really useful, and really unique class in the physics department. Good luck!"

      "this class was actually a continuation of grandma's thanksgiving dinner – last year you were so full that you never wanted to take another bite of food again, but after a good nights sleep you wake up hungry and yearning to go back. i went into this class with great expectations because this semester promised to touch on some of the modern concepts and problems in qft and the standard model, and it did not disappoint. this class just begins to touch on some of the modern ideas used in high energy, and I feel like i have a good base to start exploring more into the stuff that people are currently doing. back to the analogy, this was completely in the same spirit as last year's thanksgiving dinner, in the sense that halfway through the roast turkey you suddenly get hit with a wave of drowsiness and you cant really eat anymore. but this time it feels even worse than last year. as usual, the course got pretty heavy after the first few weeks, but this time i would say it was a more sustained sort of difficulty that persisted through the entire semester after the first few weeks. again, i felt that the best way to really learn the material was by doing psets, and even though they were biweekly, they were involved enough that it would keep you busy for the whole 2 weeks inbetween. as usual, relying on the textbook and the tf was absolutely essential to completing everything on time – Arindam was great and gave us lots of help during OH, which was greatly appreciated. At the end, the course reminded me of thanksgiving dinner again, when everyone would start gathering and telling stories, but on occasion some of the older people would start randomly throwing shade at literally everyone on the dinner table. Final presentations were interesting to sit through because everyone presented on really interesting stuff, and it gave us a good idea of what doing research in high energy theory even begins to feel like. but during every single presentation, prof schwartz was quite critical of each presentation and really drilled us on our familiarity with our projects. its very intimidating at first considering that some of us might be very new to presenting, but in retrospect it really is good criticism, and its good to help us get accustomed to the kinds of questions that people will ask. what really stood out to me is that at the end of the drilling, prof. schwartz would still commend each group on their effort and reassured us that we did a great job despite the difficulty of our topics. this in my opinion is what made him such a great teacher, and what made this class bearable and enjoyable to look back on even though the concepts were not the easiest to understand."

      "A wonderful course on quantum information theory. The material is amazing and super interesting. Highly recommend. The every–other–week pset gives you adequate time to devote to actually understand the material, and the lack of exams is very comforting. That's not to say that this class isn't difficult; it very much is. The psets are often quite time–consuming and require a genuine understanding of the material to solve, but they are written well and really make you think more about the content. Nazli and Andrew, the teaching staff, are also wonderful people and very knowledgeable. Lukin's lectures are also fairly understandable. All in all, a great course that you should definitely take if you are at all interested in quantum information theory or computing."

      "Subir is not the best lecturer in the world and doesnt explain a lot of things, but he is certainly very entertaining to watch in lecture. he has very strange quirks that you just cant help but pick up on in lecture. I really enjoyed taking this class with my fellow undergrads because subir was so memeable that this course became very fun even though the psets were not fun at all. the material was very important to know for condensed matter, but there is an implicit requiremnt that you already know quantum field theory before taking this class. Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things."

Read the memoir books, they are really great books and easy reads, the 2 4 page essays are guided and really easy, and not graded too difficulty.

Work on your paper early, and schedule meetings with your TF ideally with questions prepared. Also, DWF, Maggie, was a great resource, so book with her as well for extra support."

I came in worried that we would not talk about intersectional concerns or focus on a narrow swath of psychology, and from day one realized that not only was that not the case, but the ways we could connect psychology into the topics of interest were much more broad–ranging than I had thought. Dr. Noll is phenomenal and truly cares for her students, as you can see from the way she structured the course and its assignments and simply how she interacts with us, and is always supportive of our needs and goals, and even helps us with things beyond academia. I also became great friends with everyone in the class and looked forward every Tuesday and Thursday to seeing them. One caveat – you will be asked to produce a TON of writing with weekly one–page single spaced reading logs, and around 6ish longer papers as well. Although they are fun and reflective, they do take a lot of time if you care about the work you're producing (which we all did out of a passion for the subject)."

Half way through, we do a week of case studies where we get to pick whatever topic we want and apply what we have learned so far to talk about a problem with stress. Everyone's topics were so interesting and personally relevant. Prof Tsai is so nice and engaging, and really values student input and thoughts.

The average on both quizzes/exams was an A–, so hopefully that says something! The final was a paper instead of an exam, so that reduced a lot of stress, but it was also interesting to write. Professor Somerville is so kind and sweet and supportive!! You can tell how passionate she is about the material and that she wants her students to be successful. She also gives extra credit, which I feel like is rare at Harvard. One of the best courses I've taken here!"

Grace really takes the time to get to know her students (sit in the front!!), and is amazing at conveying more confusing concepts in easy to understand ways. She also takes the feedback of her students very seriously and actively tries to improve her course even throughout the year, which I appreciated. The workload and assignments were very fair and not hard at all if your studied. They are open book/notes/Internet, but if you rely on that on test day you're gonna get really confused and stressed out. It's a chill class so just take a bit of time to review concepts and coding when you can. Enjoy all of the jokes and Pokémon references she puts in her lectures! It felt like being a kid again while learning highly applicable content :) Also, if you take this concurrently with ECON50, you get double the experience in R which is helpful if you're trying to learn it fast.

The psets are often quite time–consuming and require a genuine understanding of the material to solve, but they are written well and really make you think more about the content.

The TF was great and the professor is incredibly intelligent, however, that sometimes works against him. He dumbs down the topic to make it easier to understand but it is still incredibly difficult to understand and incredibly nuanced. If you do not have a theory background this class will not be a walk in the park and will involve doing some extra reading in your free time. Things get quite hectic at the end of the year I felt like I had 2 psets a midterm and a project to complete all within the same week, but the rest of the semester is less bad. However, I took so much out of this class and learned so much about theoretical chemistry. Anyone interested in a theoretical phD or grad school should definitely take this class and people who are interested in knowing more about the methods by which they conduct their chemical calculations should as well. Don’t be too intimidated by the math on the board as the professor intends for students to gain a conceptual understanding as evident by the exams. But, the psets did involve some deep dives into calculations. All in all, it was quite fairly well graded."

The essays (two) are graded fairly and doable. You should also be willing though to invest some time into the course. To actually profit from the course, you need to engage in the reading and spend significant time on the reading (~100 p. per week, that can be quite dense philosophy in the beginning). Also invest some time in reading the summary from Livingston in the course reserves. On the other hand you only have one class meeting that is mostly discussion based. In these discussions Chip fosters a truly welcoming environment, thus you can truly voice your opinion. (I for example would call myself a fairly liberal protestant, whereas other course participants were more traditional catholics and we could engage in a reasonable, lively and helpful discussion)."

I also found it annoying that we seemed to learn a ton of different conjugations in a very short amount of time towards the end of the semester which resulted in me not really absorbing or truly learning any of them. Overall I think if you are simply trying to fulfill the foreign language requirement French 10/11 is a good way to do it as they are not particularly difficult and do not require a ton of time outside of class to get a good grade. Also, I do feel like I learned a decent amount of French."

      "This is honestly a pretty good course and an excellent way to complete your language requirement. The fact that you receive 8 credits for one course and satisfy the language requirement in one semester makes it a \"really good deal.\" That offering for this course is completely merited though. You really do learn the full contents of French 10 and French 11 and leave the course as a shockingly decent French speaker. The course is well–structured, though there are times where it feels like you may learn a bit ahead of the pace of course as it takes time to get to tenses/grammatical phrases. The idea of having everyone create a character in a Parisian appartment building is unique and makes the course a bit more fun. All the work that's completed for the class genuinely does improve your French ability.You'll leave this course ideally at the B1 CEFR level which is pretty good. I actually feel like I can somewhat speak French now and that's pretty remarkable for just a semester of work. Showing up to a class 5 days a week isn't for everyone (and when they say 5 days a week, they really mean 5 days a week since the syllabus allows for very few missed classes). Fortunately, our class met at 12pm which isn't too early, though attendance may be more challenging if this course is offered at an earlier time in the future. I have few criticisms of this course. It did always feel weird that it was run by Dr. Mills technically even though it didn't seem people in the course interacted with her. Anselme, the actual teacher, was excellent and cared about our learning French and fully addressing all our questions. Another thing is that you'd expect a class with ~15 people meeting every weekday to cause people to forge some strong friendships, but, to me, it seemed like everyone in the class liked each other, but that nobody was particularly close. That's not even a strong criticism, just a counterintuitive observation.If you're interested in French, want to get your language requirement done, or like learning quickly: take this course! It's pretty well–run, you'll learn a lot of French, and the 8 credits is pretty nice. The grading always feels fair, and as long as you attend and submit things on time, you'll probably do very well. The one strong piece of advice I have is to do all of the homework exercises each week. They don't take very long, and while you could just look at the answer key, I don't think most people do because it's a very good learning tool. I always took my time on the exercises and then corrected them after because it always filled gaps in my knowledge in a pretty efficient amount of time and also prepared me well for the quizzes. I'm glad I took this course, and look forward to being able to speak more French. I originally dreaded dealing with my foreign language requirement, but after my positive experience in French 15, I may take more French classes at Harvard."

I felt a little out of place, because the speaking element of the class/other students was very advanced (which may have been a feeling unique to me). But, stick with it. It's a great, truly immersive class. The class is very participation–heavy, which I was often nervous about, but it helps to put yourself out there and try to speak aloud more frequently. Our teacher was very encouraging and made us feel comfortable and supported (don't overlook office hours!). I learned so much about French language, grammar, and culture, accompanied by dynamic featured speakers and virtual conversations with French speakers."

      "Do not be intimidated by the title of the class. Just because it is \"upper level\" does not mean that you are expected to understand the language perfectly. The course reviews concepts such as passe compose and imparfait that you learned in French 20. The only difference is that there is a greater emphasis on speaking and communication.My best advice to you is to make sure that you schedule to attend your professor's office hours (which are the Language Tables) to get help understanding the concepts being taught in class. Whether it is practicing your speaking, listening comprehension, or reviewing grammar structures, make sure you are getting the most out of the resources available to help you thrive in your French class.At first, I was pretty scared about taking the class just by the name and the fact that we needed to speak more often. However, I saw that the more I participated and listened to conversations in class and met with my professor 1–on–1 for French assistance, I grew more confident in my speaking and writing skills. This class will require effort, but it is fun, and you will improve your speaking and writing skills immensely as long as you put in the work.Oh! For the exams, make sure you review the PowerPoints and take the practice exam. Afterwards, schedule an appointment with your professor for feedback on your comprehension of the material."

The final project and presentation is also very fun, reasonable, and the break from an exam is especially great during a packed finals schedule! This has been by far my favorite course in the Italian series here at Harvard, take it!!!"

However, especially since this was the first time the course was offered, it was a bit difficult to follow along with how each topic relates to each other, and sometimes the work can feel a bit like busywork.

The material is presented in a bit of an unorganized fashion. I recommend watching YouTube videos or looking online for condensed versions of the content so it is more digestible. It makes it significantly easier. If you stick with it, keep pushing yourself, and practice, you can and will do well. I would say it's pretty rewarding.

You won't have any trouble keeping up with the assignments or successfully completing the projects/exams so long as you give reasonable time and attention to each. It's also worth noting that attendance is heavily emphasized––which makes sense because so much of this class involves practicing talking to others––so plan to attend every class, and keep that in mind when choosing your section time."

I loved the small class environment and felt like I was truly able to practice my Spanish and grow throughout the semester. This course isn't going to suddenly make you fluent, but it's helpful to strengthen your Spanish abilities without too much stress. The assignments were very reasonable and not too overwhelming, though there was a spike in work when we read the novel which was difficult to keep up with. I thought it was interesting how we examined four countries through different mediums – this course is well–structured. I recommend!"

      "*** Xiomara was the best teacher I have had ever. Kind, caring, respectful. Graded things on time, with amazing comments. She actively encouraged us to learn, and everything we did in class was fun. I genuinely enjoyed taking this class. Xiomara was one of the most kind, intelligent, and engaging teachers we have ever had. And I do not say that lightly. She genuinely cares about her students. She actively prepares for every session – and we all could tell that she put in hours of preparation for every lecture. She was confident about the material she taught, and she was very knowledgeable in every aspect of the language and its technicalities. She engaged us and encouraged debate about the topics we discussed, fostering some of the most intellectually rigorous conversations we have had in our college careers thus far; with her guidance and pointers, we not only better understood the points we were making as well as the opposing perspectives, but we learned how to do it all in Spanish. Xiomara also took the time to meet with so many of us individually to ensure that we not only understood all the topics, movies, and grammar we discussed, but also understood how to apply it in our daily lives and how to use the words and grammar we learned in our everyday conversations. Xiomara spent hours beyond the scope of Office Hours and Class to meet and make sure we all understood the material being taught. That is only the tip of the iceberg as to what makes Xiomara an amazing teacher and mentor.Xiomara prioritized learning for learning's sake. She made class discussions fun; this was the class we all looked forward to. Not all language teachers allow for such an educational and fun atmosphere, one that every student wants to go to: Xiomara is unique in this respect. And it paid off: we all feel more fulfilled and more knowledgeable than ever before, as a result of Xiomara and her teaching. There are not many teachers who are as passionate and as caring as Xiomara is, yet are also as effective. We learned more in Xiomara class than we did in some other classes taught by well–seasoned Professors. And that is a testament to her genuine passion for her students and the material at hand. Xiomara is not a traditional teacher; she is one of the best teachers we have had. In a world where good teachers are becoming a scarcity, Xiomara is the epitome of what a good teacher ought to be."

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! This class is one of my favorite classes I've ever had at Harvard. The readings are sometimes difficult but DONT WORRY! You are never assessed on your analysis or deep understanding of the text since the assignments are not expository but CREATIVE. You have the ability to discuss the texts with others in class to understand the material (to help you learn), but the assignments are not designed to be stressful at all. I really enjoyed writing creative pieces both individually and in groups (exams in this class are friendly performances with a group). Grading is really nice too. So, if you want a class to improve your Spanish writing, reading, and speaking without stress, take this class! Also, Wilnomy is a really engaging and one of the kindest instructors I've ever had. She helps me so much in class when I am confused and helps on in–class assignments as well."

You also already know how to analyze Spanish literature.This course does make you act out certain scenes, so know that coming in. I know that put me off at first, but you get so close to your classmates & the professor is so kind & supportive it ends up being so much fun.Make sure to pay close attention to the passages the professor highlights/focuses on in class & take notes on them because they will appear on your homework assignments/exams.Make sure to pay close attention to the hw assignments & what you click because although you get three tries for the homework, they take the average score and not the highest.Overall this is a very fun and manageable class!"

This class did help me maintain my Spanish at the very least and it wasn't too difficult. However I thought it was difficult in all the wrong ways.

Wilnomy is an excellent instructor, and this class was never boring. Having good speaking skills is crucial to succeed in the class, however, as there are two oral presentations that are 7–15 minutes (depending if you have a partner), and the exams are 15–minute long conversations with a small group of peers where you must listen and respond to what is being said (no notes allowed). Also, the readings can be a bit long and complicated. However, this is an excellent course and I would highly recommend for those that need to fulfill a foreign language or citation requirement.

Professor Khitrova is an incredibly knowledgeable, witty, and clever lecturer with a huge passion for the topic, and that really shows through every single one of her lectures. This course will take you through all the major ballet developments, you will get to see some amazing shows (recorded and live!), and the workload is very reasonable!

      "One of the best classes I've taken so far at Harvard. The readings are stellar, Prof Weir did a great job in choosing the books for the syllabus. It's a roughly chronological journey through the years of the Soviet Union which was nice because we got to learn about how it came about and grew and progressed. Lecture was once a week for two hours which was also great because Prof Weir lectures the first hour to provide background and context and then we discussed/looked at interesting passages for the second hour. Sometimes the readings were a lot for one week but I found them to be quite worthwhile and enjoyable. There's no other homework and the other assignments were two papers. I felt the grading was good, not inflating but also not super harsh. Feedback was given and I felt it was constructive but also recognized good writing too. Section was every other week which was great, we could talk and discuss in smaller groups but not weekly because some readings didn't need it/sometimes we'd spent two weeks on authors or books. One of the highlights of my semester! Would love to take another course with Professor Weir if my schedule allowed, highly recommend this one for anyone interested in Russian literature and/or the Soviet Era in Russian history."

      "For someone who does not focus on literature, I can confidently say that this course was the best area studies course (Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia) I took at Harvard during my two–year master's program. Professor Gundorova's passion for Ukrainian literature and culture while also understanding Ukraine's historical, linguistic, and cultural complexities is unparalleled. Each assignment/reading was extremely engaging and related directly to our class discussion.  This course had an appropriate balance between the amount of student input and lectures from Professor Gundorova. Unlike some other area studies courses where students are asked to provide far too much feedback instead of the professor, this class was very well balanced. Professor Gundorova came wholly prepared for each lesson to place each piece of literature in the historical and cultural context, providing me with quintessential cultural and historical knowledge about Ukraine and the larger Soviet literature scene. The reading material was also very diverse, spanning classics of the early twentieth century to controversial modern pieces from 2024. Through these materials, we explored topics essential for students hoping to become experts on the region (usage of the Russian language in Ukraine, Soviet Ukrainian Experience, post–Soviet Ukrainian experience, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine from a cultural & historical perspective)."

Prof. Kremer has crafted a syllabus of readings, films, poems, etc. that are extremely interesting and approachable for a curious student. The topic is quite nuanced, and Prof. Kremer did an excellent job of progressively explaining it to students. The assignments are very fair & interesting, and Prof. Kremer is very accessible outside of class. At the end of the course, we watched a recent Oscar winning film about Poland and the Holocaust, and I was amazed that I understood so many of the themes, allusions, and references. I can't recommend enough for a student interested in this topic!"

      "The three Ukrainian courses, including this one, which I took during my MA, were my favorite courses. After one year, I went from speaking no Ukrainian to speaking at the advanced level. So, how was I able to make progress so quickly? Professor Shpylova–Saeed is the reason. She masterfully incorporates all the required elements of language instruction to ensure that her students are not only making incredible progress but also staying enticed in the cultural and historical elements of Ukraine. The structure of the course includes one weekly course in addition to a one–on–one meeting with Professor Shpylova Saeed. During the course lecture, students dissect a reading or multi–media exercise that they read/watch beforehand to practice spontaneous speech for nearly an hour and a half. However, the most important element is the one–on–one class session with Professor Shpylova–Saeed, where the student decides on the topic, including something they are researching, reading, or an element of the language that they are having a difficult time with. These sessions were critical for me to make the jump from limited to advanced proficiency in Ukrainian. Professor Shpylova–Saeed shows an incredible mastery of Ukrainian, providing the answer to nearly every question, from grammar to language style. Additionally, she is unparalleled in her passion for promoting Ukrainian culture, keeping all the students informed of any opportunities to continue their study of the language and culture. The best example of this dedication is Professor Shpylova–Saeed’s monthly Ukrainian club meetings that she organizes. She invites students of all levels of proficiency in Ukrainian and interest in the culture to discuss current topics related to Ukraine with some of the incredible staff and faculty at Harvard, like Serhii Plokhy and Tamara Hundorova. Professor Shpylova–Saeed also organized a Ukrainian dinner night where students got together and cooked all kinds of Ukrainian dishes! This class is a fantastic opportunity for all those hoping to make incredible improvements in their language ability and learn much more about Ukrainian culture than is possible in almost any other course at Harvard University. Even for those who might be struggling with the complexities of Ukrainian, I guarantee that Professor Shpylova–Saeed will provide the necessary tools and instruction to overcome any difficulties while also providing a profound understanding of Ukrainian culture and history."

I'd really use this class as a chance to explore your passion and find a specific interest within the education system. I also would take advantage of every assignment and guest speaker in the class to get the most out of it! The school visit assignment, in my perspective, was one of the best educational experiences I've had at Harvard or prior. This class is a must–take if you're truly interested in looking into urban schools and elements of segregation, school choice, and other important education–related topics (which you can find on the syllabus!)."

      "Terry is an amazing teacher and super super kind. He is so interested in his students and so encouraging. His feedback on essays is extremely thorough and he returns them incredibly (!!) quickly. The readings he selects are fantastic and he gives really helpful guidance on how to approach the readings. If you're interested in law, philosophy, political theory or anything remotely related to (any one of) those topics, this class would be worth taking. Strongly recommend. Don't be dissuaded by the midterm essay + final essay. While most other tutorials only have one final essay, they usually have weekly or biweekly assignments in addition to that. It all averages out to a roughly similar workload, and I actually preferred having two opportunities to write an essay and receive feedback."

Analyzing these intersections deepened my understanding of systemic inequalities. It sparked a passion for advocating for equitable healthcare, fundamentally changing my perspective and commitment to social justice. It did sometimes cover topics that I felt were quite obvious, but I felt like the point was to go into depth as to why these social beliefs or inequalities were common in society. The professor is cool and very engaging. The course is mildly fun. There are two exams and written final, at least in my year. I think I will end the course with a B+, and I did half of the readings. If you do the readings you will be fine. Make sure to define a lot of vocabulary words and try to understand the concepts. Ask Rachel for help if you need it. She was honestly one of my favorite TFs ever. She is so funny and understanding the fact that everyone is different. She is so down to earth. She is also a Mitski fan! I consider that a green flag."

Even if you aren't interested in sociology, we all interact with systems governing sex, gender, and sexuality daily, and I firmly believe understanding these systems will make you a better, more well–adjusted person. Professor Viterna is amazing and passionate, and will introduce you both to useful theories about S/G/S and cool studies supporting (or questioning) those theories. There are only five assignments and they are all writing–based, but the first two are pretty fun and the last three are all part of the final project. There are weekly readings and short in–class quizzes on the readings and lecture; overall they were very manageable, but there will be very long readings some weeks so I recommend checking the length earlier in the week so you don't get blindsided by a 60 page reading the day before class. Outside of readings and the 5 assignments, there are no tests or anything like that. There are a few drops for the in–class quizzes and the late policy is 2.5% off per day, which is pretty generous. Overall I would say this class is interesting, useful, fun, and on the easier side. Good way to get a divisional distribution, and you might walk away from it wanting a sociology secondary–––no reason not to take it!"

      "Now that I’ve finished all my courses at Harvard, I can say that this has been my favorite and probably the most influential course I’ve taken. Adaner has also been my favorite professor. The class was unlike any other. Lectures included a lot of discussions and questions from us students. By the third class (maybe even end of second) Adaner knew all of our names and it was always a very comfortable environment to ask questions / speak up in. The classroom was very small and centered around a large table; I got to know everyone in the class fairly well. This was all compounded by starting a few minutes late usually (so conversations beforehand always happened) and taking a 2–5 minute break in the middle of class, which was also awesome for other obvious reasons – I think almost all classes should have breaks. We would do a group stretch before breaking, too.The content was presented to us in such a logical way and really worked from ground zero up. Number–premise arguments are simply the best; Adaner uses them everywhere. The readings are really interesting, many are quite dense and tough but the general argument can be extracted without too much time and some skimming (which is what the weekly assignment is), and I didn’t always skim but sometimes I felt intellectually strained reading them and that they would require more time to get full value from, which I didn’t always have.The assignments were a ton of fun and really make you think, which should be the point – but they weren’t too time consuming. I do not think it is an understatement to say this class will have significantly altered the course of my life.  Take it! I'll end with this fact – not to flex, but to highlight how much I valued the course: for what I think is the first time, I did not miss a single class– I attended every single Tues/Thurs lecture, which took some luck but also just me wanting to come."

Still, Shai is very willing to engage in rich engaged conversation about the material and facilitates class discussion well — though this is a lecture class, I felt comfortable speaking up and my voice being heard and I didn’t really feel like any people dominated the conversation. This class requires very very little work—serious you can get away with skimming and doing 20 mins of discussion posts.

The homework is not too much and is the perfect amount where you stay engaged with the material without getting burnt out. Most of the learning happens from simply engaging with Richard Ji in class, which is definitely not difficult to do. He is a very engaging teacher, and everyone has fun in the class. If you’re thinking about any other language, just take Hindi. Also, don’t be afraid of the Urdu… learning Nastaliq script has been one of my favorite parts of the class. It really is not difficult when you are actually taught the script, which Richard Ji and Seton Ji do very well and slowly. You are expected to have some difficulty with it, so they don’t rush the learning process. In the end, it is really a cool skill to be able to read the script, especially because it is used in Arabic as well!"

This is my 6th semester taking Richard Delacy's classes, and he always does such a fantastic job at meeting each student at their own level and accelerating progress across both languages. I feel so honored to be his student, and would recommend the South Asian Studies department to anyone, whether a heritage speaker or totally new to the languages, whether your interest is in STEM, humanities, or linguistics itself–– take it!! Harvard is so lucky to have such a great program, it's truly quite rare."

      "I took this course to fulfill the Psych and Econ concentration requirements – it was very good, the content was relatable to a lot of different disciplines and Prof. McConville kept relating the things we learn to economists or psychologists or statisticians and how they may differently use/interpret some values. She's also generally an amazing and incredibly intelligent professor who constructs very informative lectures, presents the content in an engaging manner, and relates it to real–life data quite often. What I will suggest is that if you're an econ–psy double concentrator and have the space, it might be better to take STAT 104 and PSY 1900 at different points – not because there's anything wrong with this course but because it's just SO broad. It covers a lot of things, and if you're interested in learning to code in R and learning to interpret hypotheses/p–values/z–scores/distributions etc., this course is an amazing start, but if you want to do research in any or both of those areas, it might be better to take the stat class catered towards particularly that (it's also usually a pre–req to have taken STAT 104 to apply to some econ RA positions for example, but not always). Also, the psets can be a little bit long but there are a lot of office hours throughout the week, great TF's, and the long psets are generally helpful for gaining a greater understanding of the content. In general, I really enjoyed this class especially because I like coding and found R to be fun (generally),  and also because Prof McConville is a very good professor! So take this class if you want to do a Stat secondary, want to get a broad introduction to statistics (in a more coding–heavy manner), or want to fulfill a requirement for a concentration that you're not necessarily planning on doing research in (but even if you are, I know tons of people that took STAT100 and went on to do psych research or ec research– it's just a bit harder sometimes bc they have prereqs)."

Nobody told me this and I went in thinking that it would be a medium difficult class but I honestly found it to be much harder than that. For sure the first two psets are super easy but don't doubt the next ones. Attend office hours and if you are taking 5 course, please set time to study for this class! I made the mistake of not attending office hours, section times, and it costed me on the midterm and some of the psets.  Before taking this class, please consider brushing up on AP stats and perhaps some basic mathematical concepts like algebra. You don't need much but you need to have the understanding when performing these calculations. Professor Rader is a very good professor I just wish this course offered more office hours considering that each office hour is 1 hour long and you have one long study session which is around 2 hours and a half. That doesn't give enough time for someone to ask proper questions. I did however learn a lot and I will be taking this further. Do not be discouraged because of the midterm result. Just push through, try to make friends, and ask questions. (Do practice problems on your own and please, if you going to take this class, STUDY)"

Notice that the first couple weeks of the class were unbareably hard because of its long psets. I had an amazing schedule. I was waking up at 7, sleeping at 12, etc. I was on top of my game! I was doing all the readings for my classes. I was writing my reading responses with so much attention to detail. Then, the third and forth psets came in. They hit me like a truck! I pulled an all nighter for each of the psets even though I put in 50 hours a week for my classes overall. The ripples from those all–nighters made my whole semester miserable. Because I pulled an all–nigher, my other work had to be delayed. Then, the work after that got delayed. Stat 111 caused a domino effect that ruined my semester. I unequivically blame Stat 111. I have no extracurricular activities. The ones I was in, I gave up on ALL of them, just to be able to keep up with myy classes. How can a pset for a class take ~20 hours to finish? None of the CS124 psets took that long. I got an A in Stat 110 and in 111.  The concepts in both I love and I have covered somewhat before because of math olympiad. I got the psets done. Every week. I pulled back–to–back all–nighters because I am not a quitter. But the psets were simply too tedious for the first 4 weeks. Legend has it that one of those weeks, MORE THAN HALF of the class had not submitted the pset by the deadline and took the extension. I was determined to not take them since I knew that my second half of semester would be even worse (it was worse indeed). Because of this, apparently, Joe decided to give everyone an extra extension. IT DOES NOT HELP to make the course lighter after the fact. I couldn’t care less about the easier weeks afterwards because they are not the issue here.Make the time commitment an even 13, heck an even 16, but do not make it 27 hours one week and 7 some other week. I pulled a total of 7 all–nighters for this class. Having done all those all–nighters, I think my life was shortened measurably. I think I might have killed millions of neurons in pursuit of perfection in this class. I blame myself for creating my schedule first, but then I blame Stat 111 next. In total, I spent 169 hours on this class. With that, this class takes third place among all the classes I’ve taken with CS61 and CS124 coming in first and second with 196 hours and 180 hours total respectively. If the course continues like this next year, please use your extensions on the earlier, tedious psets. The later psets, as seen in the data, are relatively fine. Anyways, how to do well in the class? Know stat 110 well. Know your conjugacies, know your pdfs, know the properties of the distributions you’ll be working with. Memoryless property, chicken–egg etc. Read the stat 111 textbook (a new addition to the course this year). The textbook is amazing. It has too much info that is not all relevant to the class.  But the textbook is a superset of the class. Read the book and the lectures will become review. If you read the textbook, you’ll also see special derivation etc. that will give you new methods of problem solving for the psets. You better go into the class with a pset group. My god was it necessary. You should to be able to talk through problems and ideate. Going to OH for every question is hard. Collaboration within the confines of the collaboration policy is key. The TFs are nitpicky. The grading RUBRIC is nitpicky. The psets were graded out of 48 for most psets and each question has an excrutiating amoung of subparts. Each subpart is worth, say 1 point. YOU WILL LOSE 0.5 of that for the smallest of reasons. Note that your psets are worth 45% of your grade and so each pset is almost 5% of the grade. Be as perfectionist as possible. Double proofread just to make sure. The smallest things! Because of the denominator, each small loss adds up quickly and suddenly you might find yourself with whole percentage points lost on your final grade because of silly mistakes. A friend of mine experienced this. I repeat, BE PERFECTIONIST. There are exponentially diminishing marginal benefits to another round of checking your pset. But you do want to get an A, right? So buckle up and do it. I did not go to a single lecture for the class. Totally unnecessary. Watch them all online. I have a panopto extension that allows me to watch the lectures at arbitrary speeds. Watch it at a speed comfortable to you. I watched at 2.5–3.5x speed. Frequently stop the lecture and take notes. That way, it will come out to be about 1–1.5x speed still, but you will get a series of notes out of it. On that note, please take notes. It helps a lot with review and you better believe you will need that review material come midterm and final season. This class, similar to Stat 110, is extremely well staffed. The stat department is really good at this (at least for 110 and 111). There are office hours in convenient times and locations almost all days. Even as a quadling, I had access to 4 different office hours in 4 different nights. Thanks here to Jamie, Nick, Shea, and other TFs that I am currently unable to remember on the plane. Tips for R, LaTeX and submissions:For R:Learn how to vectorize everything! It significantly increases your productivity and reduces execution time. Functions such as replicate, sapply, lapply together with anonymous functions are VERY helpful for coding up stuff. Watch some tutorials and it will pay dividends as the semester goes along. There will be a lot of times where you will have to do some calculation/data generation and then repeat it for some B times. I recommend writing a function that does the procedure for one iteration of it and then using the replication/application functions mentioned above to process it for the total B times. Ends up being very clean and fast code. Learn to use the documentation. Use ChatGPT for your graphing needs. You have the data, let GPT handle the specific code needed to display it well.  R Studio:Its a piece of S**t. Compared to VSCode, it is garbage. But you are sort of stuck with it. I explored running R in VSCode, in NVim, etc. None are as good imo. LEARN THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS. Please! I cringe everytime someone manually goes to the beginning of a line to change that line to a comment. Use Ctrl+Shift+C instead. Learn how to copy and past whole lines and reorder them with just alt lol. If you have the time, change the shortcuts to those you are familiar with. This will noticably improve your quality of life. When you're close to the deadline, the last thing you want is for your progress to be halted by R Studio. How to put code in your pdfs? Here's my process. I hated R Studio, so I only used it to **write** my R code and test it. Once done, I used RTEX to compile my final doc. I use a VSCode extension called LaTeX Workshop to compile latex on my local computer (eliminates reliance on janky harvard wifi and Overleaf). This extension can be used to write rtex files as well. The workflow goes as follows: Download that week's pset. Optionally generate a pdf for my ipad with more spacing between questions to handwrite some answers. Copy the .tex file into a separate folder and name it with the .rtex extension instead. copy over csv files and resources that the .tex file needs to the same folder. Whenever I want to insert R code, I write the following incantation: <<cache=TRUE>>= [MANY LINES OF R CODE HERE]@.The extension neatly runs the code and plugs in both the result and the code into the pdf file. Super convenient. The cache=TRUE allows for computation to not be repeated for each LaTeX compilation round since simulations can take some time to finish.  It only reruns if you change the code withing the incantation. Writing latex itself is slow and so I try to write in the fastest medium. Questions about explaining intuition are done in RTeX. Questions about code get done in RStudio and then the code gets copy–pasted into Rtex as well. Having done the pset, the pdf generated in computer is sent to ipad for final assembly with handwritten answers. Never had an issue with using handwritten submissions for some questions/parts.Midterm stats: Direcly from Joe: mean = 67, SD = 22. (first quartile, median, third quartile) = (52, 70, 85)Final Stats not released. I feel stockholm syndrome from this class. It might have convinced me to do stat AB/AM instead of the CS AB/SM. See my other reviews for the many woes of the CS department. The concepts you learn here are invaluable. Together with Stat 110, this class has literally changed the way I think and my everyday language. Cs124 was tedious too, but also almost nothing from it stayed with me. Stat 111 though, has changed the way I have discussions with my friends. The concept of conditioning is really the soul of statistic and perhaps rational judgement itself. Not to get to philosophical here, but this class will change how you think, period. Do I recommend the class? You bet I do. Suffer through it and come out the other end a new person. Battle scarred, but a veteran. I wish you serenity for the many frustrations you will experience with the class and for the many all–nighters you might embark on. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world."

      "Because this is the first iteration of the class, it was quite disorganized: the lecture schedule changed, the assignment number changed, there were unexpected hurdles, etc. BUT James tried really really hard to circumvent that and help students learn as much as possible about bioinformatics. A lot of things went well and a lot of important concepts were taught well, some less so but the feedback about that was requested and well received so it is very likely that things will be better next year. James and Jay both worked very hard to help students and it was very clear how much they cared about the course. James is always around in his office meeting with students and helping. He's very accessible and open to feedback. He's also very competent, friendly, and approachable. I recommend as a bioinformatics course but honestly the more stat you took, the more you'll get out of this course. If you never took 111 or 139 you will have some catching up to do but it's definitely feasible."

      "This is a great course but with reservations. I had super high expectations coming in but some weren't met. Let's start with the pros: Giovanni is truly a great instructor and he is extremely qualified and renowned in his field. The TFs are usually life–savers when it comes to doing the homeworks and the project so please use them as a resource!! You will learn a lot in this course about biostatistics and biomarker research. But! If you expect to come out of it an expert on the topic such that you could confidently and extensively analyze a biomarker dataset without any mistakes or questions, you likely will be mistaken. There are lots of times in class when things went over my head and my biggest qualm is that many important concepts were not mentioned in the notes but only brought up verbally or on the board in class so if you didn't listen/show up that day/take notes, you will not learn them. Or even if you did, you might not remember them later. Especially if you didn't super understand it at that very moment. The bad news is you will not be able to understand every little concept that is brought up on an intuitive level. Some things will go over your head. The good news is you can still do super well (A) in the course even if you don't understand every little concept extremely well.  This doesn't mean you won't learn a lot, you absolutely will, but I am just the kind of person that likes to learn 100% of every concept and never leave a class feeling like there was a concept that I don't intuitively understand. Also some kids will have taken other higher level stat courses like 181 and sometimes, even though they're not required, some concepts from these courses will be brough up and you'll be expected to know them. This is easily resolved with a google search but you should know it going in. Tbh, it's a great choice for people interested in bioinformatics/biostatistics who have taken 110,111, and 139. I just think it's only fair that you know what to expect going in."

      "The course is OK. I wouldn't really recommend it if you're seriously seeking to expand your ML knowledge. I don't think I really got anything out of the course. Here's a breakdown: Assignments: Most of the course grade is determined by homeworks. There's only 5 homeworks in total and you get a drop which is nice. In terms of workload, the class shouldn't be super stressful if you start the problem sets early (which I didn't always do). The problem sets, though, can be quite difficult, since they're don't involve problems that directly relate to what's covered in lecture. You'll have to rely on prior stat knowledge to complete them. I would recommend going to OH, but it's probably better to just have a pset buddy or two to do the problem sets with. In OH, they're aren't too helpful to be honest. You also have to make sure that your derivations and proofs are fairly rigorous to get full points. I didn't really do that and lost a good couple of points on each homework. The hardest problems on the psets are definitely the No Free Lunch problems, which honestly felt a bit tedious. I don't think I too much away from them. The other main assignments is the course project, which consists of 3 parts: 2 presentations on an ML paper (one applied and one theoretical). Then, you have a 3–page final paper where you propose an improvement to the applied paper. You also have an oral exam at the end where the course staff asks you questions about your final paper. The project is light, but it should be taken fairly seriously if you want to do well. I wrote my final paper in a day and was not prepared for the oral exam at all. Make sure you actually think seriously about it and prepare for the oral exam (which isn't particularly hard, but you actually need to know specific details about the methods you are proposing, you can't just BS it) Lectures: Lectures are also OK. If you're really interested in the theoretical basis behind ML, then you'll find it interesting, but I honestly didn't pay attention to any of the lectures past week 3 and I was doing fine on the problem sets. Overall: I came into this course thinking it would give me much more background on supervised learning in ML (specifically deep learning), but it didn't. I felt that most of the course was just tedious work and I didn't really learn anything from it. Other courses I was considering on taking in place of this one was STAT 171, and if you have the option, I would def choose 171 over this. If you want to take something ML related, then I would definitely just go to MIT. Harvard ML courses just miss the mark for some reason (even though our STAT department is really good, we just don't teach ML from enough of a practical perspective)."

      "One of the best courses I have ever taken! ~ course material ~The class was a very well–taught introduction to probability theory and a glimpse of some cool ideas beyond. It begins with some basic concepts from stat 210 with some more rigor (e.g., review of conditional expectation and convergence theorems); then, one discusses the Martingale Convergence theorem, uniform integrability, and convergence in L^p spaces. The classic 0–1 laws are discussed, with applications, e.g. in LLN or U–statistics; exchangeability is introduced. Some concentration inequalities (azuma, efron–stein) are proven. The first half of the course then ends with the martingale CLT, which is quite a cool result! The second half then begins with a discussion of Brownian Motion (intro, construction, uniqueness, properties), etc. One then moves to Stein's method. Finally, there is a final project, in which one reads a paper (typically somewhat recent research output), and gives a presentation. Overall, the material is quite fun, and there are a lot of cool theorems and proof methods!~ comments ~The course is organized in a very good manner, as to provide both fundamentals and a bit of an idea of the field. Most courses tend to do only one of the two (or neither). However, the basic material (first half and BM) are done fairly rigorously; occasionally measure theory is swept under the rug, but it can be justified with some (and not too great) effort. The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course–time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters–Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly 'Fundamentals on Stein's Method' (cf. arxiv) provides rigor for the Stein's method parts. I find that the very important fundamentals are done quite rigorously and well; some results are introduced to give a sense of what types of results have been proven, and this latter type is usually not justified, but rather intuition (which is good) is provided. The lecturing is fantastic. The usual way I like lectures to go is to either (1) explicate the material in a clear and engaging manner or (2) provide some intuition otherwise not found. These are both done; the first half of the course especially, Morgane encourages participation and engagement by asking questions about how to proceed; following closely in the course was helpful both in understanding the proofs better and being able to come up with and understand the main techniques of proof (e.g., 'definitions!'). Lecturing speed varies; I found that it started quite quickly and then in the end slowed down a bit. As noted in the last paragraph, I think intuition for the unproven results provided was very useful, whereas the basic facts were justified rigorously (and for these, the intuition often comes from going through the basic ideas and really thinking about the math over and over again). The assignments are fairly chill and fun. There are about 5 HW assignments, with one drop; there are a large number of additional problems and HWs which are very useful when studying the exam or for gaining more familiarity with the concepts (so one has enough problems to work with, but there is minimal stress). The final project was a fun way to see what sort of methods and ideas are being researched in probability (e.g., random matrix theory, Stein's method, etc.). Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to comprehend the presentations, but I enjoyed it because one gains a viewpoint of how the course can lead to later research. Now, a few miscellaneous comments — the exams are not easy, but contain many fun problems. Studying is certainly necessary but the review process is helpful in going through the main ideas of the course, and there are a number of problems and past finals which are enjoyable (there are a lot of 'cute' problems). I would advise one to read the reference materials, both for review purposes, and because they are good classics, which provide a lot of extras (concepts or 'measure theory' etc!) Lastly, Morgane is very approachable outside of class; I went to a few office hours to ask questions, in addition to our final project meeting. She provides helpful wisdom, both in respect to the main concepts of the course as well as life advice, e.g. experiences in grad school, which I appreciate. I came into this semester with a heavy math background and stat 210 deciding that I wanted a change from heavily abstract mathematics to learn more stats — this course has genuinely built my enjoyment and interest in probability and was important in helping me settle my focus in the field; in this way it has been a very important course for my personal path. It also has provided a satisfyingly large collection of resources for further exploration (e.g., there are the three course references mentioned; a collection of papers from final projects, resources for random matrix theory, etc.). If you are considering this course, definitely take it!"

      "This is a tremendous, fantastic course. ~ content ~The class goes through a lot of content. The first two weeks are really easy. The basics of Bayes' method, prior/posterior, posterior predictive distribution, etc., and examples are covered (Beta–binomial, Gamma–Poisson). Do not be fooled! The class gets much more interesting (and difficult) thereafter. One–parameter methods (the aforementioned and Gaussian) are discussed, then multivariate models (in particular, the normal unknown–means, unknown–variance, unknown mean–variance problem in one and multiple dimensions); Bayesian linear regression, one lecture on decision theory. Prior choice is discussed, including the noninformative and Jeffreys priors, as well as some special priors (e.g., spike–and–slab, improper). The Dirichlet–multinomial model is discussed, then nonparametric methods and Dirichlet processes; then, mixture models and hierarchical models. The class concludes with discussing model choice (quite important), e.g. the AIC/BIC/DIC/WAIC amongst other methods, and variational approximation methods. Along the way, sampling and MCMC methods (importance, rejection, Metropolis–Hastings, Gibbs sampling) are introduced and used extensively. The content is interesting, and as one can see very thorough. Also, though there are a lot of concepts covered, they are covered each quite extensively, in that details and all the complicated derivations are done fully rigorously and correctly. ~ comments ~Jun is terrific. This course is not known for having the best q–guide reviews. Perhaps the reason for this is one part of Jun's philosophy, which carries over to the course: that the ugly stuff matters in the long run, that one has to do ugly math and ugly coding to get to the real stuff. This is true. And it is reflected in the course — the normal–inverse–chi–squared prior has a PDF which is an entire line long, many derivations run across the page, and the final project had many expressions which were *multiple* lines long and amounted to ~1000+ lines of code. I personally find this very valuable. In a sense, in a class which teaches both the theory and the application properly, the application has to be nontrivial. I think working through a lot of the expressions really improved my ability to do both arduous statistical calculation and especially linear algebra bashes (e.g., multivariate Gaussian and completing the square for quadratic forms became familiar), as well as understand this philosophical point. There are a lot of really clean priors which might be fun and not so applicable, and knowing the entire toolkit and being able to work something out which is accurate on the spot is very important. The experience of working through the calculations and the code really helped me gain a solid understanding of the material. Moreover, not all of the material is ugly — for instance, the first few lecture, the decision theory part, asymptotics and the information criteria, regression, EM, etc. are often the product of one or two clean and very nice ideas. The ideas throughout are nice, and the details are there out of necessity — in a certain sense, the course is all an application of Bayes' theorem (which is very simple)! I would also comment that philosophically, Bayesian statistics is quite attractive, because I personally find probability and statistics to serve the fundamental goal of modeling uncertainty, and Bayesian methods, by offering a posterior *distribution*, are able to do this effectively.The assignments are pretty good. I appreciated the ones that involved coding up samplers in particular, because they were very good practice for implementation.  There were also some problems which involved working in greater detail out things in the course — these problems were also good. Sometimes the BDA problems are a bit weird though, and confusing — I would suggest replacing some of these problems with problems of the aforementioned type. Also, sometimes the datasets which BDA work with are cool but it is hard to get intuition for them and/or they do not feel as important. I appreciate, however, working with these real datasets, which definitely taught me a lot (perhaps different ones can be used though). The course notes are really terrific. I basically now possess a 187 page document of summarial concepts in Bayesian statistics done with sufficient detail (in the places where detail is not provided, one can complete the proofs with what is given). They are genuinely one of the best sets I've seen, and while they occasionally have small typos (also the \\ref{} and \\cite{} do not always work), 99% of the time they are an excellent supplement. Also, they provide a LARGE number of references to papers. I did not have the time to read all of this, but now I just have a collection of things to read in my free time which are either relevant or foundational to Bayesian statistics (many important papers were referenced), or specific and interesting (including a good number of post 2010 results). The references are great! Jun's OH is fun. I went a few times, and he provides both helpful guidance to the material in the course as well as philosophical discussion of Bayesian methods. He is also very approachable after class to ask for clarification or intuition about the material. ~ the FINAL PROJECT ~ I cannot discuss the course without mentioning the final project which, well, is perhaps genuinely the most difficult short–term projects I have ever tried to do. I think I probably spent over 50 hours working on it, and produced over 20 pages of submission (including figures). Even so I omitted more details, and in a certain sense the project (if someone with more bio intuition were to do the statistics and then elaborate on the biological consequences) could be a miniature thesis. It would be an understatement to say that it was an effort. A serious one. It was worthwhile though — really working with a nontrivial dataset (30k x 268 size; even reducing the size means it is a real dataset) was an important experience. You learn the power of metropolis–hastings and gibbs, and you understand what real Bayesian statisticians do (at least, you get a glimpse of it), you find a lot of odd phenomena which you then realize, which are not immediately obvious from the theory, and you learn to not be afraid of working on any such project again. You realize, when working, how much there is to real experience in the field, and you realize that there is much you don't know, but when your sampler works, then it feels amazing. You feel a bit like a statistics monk (I can pretty easily count how many times I left my room). I remember feeling in–the–zone at some point, in a way I had not felt in a long time, feeling like high–school me being really focused, which provided a rather beautiful work highlight of the semester. From a practical standpoint it is also a bit of a stressful project, in that it took up essentially all of reading week. It was a worthwhile experience and genuinely a great learning effort, but also one should be good at balancing time (study for your other finals earlier, or just spend a bit less time, etc — I was basically in my room after that). Lastly, the grading on it was not terrible, as is the grading throughout the class — a good summary is that the tasks are difficult, but if you accomplish them, your grade will be totally fine. ~ advice ~Overall, this class has laid a good foundational understanding of Bayesian statistics, from the most basic of theorems, Bayes' theorem, and provide a comprehensive view towards a beautiful field — as well as implementation of these methods — and I would advise those considering to take it!"

      "Stat 291 is definitely one of the hardest and one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.

Mark is so knowledgeable about the content from the class, and, other than occasional mistakes on the board, his lectures are as clear as possible (it seems impossible for anyone to lecture completely clearly on some of the topics). If you've taken/are taking/will be taking Stat 217, Stat 291 is a really nice complement to the course: knowing basic information about RSB is really helpful for the latter part of Stat 291, and Stat 291 helps fill in some of the gaps in rigor from the Stat 217 heuristics. Strong probability and math/analysis is a must for the class, and knowing some differential geometry is really helpful for understanding a lot of the math."

      "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. It is genuinely everything that you can ask for from a Harvard class. First of all, Sergio is one of the best human beings I have ever met in my life. He is the kindest, most attentive, most fascinating, and most engaging teacher that I have had the honor of meeting. To put things into perspective, he wrote EVERY SINGLE STUDENT in a 70+ student class a personalized, handwritten note at the end of the semester and got us all SCRB 120 T–shirts. His final lecture about his personal moral philosophies and perspectives towards biotech ethics was truly one of the most heartwarming and emotional lectures that I've ever heard. He is enough reason for you to take this class. He is captivating, and you can't help but give your 100% attention to him when he speaks. Sergio cares so much about each and every one of his students and is genuinely one of the best that Harvard has to offer.Secondly, the course content is absolutely vital for anyone with an interest in pursuing a career in science, biotech, or medicine. Very rarely do we have the opportunity to engage so freely and openly about the ethical questions that govern biotech advancements, and as someone with a hard science background, thinking about philosophy and morality was a very new perspective that opened so many doors for me. It's an incredible opportunity to grow as a student in a holistic fashion, and you really begin to think carefully about what the future of biotech will entail and how you will be playing an active role in shaping that future. We talk about so many beyond fascinating topics, and I found myself immensely excited for every single lecture.If you're hesitating between taking this class or not, please take it! I promise you that you will not be disappointed. It's also very very light workload–wise, just a few short weekly readings and a discussion post. The case studies are also really chill — they're essentially just in–class conversations that are graded. It's a super low–stakes way to learn about such important topics with genuinely one of the best professors you'll have the honor of meeting."

      "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Prepare to have your mind–blown every second!!! I left every single lecture with a new appreciation for how amazing biology is and raved to my friends about what I was learning. I cannot recommend this course enough!!!Even things that seemed dull like HPG axis became super interesting. Professor McKinley has amazing slides and is super engaging, so you will come away with a great understanding of the material. We talked about how disease manifests in patients, scientific studies that were fundamental to our understanding of the biological process, as well as bit of epidemiology and ethics/history. I think about the HPG every day when I take my birth control. I wish someone had explained it earlier, but better late than never I guess. Come to class every day, pay attention, ask questions, it is worth waking up for :)PSETs really are doable on your own but start early. For the trickier questions, it’s good to sleep on it. There are a not a lot of assignments so put your best foot forward on these. Professor McKinley has a zero–bullshit attitude that I really appreciated. It meant the course was rigorous (in terms of meaningful scientific thinking) without being too difficult.Start thinking of ideas for the final project early!!!!! You will have to iterate a lot and it will be discouraging but once you find something that works you will write an incredible proposal and give a fire presentation and truly will feel so much pride for how far you have come. The course staff is super encouraging throughout so you will overcome initial bumps in the road…I wish I had put more effort into preparing for fishbowl. Basically you get a list of words and you should know a definition for it to play “taboo” in class. It was easy to “get by” if you knew associated things without really knowing the meaning of the word itself, but it meant some words never really got learned. You get out what you put in.The guest speakers are AMAZING!!!! I learned about so much amazing cutting–edge research (shout out to Smita Gopinath and her lecture about the vaginal microbiome!!! Literally rocked my world). Professor McKinley is super well–connected in the reproductive biology world and brings world–class scientists, ethicists and physicians to speak with the class. Her own research had it’s own lecture dedicated to it, and literally my JAW DROPPED. It is so cool and will change lives one day.The TFs are super supportive and knowledgeable. If you come in with less of a biology background (eg, not a SCRB concentrator) they are really open to helping you catch up. Be sure to pay attention to the first couple lectures about scientific methods and genetics since those are important to the PSET, do the practice PSETs and come to office hours to check your work on it to address areas of misunderstanding. An early investment here will pay off the rest of the course.I literally would enroll in this class again if I could. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE EVERY SECOND. Makes me feel lucky to get to go to Harvard and learn from such amazing faculty <3"

      "The small seminar style class allows us to get to know everyone well :)Professor Camargo is also very accomplished in his field and has awesome connections. The guest lecturers he brings in are very diverse and interesting. However, I would note that since this course is a seminar style, there is less of a structure to the class for good or for worse. Professor Camargo is very open to questions, so don't be afraid to ask. Professor Camargo and Marco are both extremely approachable :) Also, note that you should know, or plan to learn, to write a research proposal (SCRB 50 helps) and lead paper discussions (SCRB10 helps with preparing paper reading skills)The Spring 2024 class is majority seniors + graduate student. If you're planning to take this course as a sophomore, you might feel a little behind on the material and skills needed for this course. You'll love this course! There's only 2 paper discussion assignments to do outside of class and those can be time consuming, but on a normal week, the class does not take much time"

      "This class is AMAZING!  This is (probably) the best class on epigenetics offered anywhere in the world. I would also say it is the best class I've taken at harvard so far. This class offers incredible breadth and depth in epigenetics–it is comprehensive in its coverage of fundamental biology, cutting edge techniques (a lot of sequencing), and unique experimental design. Moreover, we learn a bunch about modern day computational biology workflows through weekly computational sections.  Lastly, it is so cool that the class is taught by the scientist who actually kickstarted much of modern epigenetics research through his invention of ATAC–seq. Jason is so incredibly knowledgeable on the field that he is able to provide a question on ANY question asked in the class, even if it is tangentially related to the specific material on the slides. He is also super chill and awesome in general. Emily and Ena are also some of the funniest, kindest,  caring, and most helpful TFs I've had in any class."

It's intellectually interesting, with diverse scientific topic coverage, clear and helpful course materials, and several well–spaced assignments that are academically engaging but not too high–stress. Ryan's lectures, in particular, are awesome, as he's a clear and natural speaker who is also obviously a young leader in his field and knows an incredible amount about this subject. Whatever scientific topics in biology/biochemistry that you're interested in will probably be in here somewhere, because RNA is everywhere. Selection effects lead to a very chill and smart cohort of students who are willing to get up early enough for 9:00AM lectures at Sherman Fairchild. Ryan and Petar are both legends.

      "This course was a really fantastic introduction to stem cells, the diseases they treat, and the patients these diseases impact. The most valuable portion of each lecture is the patient presentation, in which we see how a disease and its treatment uniquely impact the individual and their quality of life. Most presenters were compelling, as well, with some variation from week to week. The section portion of the course involves student presentation of assigned papers and discussion. The papers selected each week tended to be very strong, though I do wish some were more recent. Assignments are not at all painful and entail: a short weekly write–up, one presentation in section, a final paper (divided into an introduction, midterm, and final over the semester). Feedback on the midterm paper, which includes the instructors, was mixed. Be prepared for feedback that doesn't address the salience of your argument, but the beliefs of the instructors on whether the argument is sensible. This is a bit frustrating, as the feedback doesn't require elaboration or evidence; thus, you might hear \"X won't work\" with very little explanation. The feedback from the section leaders, conversely, was all very helpful! They tended to focus on weaknesses of the argument and its organization with clear suggestions for improvement. Be sure to meet with your TF about the papers before submission. They are very willing to help. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an introduction to stem cells! It isn't perfect, but the unique focus on the patient experience is incredibly valuable and not something that many students get the chance to experience during undergrad."

      "What an amazing course!! For this being the first time Arlotta and Hyman taught this course, they did a phenomenal job. They also cultivated one of the best teaching teams I've experienced so far. My tf, Sebastion M, in particular really made section engaging and did a great job of breaking down complicated topics from lecture. It was also really cool to have a psychiatrist on the team who floated through some of the sections to share info and receive questions based on her expertise. The class combined topics from neuroethics, genetics, brain development, autism, and schizophrenia in such a cohesive and meaningful way.  I also enjoyed most of the guest speakers for the class who added unique perspectives to the material. My only critique of the course is that the exams were a little too long for the time allotted and the expected breadth of responses. There also wasn't much to buffer our grade which added to exam stress :( I also think some of the readings were a little too dense/technical for this to be a class for students without required biology backgrounds; however, lecture helped a lot with this. Additionally, I hope they cap the enrollment for this course next time to enable better class discussion in lectures. The profs spent practically all of the last lecture just listening to feedback from students, so I truly believe they are willing and ready to adapt to make this course even better. Overall, this is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in psychology, neuroscience, or the ethical considerations for related topics! :)"

There also wasn't much to buffer our grade which added to exam stress :( I also think some of the readings were a little too dense/technical for this to be a class for students without required biology backgrounds; however, lecture helped a lot with this. Additionally, I hope they cap the enrollment for this course next time to enable better class discussion in lectures. The profs spent practically all of the last lecture just listening to feedback from students, so I truly believe they are willing and ready to adapt to make this course even better. Overall, this is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in psychology, neuroscience, or the ethical considerations for related topics! :)"

It is best for those people who either want to get something started off from the ground or want to go through the thought experiment of entrepreneurship. For those who already have a business started and need more specific advice or guidance, there are other classes that could potentially be a better fit (unless this class changes its structure). There are opportunities to pitch, write your own business plan, and talk to many impressive entrepreneurs. Also, the people made this class. All of my peers were working on incredible ideas and it was privilege to learn among them. The environment is fun, thoughtful, and non–judgmental. One of my best experiences at Harvard!"

He doesn't go overboard by making you comment on each other's posts or anything, but you do have to do reading–log type assignments every week on some pretty dense theatre theory texts. I enjoyed this a lot, and it's a requirement for majors. I found that the reading–log posts (answer a couple questions from the readings) were on the whole really chill and helpful in remembering what I read. He graded them pretty much for completion as long as you showed you read it from your answers. Then in lecture he would ask the exact same questions so you could just read off the post if you're nervous or forgot, which I think is a plus. Every lecture he recaps what happened last time in case you missed or just spaced out or had a follow up question, which is very helpful. He will also work really hard to spin whatever you said into the correct answer, and isn't trying to quiz you or make your life harder. He even brings snacks because seminar is so long (almost 3 hours aaaaa). Also they took us on a field trip to New York where we got to tour the MET and see a Broadway show & they paid for our meals and overnight stay, which was amazing."

Take it for a different sort of challenge. Not the sort of challenge you get from psets or essays, but a challenge nonetheless. You'll have to tap into your creativity (which, if you're like me, you haven't done in a while). You'll have to create and memorize movements and lines and cues as part of performances. You'll have to share those performances with an audience of your peers. None of that is easy. But it is a different sort of challenge. One that will refresh you. One that will stretch your mind in a different sort of way, creating more room for the psets and essays and the like. You'll meet genuine people who are attracted to this sort of space; the sort where you can be comfortable. Comfortable being weird and silly. Comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone. A space where judgment is suspended for the sake of exploring, investigating, pursuing, striving for art. I'm glad I took this course. It was anxiety–inducing and nerve–wracking at times. Performance is always that way, at least at first. But I gained more confidence and new insights into how my body can move and communicate. This is a great way to balance out the schedule in a way that maintains intellectual engagement."

The class requires humility and a sincere openness. If you can manage that, it'll be amazing and you'll get a lot out of it. The class mimics the structure of a real–life TV writers room. You and your peers are given space to establish the creative norms of the room. Thus, the class really is what you make it. You work with your peers on original work and receive feedback from each other and the instructor. The instructor also brings in a lot of great guest writers from a ton of different genres to talk to you. He puts a lot of thought into exposing you to great work by great writers. He also asks the students for their art recommendations and treats these with equal reverence. The instructor is fantastic – one of the best creatives at Harvard. The entire curriculum is designed to hold dignity and respect above all else in the writers room – pretty cool. He's very honest about the television industry in a way that's refreshing to hear.  His teaching style is unconventional, and does not follow the traditional workshop set–up. He will encourage you to stretch your writing and try new things. If you want to grow, you'll love it. If you're just looking for a space to get feedback on whatever show you've already created in your head, you probably won't."

Although it is a survey class, and many weeks you will read excerpts rather than the whole work, it is still quite intensive! The workload and time commitment is certainly manageable, but because the class meets once a week for nearly 3 hours, our conversations can get really deep and still require ample effort/preparation. Nonetheless, it is structured so some weeks will be heavier than others, so if you need a break, you will get one some weeks. If you are passionate about Asian/Pacific/Asian American history and Asian/American women's history, this class will be very enjoyable and fruitful for you. It is a great way to gain exposure to more writers, learn about history/imperialism/misogyny/modernization, and build up your back pocket of works you are able to reference. Professor Choi is very knowledgable on the topic and has high expectations for you, even though she will adjust the course to help you succeed! Even though it is a chill and understanding class (as many WGS classes are), Prof. Choi still makes discussions very deep and you will have to read actively! There are not many assessments, which I really enjoyed, besides the big final project, which can be as inventive as you like. I don't think you'll regret taking this class, but it's also not a must–take! Very useful nonetheless to expose urself to more authors"

      "I took this class because of the rave reviews from past years; however, I realized the class was overwhelmingly – blonde – meaning that this course was the first time many students were engaging with discussion on oppression, privilege, color, intersectional feminism, poverty, etc. I loved that the survey nature of the course spanned a variety of topics, including neoliberalism, 'third world feminism,' carceral feminism, ecofeminism, women in poverty... but it definitely moved so fast that if a week interested you, you would likely have to move on from it quickly. So, I would say take the course at your discretion and for the right purpose. You won't deep dive into theory, although there are academic readings, but you will touch on them briefly and be able to add the reading to your pocket to build on it later. Professor Thompson is an amazing and compelling lecturer, and she puts together a mean slidedeck! Some lectures flew by because they were just so interesting. It's an incredibly fast–paced class though, so keep that in mind as well. I didn't like that we would have really long weekly discussion posts sometimes that would pretty much be left at that, and because section was so brief we didn't have much time to talk about our reactions to the readings. I wish I had realized this fact earlier on, and learned to treat the class more like the survey course it is. Overall, I'd recommend taking the class, but it's not a must–take as the other comments will make it sound. (If you take any other ethnic studies/womgen class you'll probably encounter the most important readings, and TBH as I stated earlier, you'll probably get the same result from taking the class as taking the syllabus and just doing the readings on your own.) No complaints at all on the teaching staff though! They are an awesome team (I loved the weeks that the TFs led their own lectures on their research interests), but I will say the class will be influenced heavily by the demographic of the students/the ones in your section."

      "This is an absolutely brilliant class. You will come out of every class meeting feeling like you've learned something, and you'll be genuinely excited for this class even though it keeps you in school until nearly 9 pm. Professor Albert is incredibly smart, kind, and effective at their job, leaving every one of their students feeling valued and prioritized. The course readings are engaging and genuinely fun to read, which is really saying something in a reading–heavy course like this one. Take this class, take this class, take this class. Take this class if you've never taken anything in WGS (trust me), take this class if you don't know a single thing about technology, take this class if you want to remember what makes education worthwhile and rewarding. Remember what it's like to learn with Professor Albert and you'll be grateful you did."
