      "Professor Siu\u2019s Math 213A was an interesting and beautiful course. As my second exposure to complex analysis, I have come away with it with a much better intuition and understanding of the intuition and ideas of the field, which is testament to Professor Siu\u2019s excellent lecturing and lecture notes \u2013 they are geared towards panoramic understanding of the field and how it connects to other fields of mathematics, emphasising that the beauty of analysis lies in the use and creation of its tools (kernels, series/ product expansions, the symmetries of certain special functions considered, and the ideas of growth order and factorisation) and drawing parallels between real and complex analysis whenever relevant to fortify understanding of both. The narrative of the course stuck very closely to the historical development of the field, which made the topics feel very naturally motivated and the flow of ideas much more coherent than I have seen in most other analysis courses. Problem sets were written well and made the material familiar, though a couple of them (with the glaring example being the final exam which took me upwards of 50 hours to finish) were too long in my opinion and could be shortened to around 75% of their current length and still serve their purpose, though the three signature problems of the course on the Bergman kernel, Koebe\u2019s construction of Riemann mappings, and the \u2018triangle tessalation\u2019 problem were all very interesting and memorable. With this change implemented though, this definitely has the potential to be one of the best courses I have ever taken.",
      "Very good class on complex analysis. This class is famously extremely hard (back in the day when Siu used to teach it a few years ago), but I got the sense that he really listened to past QGuide feedback and toned down the course by quite a lot. This meant that we covered a lot less than what he intended to teach (so no Gelfond\u2013Schneider, no univalent function theory, etc.) but we got to cover the topics we did in much greater depth (including many cool topics such as Nevanlinna theory, elliptic function theory). One gripe I have is that Siu would often repeat lectures (as in he'd start the next lecture saying the exact same thing he said the previous lecture), but I totally get it and it helps me revise a lot as well.The workload is very lightweight. Siu wants the homeworks to be trivial extensions of the lecture material where we get the chance to get our hands dirty working with the material, and it indeed was exactly what he intended. Each homework took me less than a day and helped me understand class material a lot more (homework problems were strictly either Stein Shakarchi Complex Analysis problems or his own problems extending ideas / proofs from his lecture materials). The final was a slightly longer homework, and this was also very doable. Overall, I really enjoyed this class, and it certainly finds its place as one of the classes that fundamentally shape my mathematics education.",

      "This is a good course. You will most definitely learn a lot, and I've learned things that I think I'll genuinely use for the remainder of my degree and research. Doing the textbook readings was helpful to comprehend the class material, but if you've got a very strong linear algebra background it might not be needed (more on the textbook later). The psets are good, I found quite a few of them enjoyable, and they're all reasonably scoped (taking 3\u20134 hours each). So if you add the psets with quiz review and readings for the lecture, you're looking at a fairly light workload for the course. Grading is all quick, and you get reasonable feedback for graded assignments. The lectures do a great job blending whiteboard instruction and matlab demonstrations of concepts, so you get the theory and practical application of most of what you learn. We haven't gotten project grades back at the time of writing, but I definitely spent a large portion of time (upwards of 30\u201340 hours) on the final project, but I'm not sure how that will translate grade wise. The quizzes, if you're reading Heath (if Heath is the textbook) and paying attention in class, you will still fail. I walked out of 2 of the 3 quizzes, content knowing that if I'd studied 10\u201315 more hours for the quiz and done every practice question in the back of the Heath chapters, I still would've done poorly. With a fairly robust postmortem of the first quiz to see how I could've studied more efficiently I'd come to the conclusion that the only way to stumble upon the information needed to answer the question was random chance googling or GenAI responses (because the material was absent in the textbook and lecture notes). Doing a thorough lit review for my final project, though, I found that Dr Trefethen had his own Numerical Computation textbook, and I was fairly shocked to find that all of the questions I thought were unreasonable on the quizzes were either explicit in his textbook or easily inferred from the information in his textbook. I'm not sure if this was deliberate, or just an extension of \"he thinks these are very important numerical computation concepts, noted by him putting them on the quiz and also in his textbook, but the two events aren't deliberately correlated\". The largest recommendation that I would have is to use his textbook to follow his lectures and prepare for his quizzes. I didn't find Heath particularly effective, and our lectures jumped around Heath so frequently that you'd skip large sections in certain chapters anyways. Our TFs were completely amazing \u2013 and I wanted to make sure to give them a shout out here. Elaine and Chuin Wei in particular put in a lot of work to help prepare students for quizzes and help students understand lectures. Chuin Wei's notes were better than mine most of the time, definitely helping prepare as best you could for the quizzes. Grading was incredibly fast (got most assignments back within a week), and generally fair. TFs rocked.",
      "Trefethen is very passionate about the subject matter, and it does show in his teaching. The lectures are good and problem sets are reasonable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the exams. There are 3 exams and, in general, they are extremely unreasonable. In a strange way, the exams aren't objectively that hard; they just require you to have exactly the right intuition about everything. Unfortunately, having the right intuition cannot be taught or learnt in one semester. And only Trefethen himself had that intuition, even amongst the teaching staff.  The result is that most people fail the exams, even after generous grading (and partial credit) by Trefethen. The exams feel less like a test of what you have learnt in the class and more a test of just naturally what your raw IQ is. There really is no way to prepare for the tests, either. You can read the textbook cover to cover and know and understand everything in the course perfectly well, but still fail the tests. Overall, I did learn quite a bit in this course. However, I also felt that most of the course content was quite dated, and should not be mandatory for students in the CSE program to learn.",
      "This is a class that is required for the Applied Math masters, but I think that everyone in the computational sciences should take it even if it isn't required! A gem of a class and there is more than enough support for students of various backgrounds to succeed. Course staff was awesome this year and Nick is an awesome lecturer and awesome computational scientist. You'll learn so much just from hearing him talk, but also make an effort to ask questions and converse with both him and course staff, especially around the project at the end of the semester."

      "Lecture material:The strength of this course is the amount of incredibly interesting material that we learn. Every day in class and outside of class is a day of learning. I am usually not a fan of flip classroom styled classes, but this course has changed my mind. We have recorded materials that we need to watch before lectures, and they form the foundation for our discussion in our class. I think the pace of the class is food because every week, we move onto a different topic. Sometimes, they may be related but not always. I think having time during the weekend to watch the recorded videos is a perfect opportunity for me to pace myself of the foundation I need. If I learned the foundation in lecture, I would be so lost because of the amount of material covered in an hour. I am a bit slow, so it takes me about 2\u20133 hours to get through the weekly videos. The discussions in class are really helpful because we dissect experimental results, which helps us when we complete the psets and just think like a scientist. This class would NOT work if we learned the material in class and conducted a discussion in class. There would simply not be enough time. We learn so much during discussions, and it is really important that the slides are more clearly noted with what we have learned. At the beginning of the class, the course staff was like \u2018oh, we cover a lot, sometime if you take notes than it will distract you and make you miss important details\u2019 and I was like ok, that means post discussion slides would be detailed with notes, and that only proves to be true for some and not all of the discussion materials. Course staff:We have three different lecturers, Dominic, Vlad, and Emma. Each three of the lecturers vary differently in their discussion style. It's like getting whiplash every 3\u20134 weeks. Out of the three, my favorite are Dominic and Emma. Dominic is good at fostering discussion ground. Emma is the most clear to the point. Vlad is very verbose, beats around the bush half the time, slides are not clearly labeled. I had a great and knowledgable TF that made section less painless. All of the CAs have taken the class before, and they have a superb understanding of the course material and the stress that goes along with this class.Section:The section is 4 hours long because it includes going over lecture material and lab. I really enjoyed the lab components. It is indeed about 3\u20134 hours a week, but I had a great randomly assigned lab group and a wonderful TF. Psets:The psets are not that much of a time commitment. If you go to the right CA office hours, you can get all of it done within the single hour and then have some spare time on your own to polish the answers you submit. They highly revolve around experimental data, which I think is great for fostering critical thinking.Exams:I wish the exams covered also conceptual questions and basic knowledge rather than just dissecting experimental results. Dissecting the amount of experimental results that we do in an hour and 15 minutes of exam time is sometimes unreasonable and not practical. In the real world, you would have lot more time to come up with the conclusions that we were to ask to come up with in the exam room. Background:I am not an MCB concentrator. I have never taken ls1a and ls1b before. I did relatively fine in the class. I would say in the pond full of premeds that this class is, the class was a bit more stressful due to the students than the professors. Students seem to always be a bit competitive, and it might just be me, but a bit judgmental. I get some off\u2013putting looks when I say something weird or incorrect in OH or in section, but I feel like that is what OH and section is for. Section TF and OH CAs are generally very good at slowing down the pace to help with understanding. It\u2019s just that people who have a good on hold on the content are much louder than the people who are confused. People in the class are generally pretty cracked, but as an individual, I still need to iron out the confusion I have. There are numerous times where I were made to feel inferior, but I think that is the nature of a biology class, and you can\u2019t take a biology class like this without having this many premeds in it. But don\u2019t let this be your deciding factor of whether you take this class or not. I really enjoyed the class regardless of how I felt about the students.",
      "Be very careful. Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. I feel very snubbed by this courses way of handling its grades. RUN! If you are not concentrating in MCB or CPB, please don't do this course it could destroy your GPA that you've spent your freshmen or sophomore year building. I worked really hard to make up for a bad grade I got on my first exam and I felt like even after getting above average for the next to exams, I don't know if I even made the cut off for an A at least. I also feel like it was stressful to take this course with other ones. Really plan your semester if you're planning on taking this class. And remember that the exams are all that really matter in the end ( even if they weight just 10% they're what differentiate your grade from others. )",

      "This class is very fast\u2013paced and can feel overwhelming at times, but I 100% recommend taking it. When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre\u2013med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly \u2013\u2013 if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night / Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget / overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments/psets/deliverables/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world\u2013renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts/insights/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts \u2013\u2013 they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text/shows you didn't read). It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading \u2013\u2013 helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts / getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same / could benefit from your points / questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise/edit/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. I hope this information/advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.",
      "Ok. Read the books pleaseee. I did not read them because I got so busy, and I really regret it, so much so that I intend to read them all over winter break. It can be a lot at first to get used to, but just do it. ALSO, read the odyssey over summer break if you are even considering taking this class. The first two weeks of school are so hectic that you will NOT have time then. Just do it.",

      "this class was pretty decent! the class is presentation\u2013based, as in, each class was made up of two presentations on papers assigned for homework. this could be kind of annoying because your grade is made up of giving a presentation \u2013\u2013 but also doing the perusall readings and commenting on each one (beyond like \"this is cool!\") \u2013\u2013 so class was oftentimes pretty redundant since you'd allegedly already done the readings in depth. sometimes the presentations were helpful for clearing up any confusions surrounding the papers, but overall, i found classtime more tedious than not. also, since there were two presentations, one for each reading, you would have half an hour to present on a twenty\u2013page research paper, plus questions and discussion time, and the second group usually had to speedrun through their presentation because this simply is not enough time. the material itself was pretty interesting, and since it covered such a wide range of hci topics, there were a lot of different areas to explore, which was really cool. this does mean that there were weeks that could be more boring if you just didn't care about the material, but weeks on privacy, creative support, climate, polling, etc. were all super awesome! the teaching staff was also really lovely. katy is really cool, and though elena went on maternity pretty early into the term, the times she was there were great as well. they were VERY nice about grades in particular \u2013\u2013 the first round of perusall grades came through and a lot of people were confused, so they let you go back and comment more on readings so that you could get a regrade. also, since a lot of the grades were dependent upon drafts of your final paper, if you missed a point or two from forgotten sections, not enough citations, etc., they would also let you go back and correct them. i'm not saying this for the sake of saying that you should take this class because they're nice about grades \u2013\u2013 what i'm saying is that they are KIND PEOPLE and that they care about you. i really, really liked all of them a lot. also, GO TO THE FINAL PRESENTATIONS! everyone's project was SO cool and it was really amazing to see what people had done with their time in this class. as an undergrad, tbh, this class is not my number one priority, but a lot of the grad students taking it do this research for their living, and seeing their incredible projects (and the incredible projects of fellow undergrads!) was really a cool opportunity. all in all \u2013\u2013 this class can be tedious sometimes, and the lecture component is sometimes not that great due to the presentation structure, but teaching staff are the best and a lot of cool stuff comes from studying hci. would recommend!",
      "Don't take this class\u2014very bad grading scale that is curved down for no reason. The final project is only graded out of 25 points, not 100, so even a few points off can knock you down to a 99, 98, or 97 (the course was graded out of 102 points) and earn you an A\u2013. How can the cutoff for an A in a grad class be 100?!If you're not perfect with Perusall comments, you can even get a B+ with 95. This is terrible and has completely ruined my experience of what I thought was the best course I've taken at Harvard. I am deeply dissatisfied with the grading in this course, and while I understand things change with Katy being the course instructor while Elena was on leave for most of the semester, there was NOTHING in the syllabus and NOTHING announced in class to suggest near perfection would be required to earn an A in the course. It invalidates all the hard work I put in and has harmed my mental health for the beginning of the break.Do not take this course if there is any mention of curving or if Elena is not the primary instructor. There was no curving in the past as far as I remember. The course is too coarse\u2013grained and a simple honest mistake can be punished by harming your letter grade by over a third. Very bad course for blindsiding students with this SUDDEN limitation of the number of A's to the top 30%.For full transparency, this is the Ed post announcing assignment of grades: ###Congrats on making it to the end of the semester. Final grades have been released, as well as feedback on your final report. Note the maximum number of points possible was 102. Here is how grades were assigned:A >=100 A\u2013 >= 96 B+ >= 90B >= 85 B\u2013 >= 80 Note that about 30% of students got an A, over 40% of students got an A\u2013, with the rest receiving B+/B/B\u2013. ###",

      "LISTEN TO ME! This course is NOT a gem, or easy, or anything like that. On the contrary, this course requires a stupendous amount of work, both in the classroom and out. This is a very conceptually difficult class because of how new/different the material is (most people have never studied something like this before) as well as the volume of material that is taught on (CelNav is a very complex discipline with many moving parts). In the beginning of the semester I thought that the Tuesday night labs (19\u20132200) were going to be relatively easy but as the semester progressed, they became a significant drain on both my time to complete other assignments as well as my sleep schedule. The star/sun journal that they make you keep is also extremely time consuming. The P\u2013Sets can be nightmarish, depending on how well you know the material. Why you should take this course is because you will never get another chance to do celestial navigation again in your life. My advice would be take this class pass\u2013fail, make every use of office hours (which they are very generous with), and use this class to satisfy your QRD requirement. The professor and the teaching staff are extremely personable and likable people who love students.Take the class, but don't let anyone say that it wasn\u2019t work. The only difference is that this is work worth doing. Also, Max, you are always in our hearts. Gone, never forgotten",
      "It is definitely fun to take the class but it is a TON of work!!! There were lots of times doing problem sets led my partner and I to almost break down crying. Make sure you find out when office hours are in advance and are okay with blocking them off in your schedule because they are essentially necessary to be able to pass",

      "Okay, first the pessimistic side of things: Physics 143b is hard. Not for everyone in this class, many people seem to be chilling, but from someone who is generally maybe not the brightest physicist let me tell you that for us normal kids it is really hard. HOWEVER, it is doable. I never went to office hours before taking this class, which I definitely had to change. And you certainly need to put some hours in, but no one fails and people care for you, especially Prof Mitrano. And now to the optimistic side of things: Prof Mitrano is A\u2013MA\u2013ZING!!! He cares so incredibly much about this class, he encourages participation so well and above all his humor is so sharp and great that it is a pleasure going to class. He creates a great sense of community (the fact that it's hard also plays into that community\u2013building aspect) and I got my graded exams back three hours (!) after I put down my pen. He also really cares about how things are going with this class, so if something is going harder than you think it should go you can and should definitely tell him right away. And for the academic side of things: I only understood how little I had understood from 143a and quantum physics after taking 143b. There is a reason why the courses have the same number, not necessarily because the topics overlap a lot but because you won't get any understanding of quantum with just taking 143a. I would say I only understood like 70 % of this class but at least now I understand everything from 143a and trust me I did not understand anything coming out of that course. So take this class. If you want to go to grad school or not, it is worth it. I will probably not go any higher level for now but it was definitely a really rewarding experience and trust me: If I could do it, you can do it for sure! :)",

      "Prof. Harris is amazing, and the CAs are all great and super willing to help out in class. It's a great class regardless of whether you plan to study more theoretical math or not.In terms of content, I would say it is pretty manageable especially if you have some background in abstract algebra (i.e. linear algebra or further) and/or proof\u2013writing, though definitely not a necessary pre\u2013req. Homework is weekly, a bit on the longer side (occasionally some rather tedious exercises) but quite straightforward (takes around 10 hours at most, and Harris is super lenient about extensions). The main textbook (D&F) and class content align pretty closely, so it is helpful to look at. The final follows very closely from homework so if you do well on psets/understand how to do the problems then you should be set! My only minor concern throughout is that we get feedback on homework quite late, though homework solutions are posted for reference which is nice. Overall a really good class :)",
      "Fake class unfortunately. Joe is a very illuminating lecturer, but he is hindered by a.) answering every question, even the extremely stupid ones, with 10\u201315 minute\u2013long tangents, and b.) not knowing what is on the psets and therefore covering topics completely out of sequence, sometimes covering material necessary for homeworks after they are due. These two things combined made me feel that, even though I would often leave with some kernels of useful intuition, attending lecture was on the whole a waste of time, and so I stopped attending after the first 2 or 3 weeks.Another issue I had was that the homeworks, while mostly fine, sometimes contained extremely tedious, useless problems for seemingly no reason (e.g. verify that these theorems hold for this group by checking all 20+ cases), which really gave me the impression that Joe had both not written the homeworks and also had no idea what was on them. By the start of finals, we had gotten back 2 of the 11 homeworks, so there was also no real way to gauge one's performance or level of learning in the class; I also suspect, writing this the day before grades come out, that our final exams were never graded or looked at. I understand that this is kind of just how math classes are at Harvard, but it really did not fill me with confidence about this course.Take if you love self\u2013studying and reading terrible textbooks. Or if you need to take this class as a Math concentrator. Otherwise, don't take.",

Assignments gave a lot of freedom to explore the philosophy however you wanted, which I think is a strength of this class. A creative final project is also a super interesting way to engage with the material. Weekly section reflections often feel like busy work, but they're not too bad. Having certain components graded on completion also takes some of the pressure off. Fair warning, however, the A grade is set at >95%, so prepare to lock in a little. Feedback was okay. Section conversations were often lively and interesting debates. With two essays, a final project, weekly readings and section reflections, this class is a decent amount of work for a gened but nothing crazy. I genuinely do think the texts give you a unique perspective and are worth reading, engaging with, and applying to the real world.

TLDR: LS2 almost ruined me but i would definitely recommend!",

Two weeks maybe, but it\u2019s mostly constantly, all the time. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I loved learning everything in this course but the tears and the stress is crazy. I also took it with very hard classes which I\u2019m begging you not to do. The lab practicals are ok, the exams are long. 17 pages in one hour one time. There\u2019s no multiple questions and the questions are VERY PARTICULAR. Your whole term will be dependent on this class. There\u2019s no psets but do not be fooled by that. The content is taught in a chaotic order and often time it\u2019s very frustrating. The amount of information you need to learn and reproduce down to every detail is insane. All I can say is be aware and good luck.",

All the professors are very evidently passionate about their field of research and teaching LS2, which makes the class a really enjoyable experience. HOWEVER I will caveat by saying that this was also undeniably the hardest class I have taken. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. The sheer amount of memorization and level of detail you need to know for the exams (which are all recall\u2013based) and the 2 midterm/3 lab practical structure means that it feels like you are studying for an exam in this class every other week. If that doesn't deter you though, it is such a great class. Also try and get Joel's lab sections if you can!! He is a GEM of a lab TF and also truly cares about his students."

Demarco's lecture notes are wonderful, and the other texts in the course basically just provide further detail. The p\u2013sets are pretty difficult, especially at the beginning, but they seem to get easier throughout the semester as you get the hang of things. I would say the level of the problems was pretty perfect, because it felt challenging and interesting but it really was something that we would be able to do. The CA's are really great and offer tons of OH for when you are stuck. The structure of the classes is that the first half or so is lecture, then you spend the next half working in groups on worksheet problems (usually short proofs). It is super valuable practice and a great time to get feedback from CA's. There was even more practice available in the weekly sections. Exams were not as challenging as homeworks and did not feel too rushed for a class period. All of this feedback comes with the caveat that things may be different under a different instructor, and Demarco won't be teaching next year. However, I think this class is generally well\u2013run and a good introduction to the field if you have an interest. Also, if you ever get a chance to take a class with Demarco, take it!!",

      "Fun class. Analytic number theory is quite a gem as a subject of mathematics. The results are fundamental and beautiful; the proof methods are quite unexpected but end up being very very nice. I happen to be a fan of number theory, but in any case, it is an area worth exploring. There are roughly weekly problem sets (though they started week 3); mostly exercises in the course notes. They are relatively chill; nothing nonstandard. Sometimes computational and takes some effort, but overall it is a lighter course compared to some other grad courses I have taken. The final project is a fun way to explore something cool (I wrote about Bertrand's Postulate; there are a good number of options though, such as the PNT error term, which are more technical). The course notes are fairly extensive and relatively well\u2013written; the class provides a decent amount of rigor. However there are frequent typos, some of which are nontrivial and can lead to confusion. I wish more motivation for the main results was provided in lectures (for instance, the proof of the PNT followed is probably the fastest one; however it does not provide a clear relation between, say, the zeta function, zero\u2013free regions, and strength of PNT bounds; thus it is not wholly clear from lecture why one should expect a relation between PNT\u2013type results and analysis of the zeta function near the strip Re z \\in [0,1], which is key to analytic NT). Some more intuitive explanations would have helped here. Overall an enjoyable course!",

Four major themes will be examined. First, the importance of the region in the origin and early development of Western imperialism and capitalism: Why did both Western Europe and America begin their imperial and colonial expansion in this region and to what degree did the region\u2019s slave-based economies influence the nature and development of Western capitalism? Second, what were the consequences of imperialism for the demographic and socio-cultural fate of indigenous and African populations? Is genocide a proper designation of the fate of exploited peoples of the region up to the end of the period of slavery? Third, we examine the post-colonial consequences of this history for the socio-political, economic and cultural development of the region. What have been the main paths toward sustainable development in the modern Caribbean? Why in spite of its long history of engagement with Western capitalism, has the region largely faltered in its efforts to develop? We examine the different paths to development through five case studies\u2014neo-colonial dependency in Puerto Rico, communist dependency in Cuba, democratic socialism in Jamaica, Barbados\u2019 neo-liberal strategy, and aid-dependency in Haiti. We also study the common problem of migration and transnationalism and the degree to which this process undermines national sovereignty. Fourth, we explore the distinctive features of racial classification and cultural representations in the Caribbean. What do we learn about race as a social construction from the Caribbean experience? How do Caribbean racism and colorism unsettle American notions of race and ethnic identities? Why has globalization not led to cultural homogenization? How do we account for the unusual influence of Caribbean music, especially that of Jamaica, on popular global culture?",

We will explore how different modes of breathing and resonance impact effective communication. We will also explore voice and identity through discussion of regionalisms, gender and voice, and code shifting.

      "TL;DR: Chem 30 is the hardest class I've ever taken, but is super rewarding. Professor Myers is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff, but be prepared to spend A LOT of time on this class memorizing the material. Here's how the course worked for me: in class, Professor Myers presented a flurry of mechanisms and reactions, and I quickly copied those down (be prepared to write fast). I didn't really understand them the first time around (this is okay) because it's a challenge to keep up with Myers' pace, but it's nothing to worry about Next, I would attempt the Lecture Integration problems (a short worksheet based on the new content from the last lecture that is due every lecture)  to test my knowledge. Then, I would look over the pset and see how much I remembered, and do the first few problems. Then, I would look back at the lecture boards / lecture recordings as a guide, and attempt all the other problems, and go to office hours and check everything one more time before submitting my pset. For tests, there are ample practice materials, but be sure to do ALL of them: I know I definitely needed the practice. If you do all the practice materials, the exams will feel fair and simple.Chem 30 is a HARD class, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Everyone is pretty much in the same boat: you will need to memorize a LOT of reactions, but it all feels fun and new. Your synthetic capabilities will grow exponentially compared to just having taken Chem 20. Finally, the community in the course is excellent. The teaching staff is absolutely stellar: they are super qualified and really know their stuff. The other students are also struggling through the same content you are, so it's not hard to make new friends. All in all, Chem 30 demands a large time commitment, but is an awesome class with great people.",
      "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I really enjoyed Chem 20, but this class is a mess and the high reviews on the Q guide are very misleading because it is filled with Chemistry majors that will rank chemistry classes high regardless of whether it is a good class. If you are not a chemistry major, I would highly advise taking Chem 27 instead. I think the optimal series is Chem 20 and then Chem 27.There are many problems with Chem 20:1) it is simply a memorization game\u2013\u2013there are hundreds of reactions given to you and you simply have to memorize the reagents involved, the mechanisms involved, and when to use them. Any one of them could show up at any time, on any assignment. Unlike Chem 20 where I felt like I was learning a new way of thinking about chemistry, this course was just drilling reaction after reaction into my brain, which wasn't fun or rewarding. If you took Chem 20, you have already learned how to do synthesis; you don't need this class to advance that skill.2) The structure of this course is really bad all around. First, don't let the 2x a week lectures fool you. These lectures consist of Professor Myers writing reaction after reaction after reaction after reaction on the board. Then it is entirely on you to actually learn the material. You will retain essentially nothing in lecture and Professor Myers does nothing to engage students during the lectures. Second, EVERYTHING IS ON PAPER, which may sound fine, but it gets really frustrating because you have to print everything (the daily lecture problems and the problem sets) if you do work on the iPad. This was a bit crazy for 2024. Third, there was often complex material on the problem sets that was taught the day before the long PSETS were due, which meant trying to watch youtube videos that covered the material or begging CAs for the answers because there just wasn't enough time to wait to actually learn the material in class.3) Some of the exam questions were unfair and covered material that wasn't taught. After we got the test back, I tried to find where some of the material was in the course materials and frequently it just wasn't there. The material is hard enough that asking about material that wasn't taught or introduced is a bit unfair.____________Finally, if you are premed, this class is not a way around the 17/27 series. You will learn more and find the material more interesting in the Chem 17/27 classes. This class is very hard and filled with people who have been doing chemistry their entire life (olympiad kids and international chemistry kids), so even if the curve is slightly more generous, you are taking this class with an entirely different population of people than Chem 17 and 27.

      "I do not think this course prepared me to participate in theoretical / methodological debates in the field. I came away from the course without a basic understanding of many or even most of the works on the syllabus. I have a few main points of feedback:\u2013 Kojo\u2019s teaching style in this course was not accessible. He very frequently refers to theorists / theories or secondary sources that were not on the syllabus without explaining who they are or what they said (eg performativity theory, Butler, Habermas, Schussler Fiorenza, Asad, and so on). I rarely had the background knowledge necessary to understand those references, and the frequency of these references made the class very challenging for me to follow.\u2013 Relatedly, there was very little explanation of the main arguments / philosophical systems of the texts we read, even when they were dense philosophical works. Instead, the discussion started at the level of the texts\u2019 implications for the study of religion and / or debates in the secondary literature about how to interpret them. This led to bad discussions because few people were prepared to engage with the text at that level (only those with prior knowledge) \u2014 so students\u2019 comments were often based on fundamental misunderstandings and I (as well as I think most others) typically remained confused about the texts' core presuppositions and arguments at the end of the class.Those were the big issues in my opinion and the reason why I think this class unfortunately did not work. There were some other issues too:\u2013 unclear expectations. for example, never mentioning half the assignments on the syllabus again after the first week, until telling us toward the end of the semester that those assignments weren\u2019t happening; or sending instructions for our final paper proposal on Friday when the proposal was due Monday\u2013 some weeks the syllabus included too many dense texts for us to give enough time to any of them in class\u2013  I think there was not enough room in class for conversations to form between students without being cut off / redirected.I don\u2019t want to seem overly harsh or negative, because I do really appreciate all the work that Kojo put into teaching us this semester. But I am giving my honest impression of where the class fell short in the hope that it can be improved for future cohorts.",

      "If you need to learn multi and you're in Econ, absolutely take this class over 21a. Roderic is the best, and he makes himself available for office hours, even outside of the ones he has posted. The PSets start out pretty easy (less than 1.5 hours per PSet), but some of the later ones took me a few hours, so make sure to at least budget a good amount of time and work with a good group/go to OH. Our CAs were also great and provided a lot of times for us to work on PSets.My only criticism is that the class gets a little confusing after the first and second midterms, and I wish Roderic spent more time explicitly teaching some of the more difficult techniques in class. Otherwise, if you don't understand the new ideas when you work on problems with your table at the chalkboards, you won't understand anything for the rest of class. This isn't terrible, since I think Roderic is really amazing at explaining things one\u2013one in office hours, but something to watch out for. Overall, though, definitely a super painless math class. I came in as a sophomore, having taken BC Calc in HS and nothing Freshman year. I reviewed basic integration techniques and calc concepts over the summer (just on Khan Academy), which was very helpful but not strictly necessary. If you're worried, like I was, that we'd use more advanced calc class, don't be. You don't need trig\u2013sub, series, etc. I think we might've used integration by parts once or twice? But most of the time when we integrated it was just reverse power rule, very simple. The hard part of this class is understanding the concepts, not actually doing the math (since you don't even need a calculator for the class).",

      "You should probably know band theory, but no one said it would be all that interesting. Subir talks about some topological stuff too, though, which is much better. The problem sets were mainly from Aschroft and Mermin, which means the problem solving difficulty (and required understanding of the material) was very low, but still the calculations would often be annoying to do. Lecture was reasonably interesting, though a bit slow. For us, the problem set grading was the harshest I've ever had, though this certainly depends on the TF, and the take\u2013home final was really easy.

Students will develop skills within three areas: managing self-awareness for leadership, developing strategic approaches to complex situations, and interpreting meaning. At the heart of each class session will be interactive learning experiences that include case studies, role-play, debating, and team-based interviewing of a wide range of administrators and leaders. Because many HDS MDiv and MTS graduates are contributors to communities that encounter complex problems, students will be taught how to shepherd meaning through shared communal processing. This course teaches students how to develop contextual and communal approaches to leadership and administration as opposed to dictatorial forms of leadership. Students will learn that ethical leadership and moral administration begins with humility, keen listening, compassionate engagement (to self and others as well as to new information), and the interrogation and evaluation of their own moral compasses, values, strengths, and immunities to certain forms of change. This course will pay close attention to the complex layers of communal conflict and/or challenges by distinguishing between technical and adaptive challenges. Students will be taught to attend to what matters most in each situation and how to motivate substantive and sustainable responses to adaptive problems. Additionally, the course also shows leaders how to do more than \u201csolve problems\u201d. It teaches students how to forge a more productive understanding of the human interactions, motivations, and fears that play crucial roles in the development of a community\u2019s capacity for change and courageous action.This is a limited enrollment course.

However, the class was a good review of intermediate economic concepts and did teach me quite a bit about how the EU functions and makes decisions. The midterm paper was really fun to write.Without weekly problem sets or response papers, it was hard to apply what I learned on a week\u2013to\u2013week basis. Section felt like a rehash of lecture and was not engaging. I started my final paper relatively early, but I wrote about a topic that was only tangentially related to lecture materials, so it felt difficult to integrate.Overall, decent elective with some gem\u2013like qualities, but there are better Econ courses out there."

      "Ls1a is exactly what the title says \u2013\u2013\u2013 an integrated introduction to the life sciences. I think that Ls1a had an excellent curriculum, and masterfully blended chemistry and biology topics, which made each topic more digestible and understandable. I strongly encourage taking Ls1a for anyone who is looking to get a really strong foundation in these fields. I believe that taking AP Bio and AP Chem prior to taking Ls1a strongly helps make the class more understandable, but you need no real background, so it is possible to take without having taken those courses or an IB equivalent previously. However, LPSA may be more digestible if you didn't take AP Bio and AP Chem in high school. What I like best about this class is that it provides something for everyone, in terms of learning styles. The content is essentially taught three times: learning pods, lectures, and section. The best part is that learning pods provide both videos and textbook readings, which my friends and I are pretty evenly split between. Doing both is great, but usually just one will suffice. Personally, I only use chapters because I struggle to focus in lecture, and I learn pretty well from just reading and taking notes on these chapters. Section is really great for its small environment (~12 students each), which is additionally great for people who can't focus on lecture, and either way, it goes into much greater depth than lecture does which is super helpful for clarifying topics.Generally, I really think this is a great class to take. It is honestly not that difficult if you just put the time and effort in. The midterms and final are extremely fair, and the labs and problem sets aren't too time\u2013consuming or overwhelmingly difficult, but rather help to solidify concepts. I do suggest finding a study group to check your work with, however, as it is easy to make small mistakes on homeworks, and checking has always helped me solidify the concepts in my own brain. Overall, as long as you put the time in, the class is very digestible.TLDR; take this class if you have already taken AP Chem and AP Bio, or if you just want a fuller foundation in these topics. There is something to fit everyone's learning style, and if you simply put in the time to learn in the way that works best for you, the class is very reasonable and super informative thanks to its excellently crafted and integrated curriculum. (Also, great for pre\u2013meds and non\u2013pre\u2013meds. I'm not pre\u2013med and I found this class super useful!)",
      "I highly recommend this course, but it will not necessarily be easy. I often found myself feeling absolutely confused; however, rather than give up, I reanalyzed my study habits/went to office hours/asked questions in section and would come to understand the material. Before taking this class, my biology background was so weak, but this class helped to fill those gaps.",

Other courses usually just have one huge topic and as soon as you stop following in a week you are cooked for the rest of the class. Since you basically do a new topic every week it does not hurt too much if you do not understand something (as long as you catch up with it for exams later on) so it is a great course to balance some other classes. It really fuelled my enthusiasm for physics again that I thought I lost at college and it is great fun. Above all, however, Prof Morin is simply amazing as everyone can tell who ever took a class with him. He is so incredibly structured and really cares about your experience in the class (he also did further readings if we asked silly questions that he could not answer in lecture and sent us follow up emails with further nerdy knowledge). And if you get Anmol as your TF then this class gets even more amazing because he is phenomenal! Take it, take it, take it!!!",

      "TLDR: Take this class \u2013 my favorite class of all time! At the end of this course you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian very well at a basic level! I now feel confident to strike up a conversation and can hold my own. If you're unsure just pull up to the first class, you'll love it so much you'll stay!(Much) Longer version:Professor:\u2013 Dima (Dmitrii), the professor, is the best professor of all time. Seriously he cares so much, he's incredible enthusiastic, and makes the course an incredible amount of fun. He is the greatest professor I've ever had and should be a tenured professor with several awards named after him. With him, you don't just learn the language. As you learn more Russian in terms of grammar, vocab, and speaking you will also learn poems, songs, watch a movie, record a video, and read a story! You don't just learn the language but appreciate and learn about the culture. \u2013 Dima and Roy (the TF) put in so much work and make it so fun and easy for you to learn. Definitely some of the best and hard working faculty on this campus.If you're thinking of taking this course:1) Go to the first day \u2013 if you love it like I did, you'll likely stay but please go \u2013 it's incredible2) Yes it is actually 2 courses worth of work \u2013 see the structure (if you really want to think of it as 1 course think about it this course has around the same or higher median amount of work outside of class as notorious classes like \u2013 Stat110, EC1011a, Chem 27, CS 124 \u2013 but instead of 3h of class a week you have 8h).  I.e. think of it as 2 classes and you'll be fine since then it's closer to 2 medium classes work or 1.5 hard classes. If you're between doing Russ AAB (8 credit) vs AA (4 credit) here's what to know:1) you will spend 8h of class instead of 5h and do 1.5\u20132x the work but move through double the material. You learn much more, become more fluent and it's epic.2) At the end of the semester you will know all the Russian cases and be able to understand and speak basic Russian really well (fluency is gained not only by how much time you spend learning but also but in what timeframe, i.e. doing 2x the work in the same time results in learning more than 2x quicker)3) The students who take this really want to be here. They came to learn the language and so people are more focused, interesting and you learn from each otherIf you want to talk to people who have taken the course/are unsure:\u2013 Talk to Dr Clancy and/or Dima AND ask them to connect you with students who have taken the course \u2013 they are happy to and we are happy to give you our unfiltered takes (which is we loved it but we'll also be real about the amount of work and if this course is right for you).Structure (and to give an idea of what the time breakdown looks like):\u2013 To start with the reason you have so much work is because if you do the work you will learn \u2013 it's intentionally structured this way. This isn't like other classes where you need to put in time outside of the homework to actually learn. \u2013 8h of class a week of which 3h is small speaking section (usually like 1:30 or like 10:30 or some combo but happens MWF) and 5x normal class every morning. The small speaking sections will fit around your schedule don't worry. Not sure who the TF will be but they will teach Tuesday and Thursday mornings and grade assignments while Dima will teach the small speaking sections as well as the MWF mornings.\u2013 Approx 2h a day of HW for Mon\u2013Thurs \u2013 Friday you have a vocab test (you should spend like 20m a day studying)\u2013 Weekly (take home) unit tests which take more or less 1h\u2013 Check your HW and Unit tests after they've been graded to learn from errors\u2013 Midterm and Final (Oral and written) \u2013 Dima has practice exams which are super useful!!(If we're being honest, even though you should, you're probably not doing it EVERY day, but try space it out, maybe do it in 2 or 3 sessions in a week \u2013 DO NOT leave it for one day a week, you will feel behind all week, spend the entire Sunday working, and it's not fun)Grades:\u2013 Like most language at Harvard, don't worry \u2013 if you learn the language (which you will), you will do well. (no I will not be elaborating but when I say don't worry about the grade I truly mean it because if you instead just learn the language you will do great and have fun).\u2013 I mean you're not really taking this course because you are worried about a grade but rather you want to learn the language... BUT this course doesn't have tricks it's straightforward with course staff who want you to success and at no point is there surprises or are you trying to be caught out. Other vibes:\u2013 The Russian Students Society host fun and epic events and get to meet and practice Russian.\u2013 The Slavic Languages program have fun events like the weekly Lowell Language Table, crepe making etc. The faculty are uber accessible and it's always a good time.\u2013 The Davis Center for Eurasian studies has awesome events you should attend to learn more about politics, people, region.",

      "Now, to get it out of the way, yes, this class is stupidly difficult. The analogy of drinking water from a firehose is not at all inaccurate and I would not recommend taking it alongside more than one other really difficult course (like physics 16,CS61 from what I've heard for example) \u2013 it is possible, but it will likely crush you. One other really difficult course is doable if you're very comfortable with, I have friends that have done it, but they were in a position where those courses were very commensurate with their skill level. Nonetheless, despite the extreme difficulty, I would still recommend this course as strongly as I am capable if you love math. You do NOT have to be a genius with boatloads of competition mathematics experience in order to take this class. The highest level of mathematics I ever did formally in high school was single variable calculus and the basics of complex numbers and some very very elementary proofs, and I was still able to score above average in the course without sacrificing my entire life on its altar. I would however say that it is quite difficult to do well in the class without at least one of the following:\u2013 Some experience in high school with more advanced mathematics, especially linear algebra. This is not so much because it will directly come up as something tested in the course, as although we do spend a lot of time on linear algebra it takes a form almost unrecognizable to many of my friends who did linear algebra in high school, but rather because it gives useful intuition as to how to think concretely about very abstract concepts, and a concrete example to reach for when you want to play around with a new idea. \u2013 Exposure to and interest in abstract mathematics. This was what I had that I felt helped me the most. This doesn't need to be formal \u2013 most of my background came from a nigh\u2013unhealthy amount of mathematics youtube videos watched as well as having worked through the beginnings of several lecture notes covering the beginnings of a couple of the university\u2013level subjects I was interested in. These do not need to be directly related to the course material at all, but rather help get you in the mindset of abstract mathematics \u2013 figuring out how to set up a proof, how to see the kinds of patterns and tricks that come up in abstract math, and also just to enjoy the little references to other fields of mathematics that often come up. The course basically assumes being comfortable with this mode of thinking and although you can pick it up along the way, trial by fire and all that, it does help to have it already.With that out of the way, a final couple notes on the difficulty of the course: firstly, although it is indeed incredibly difficult, that difficulty is fairly frontloaded in that it doesn't get too much worse than the first couple problem sets (not that it gets much easier either, but it does mean that if you survive the first couple weeks without completely burning yourself up you can likely survive the rest) and secondly, again despite that difficulty the grading is relatively lenient, and as long as you solve the problems you will likely score quite well. This is especially true of the fact that extensive collaboration is tolerated and actively encouraged by the course \u2013 it becomes much much more manageable once you find a good problem set group to work through it with and the scope of what kind of collaboration is permitted is quite broad. A tip on study groups \u2013 try and find a group with a roughly comparable skill level to yours in the class, as being in a problem set group with someone much more or less mathematically able than you is generally not very productive for either party. This also helps with another issue that I found to be quite common: impostor syndrome. Since many people taking this course would have been the resident math whiz at their high school but are just another student in this class it can often be easy to feel as if you don't really deserve to be in the class, and having a group of people around you who are going through the same sort of thing and have a similar skill level to you can really help with that. That said, it also helps to have a group of people whose skills complement each other \u2013 the joke in my pset group was always that we had the logician (me), the physicist, and the generalist mathematician, and our respective orientations helped a lot with building solutions together; I could often spot slight technicalities that the other two missed, the physicist had very strong concrete intuitions for things and could see angles we couldn't, and the generalist mathematician often had a lot of insights that I was too deep in the weeds to see and that weren't the physicist's style. Now as to the professor. I do not exaggerate when I say Denis Auroux is the BEST professor I have ever had in any academic context. He is a brilliant, lucid lecturer who takes incredibly deep, intricate concepts that I personally would have had to spend many times the number of hours we had to understand otherwise and makes them crystal clear and motivated. He always makes sure to really work through the details of why a result is true while keeping it approachable and comprehensible, which is a terribly difficult balance to strike. He was also eminently available to all of his students \u2013 he generally responds to slack questions within minutes (he's so quick that it's become something of a joke amongst classmates) and his office hours are pure gold. He makes a conscious effort in them to make sure every single question is heard and answered throughly and he gives incredibly well thought out hints. One can also very clearly tell how much he cares about his students \u2013 he takes the time to get to know each of their idiosyncrasies and work with them. He's also just very approachable and willing to laugh with you. The CAs are also as a whole excellent, giving incredibly useful advice on the problems and having office hours on all but one day of the week.As for the content, it is incredibly deep and interesting (although in order to cover so much it is done at incredibly breakneck pace). The main areas covered are group theory (up to and including the Sylow approach to classification of finite groups), abstract linear algebra (with a stringent focus on doing things rigorously and thoroughly, which makes it look very different to the kind of linear algebra many will have done in high school since we don't do much at all with matrix computations, for example even defining the determinant is the last thing we do in the linear algebra section of the course), and their intersection in the form of representation theory. This is covered in the lectures, but a lot of the growth in the course happens in the problem sets. These are generally 8\u201312 questions in length and will unless you are really brilliant take you most of the week to solve \u2013 finishing a math 55 pset is always a bright moment in the week. The problems are very rarely computational and often force you to be very creative in coming up with a solution. The advantage fo this very heavy problem set workload though is tat generally speaking because they force you to become so intimately familiar with the material in order to solve them you generally have to do very little studying outside of just doing the problem sets.Finally, I just want to issue a final recommendation to please, if you do love math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It will be hard, it will eat up a lot of your time, but you will come out a better mathematician than I daresay any other class at any other university could have made you. I can deal with mathematical problems and concepts now that I could never have even begun to wrap my head around before taking this course, and I am much more confident in my ability to actually contribute to complex math. Furthermore, the content itself is just too beautiful to pass up \u2013 you will prove results just in the problem sets that are themselves substantial and will make you wonder at the beauty of math. There are very few other experiences that have made me marvel at the sheer beauty of the thing quite as much as math 55. It has been hands down my favourite course of my first semester and quite possibly my favourite academic experience full stop. If you love math and are willing to really put a lot of time into it and want to beecome a better mathematician, this course will be life\u2013changing. There is nothing else quite like math 55.",
      "Start psets early, and for office hours, don't be afraid to talk to Auroux. Auroux is way more knowledgeable than CAs and he answers questions in a timely manner. Often, just talking to him about a problem for 5 minutes creates a breakthrough for a problem that you have been dealing with for hours.",

If you put a lot of time into it, you will do great \u2014 but you do need to set aside a significant amount of your week for the course. This includes going to section, 2.5 hours for the MCQ, 3+ hours for the LP, and then a couple hours of just general content review (which is crucial for the course, in my opinion). The MCQs (especially) and LPs are quite difficult, but they map really well onto the midterm and final. For studying for the exams, the bulk of what I did was just reviewing the MCQs and LPs, as they are very useful. In some ways, I almost found Ec1010a easier than Ec10a at times because the LPs and MCQs were so difficult, and the exams were easier in comparison. Also, definitely go to lecture and do the CRQs, as these also appear on MCQs and exams and are super helpful for deepening your knowledge. And find a study group for the MCQs early!! Overall, this course is hard but super rewarding, and you will walk a way with a very comprehensive understanding of microeconomics.",

      "THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE CS COURSE AT HARVARD BY FAR. Everyone I knew said this course was terrible and so miserable and difficult so I put it off until my senior fall to take it, but wow I don't know why it's gotten such bad reviews. Eddie is a PHENOMENAL lecturer. He is a genius coder and such a good teacher. He explains things so clearly and is always so helpful and willing to answer questions or rephrase. I love all of his pictures\u2013\u2013he draws out the concepts for us which makes them so clear. If you go to lectures or watch them later, you have everything you need to complete the psets. The course notes online are so helpful and clearly laid out. The problem sets are so clearly laid out and so FUN. You have one pset every two weeks and they are so. much. fun! The first pset is about memory allocation and ik it sounds boring but it was so much fun!! The second pset we had to diffuse a BOMB?!?! How cool is that!! You feel like a cool hacker in a movie when you're doing it. All of the psets I had such a blast doing. YES it is going to take hours and hours and hours\u2013\u2013BUT it is such a fun process. It is not too difficult\u2013\u2013most of it you will be able to do on your own from the lectures and course website and when you get stuck the TFs are incredible and wednesday office hours with pizza are always such a blast. After taking so much theory courses (120 and 124), this course reminded me of the joy of coding again. It was genuinely such a fun time, you just get to solve fun little problem sets with your code and the staff and resources provide it make it challenging but so doable and so so enjoyable. I genuinely do not know why it gets so many bad reviews. I had such a blast. Have so so much fun taking it :) If you go to lectures and see the problem sets as fun puzzle games (don't start them too late or you will just be stressed and won't be able to enjoy them!), then I promise you will have such a great time.",
      "I really enjoyed this class, but I made the mistake of taking two hard classes at the same time. This course will teach you plenty about the underlying function of computers, but you get out of it what you put in. I learned the most by doing the problem sets and reading the course website.",

To meet these goals, we will read a substantial portion of the Quran in translation and draw extensively on modern academic scholarship on the Quran.

Prof. Goudarzi facilitates a very open\u2013minded, non\u2013sectarian and safe environment to explore the Quran without judgement.  Goudarzi's own research is also groundbreaking in its own right and it was always a treat whenever he would present on this in the class.  Super smart and humble guy! The class didn't have much emphasis on the ethics or linguistical aspects of Quranic analysis which would have been interesting but that is understandable given how jam packed the course already was. Alongside parts of the Quran as a primary readings, the other readings were fascinating, providing insights into frameworks of analysis, culture around different points in the Qurans history, key polemics, and more. Section wasn't very structured for this class this year but the class did not suffer because of that \u2013 I do think this element will be improved upon in future years for sure.

      "This is honestly a pretty good course and an excellent way to complete your language requirement. The fact that you receive 8 credits for one course and satisfy the language requirement in one semester makes it a \"really good deal.\" That offering for this course is completely merited though. You really do learn the full contents of French 10 and French 11 and leave the course as a shockingly decent French speaker. The course is well\u2013structured, though there are times where it feels like you may learn a bit ahead of the pace of course as it takes time to get to tenses/grammatical phrases. The idea of having everyone create a character in a Parisian appartment building is unique and makes the course a bit more fun. All the work that's completed for the class genuinely does improve your French ability.You'll leave this course ideally at the B1 CEFR level which is pretty good. I actually feel like I can somewhat speak French now and that's pretty remarkable for just a semester of work. Showing up to a class 5 days a week isn't for everyone (and when they say 5 days a week, they really mean 5 days a week since the syllabus allows for very few missed classes). Fortunately, our class met at 12pm which isn't too early, though attendance may be more challenging if this course is offered at an earlier time in the future. I have few criticisms of this course. It did always feel weird that it was run by Dr. Mills technically even though it didn't seem people in the course interacted with her. Anselme, the actual teacher, was excellent and cared about our learning French and fully addressing all our questions. Another thing is that you'd expect a class with ~15 people meeting every weekday to cause people to forge some strong friendships, but, to me, it seemed like everyone in the class liked each other, but that nobody was particularly close. That's not even a strong criticism, just a counterintuitive observation.If you're interested in French, want to get your language requirement done, or like learning quickly: take this course! It's pretty well\u2013run, you'll learn a lot of French, and the 8 credits is pretty nice. The grading always feels fair, and as long as you attend and submit things on time, you'll probably do very well. The one strong piece of advice I have is to do all of the homework exercises each week. They don't take very long, and while you could just look at the answer key, I don't think most people do because it's a very good learning tool. I always took my time on the exercises and then corrected them after because it always filled gaps in my knowledge in a pretty efficient amount of time and also prepared me well for the quizzes. I'm glad I took this course, and look forward to being able to speak more French. I originally dreaded dealing with my foreign language requirement, but after my positive experience in French 15, I may take more French classes at Harvard.",

      "Anyone looking at qreports for it is likely deciding between this and LS1A. I think both have a lot of ups and downs. For LPSA, the coursework may be too demanding for someone with no experience but very slow for anyone with any AP experience. I took this class because I was worried about my chemistry knowledge. The last time I took chemistry before this course was sophomore year of high school, and I never learned about solubility or acids and bases. I found this class to be very easy and boring at times. I definitely don't regret taking the class though. Many of my LS1A peers were much more stressed out than I was. If you are worried about the pace being too slow, probably take LS1A. However, I have heard from LS1A students that they end up learning very little. I did really like the teaching staff. Tucci is super interested in the subject, and he's a very lively lecturer for 9AM. I also enjoyed the demonstrations, and the labs were very nice. I especially liked my lab TF. Dr. Boselli is very nice too, and she's always willing to answer questions.While I did not attend help rooms, I was told they were extremely helpful to most students. If you are worried about receiving support, I strongly recommend LPSA. The staff will help you with any questions you have step by step. In terms of exams, as far as I'm aware, the LS1A exams are much easier. They are given a cheat sheet, and people say they're easier than the PIEs. However, LPSA still has plenty of prep materials for the exam, and a lot of students do extremely well on them. I would recommend this course.

Students will further develop competence in both analytic (using pencil, paper, and multi-variable calculus) and numerical methods (using the Python programming language) to model simple physical systems and to analyze experimental data.The course is aimed at second year students who have an interest in pursuing a concentration in the sciences or engineering.

The person who graded our psets was very unforgiving, so people often performed really terribly. The average was about 80 for the first few psets it was pretty bad. The material is also just much more difficult to digest, and the lectures aren't very helpful for our learning. The labs are also pretty unrelated to our learning, and the new Lab TFs were pretty awful at helping unlike in 12a.",

How was the growth and development of opera as a cultural institution affected by European expansionism? Does opera have a special kinship with secular modernity? What can quintessentially operatic figures (the castrato, the prima donna, the doomed lover, the femme fatale) tell us about non-normative identities? And what social, cultural, or political roles can opera fill in the era of global capitalism?\u00a0 Topics include exoticist and Orientalist tropes and racial costuming; adaptation of European opera across the globe; transgressions of the gender frontier; and hybrid re-interpretations and stagings of works from the operatic canon. We survey a variety of genres from Restoration semi-opera to contemporary Baroque-folk fusion, postmodern re-stagings of opera seria and postcolonial musical adaptations, television opera and the concept album; and visits from practitioners and creative artists are planned.",

You learn all about a new domain of physics that is quite different from others, but draws from quantum mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves, and even some chemistry. Professor Mundy is awesome, and does her absolute best to make the course accessible for all. Some pros of the course include: \u2013 Generous grading on Psets and Exams\u2013 Infinite time on exams (Proctored by Professor Mundy)\u2013 Small \"gimme problems\" on psets  and chill class pacing (oftentimes we would pause at the halfway point in class for a short break)\u2013 a wide scope of content (which means that if you don't like something, you will be doing something else the next week anyways)\u2013  Very nice, accessible, approachable, and knowledgeable teaching staff\u2013 Sections are essentially just pset help, and office hours are helpful too\u2013 Taking 195a primes you well to take other Quantum Materials coursesSome criticisms:\u2013 Psets can be a bit tedious\u2013  Section isn't made to answer questions, it's mainly just there to explain hard Pset problems\u2013  I don't think that the course will be taught by Professor Mundy next year, so it may have very different course structureTL;DR: Physics 195a is a great course that will teach you all about Solid State Physics, a very unique realm of physics. Professor Mundy is awesome, and the course is structured to be quite chill. The course is a decent time commitment (~7 hours per week outside of class), but there are plenty of support resources.

      "I do not know my official OFFICIAL grade, but my bet is that I got an A after my calculations. I know as an incoming freshman, I wanted to know what the student got with their perspective, which is why I am putting this here. So here's what I have to say:\u2013 If you have not taken economics before, like me, get ready to lock in. At first, it is going to seem like common sense, but it picks up quite quickly. The midterm will be more difficult then you think and be ready for that. All of the other qreports from what I read before coming was that it was going to be pretty easy, but please please please study. \u2013 If you mess up on the midterm (any students), DON'T WORRY! I didn't do amazing on the midterm, but I pulled out an A on the final, which saved my grade. It is possible, I promise! If you didn't understand the midterm that well, please go back and understand it. It will come back into the future concepts and you will only get more lost if you do not put in the effort immediately. \u2013 If you did well on the midterm, do NOT let off the gas pedal. I know students who got high A's on the midterm and get C's on the final. The class does get harder and it is not as easy as other people say it is.\u2013 Do your problem sets with one of those office hours that goes over the entire problem set. For me, this semester was with Jack Kelly, which was so beneficial for my pset grade. Psets are worth 25% of your grade and this is an easy way to help you get that A at the end!\u2013 Finally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do the Unit Review Programs. These are easy 2% extra credit bonuses on your final grade! This is what got me my A (I think). It literally could be the difference between an A and an A\u2013, so please please please go. It's like one hour out of your week, every two weeks. Just go and get your extra credit!",

Discuss with them the papers in advance and they are useful in helping you organize your ideas for the papers. The class presentations are totally feasible and there is not much stress involved. Overall, the class is great and you get to learn a lot about philosophy and architecture. Another plus is the field trips, guest speakers and out\u2013of\u2013classroom classes going to archives, libraries, etc. It's also a good course to fulfill the Philosophy Junior Tutorial requirement.",

Unlike Kau\u1e47\u1e0da Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, he also seeks to refute the old and new Naiy\u0101yikas' position that \u012a\u015bvara's desire is the basis for direct expression (\u015bakti), which itself constitutes linguistic convention (sa\u1e45keta). By separating the two concepts, N\u0101ge\u015ba carves out a unique space for \u012a\u015bvara within a P\u0101\u1e47in\u012bya's philosophy of language, which otherwise was exclusively dominated by the concepts of \u015aabdabrahman and spho\u1e6da.

Latin culture reached North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Mideast. \u00a0The main cultural medium was the codex. Manuscripts distinguish the Middle Ages from papyrus scrolls and printed books. Latin was the main language for them. Look at the course title: text and context come from the Latin Middle Ages, introduction, medieval, Latin, literary, and culture from Latinity.This course samples verse and prose, lyric, epic, comedy, biography, commentary, and theology, from late antiquity to early modernity. It explores monks and mystics, saints and sinners, women writers, Alexander the Great and King Arthur, Charlemagne and Germanic heroes, Thomas Aquinas and scholasticism, and courts and universities.

    "course_description": "This seminar introduces students to the history of work and workers in the Americas. We will examine work and labor and their intersections with colonialism, imperialism, and slavery from the nineteenth century through today. The course will also ask how working people have represented themselves, and how they have intervened to change their own lives, and, sometimes, the course of history. Our analysis will encompass racialized, feminized, and unfree labor; domestic and reproductive labor; migrant, casual, and emotional labor, as well as the labor of the artist and the organizer. We will engage with a wide range of historical and literary texts from Latin America and the United States to consider how writers from across the Americas have used literature to consider what it feels like to work, and to refuse work. Course readings may include Solomon Northrup\u2019s 12 Years a Slave, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s 100 Years of Solitude, and Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s Lucy, as well as works from theorists such as Sylvia Federici, CLR James, Karl Marx, Kathi Weeks and Raymond Williams.",

      "PLS TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Hogan is such a delight! He's super funny, intelligent, and thoughtful about the course's readings, discussions, and assignments. The course itself is really interesting. You definitely get the opportunity to reflect on the connections between labor and meaning, as well as learn about different labor systems throughout the Americas. There's a really good and diverse focus on both North American and Latin America, as well as some details even about trans\u2013Atlantic trades and industrialization in Europe. The course is also pretty evenly covers lots of different time periods, from the 1100s all the way up to present day. This was a really great experience and I can't reccommend taking this course enough!",

Topics include both model-free and model-based RL algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO), actor-critic methods, and model-based policy optimization, with a focus on continuous state and action spaces. Additional topics may include Lyapunov analysis, vision-based feedback control, and advanced convex optimization.

In this seminar/lecture course, students will learn about transplanting functional human cells (such as pancreatic beta cells or dopaminergic neurons) derived from pluripotent cells to treat disease. They will also discover how to use these cells to\u00a0model\u00a0diseases, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, with the goal of\u00a0identifying\u00a0more effective, possibly patient-specific, therapeutics. Students will hear about treatments, including small molecules (conventional medicines), whose therapeutic actions can be attributed to the regulation of tissue-specific stem cells that reside in key adult tissues including the bone marrow and brain, but, interestingly, not including the heart or pancreas. Finally, they will be exposed to relatively new work that demonstrates the possibility of creating new cells from old by using genetic methods to swap cell identities.\u00a0A typical type of question that we will debate is: When should Parkinson\u2019s disease patients be treated with a drug to slow the death of neurons, with transplanted neurons made from pluripotent cells or with a viral vector that produces new neurons from existing glial cells in the brain?\u00a0This course will highlight the theoretical, as well as the practical, aspects of drug development. How are therapies progressed from conception to patient (bench to bedside)? How can academic investigators commercialize research? Importantly, while this is a science course, not a health economics course, we intend to discuss ways of reducing drug costs. At the same time, we will introduce the new trend of treating rare (even N=1) genetic diseases and how this is or isn\u2019t accommodated within our existing healthcare framework.\u00a0We believe that students with different backgrounds (biology, chemistry, engineering, business) and at different levels (undergraduate, graduate) can benefit from taking the course and will help enrich the discussions by providing different perspectives on topics that we\u2019ll cover.

      "This course is wonderful!! Meditation is now part of my personal routine because of this course. Throughout the semester, you really gain an understanding of the neurological concepts involved in meditation and related topics. You also gain a basic understanding of Buddhist philosophy. There is quite a bit of complex reading for this class, so make sure you are ready for that. You will also be presenting one of the readings throughout semester, which I found to be extremely helpful. Definitely take this course if you are ready to fully engage with it\u2013\u2013\u2013however, this would be a very difficult course to only put half of your effort into.",

      "Most truthful opinion about Math19a:this class traumatized me but this is still one of the most amazing and rewarding classes I have ever taken. This class changed my perspective on math and life sciences! Professor Wes is the kindest person ever. He genuinely cares so much about this class and the students. He will help if you ask him. (I literally asked him to teach me about the most basic things in course and he always was so enthusiastic about teaching and learning) He genuinely will help you if you just email him. He did say he sympathises with the students a lot because he knows the class and its expectations.The class is difficult. Especially if you are coming straight from AP Calculus BC. That said, I was recommended for MAth ma twice but I chose to take this class. Keep in mind i had excellent grades in Pre Calculus and calc bc and got a five on the test. But, this class is still challenging. There are no MQC or help\u2013rooms, only office hours from CA and Wes, BUT these are more than enough. They are so so helpful. Make sure you form a study group/pset group it will help. Start psets early. I know everyone says this but to be caught up with this class, this is so so necessary. Like, other math classes do not have intensive readings and very fast paced lectures that never seem to stop. SO START EARLY. find your buddies. changed my life when i went into the weekend knowing i tried to do the pset fully even though i skipped some questions. PSETS are meant to be challenging, dont get discouraged. YOu will get a hang of it. Midterms are tough, learn to manage your time. I would not say they are not representative of the class lectures or the psets. Start studying for it early! Do your cheat sheet! Put whatever Wes gives you on the cheatsheet because it will help.The final project is what makes this class very different. But the professor is there with you every step of the way! He literally will work through thanksgiving break for you. Very very helpful and never denies to help.Take this class IF: you are very curious, dont think grades are everything that matter over learning. If you're a pre\u2013med, although you do not have to be. If you want to look at life sciences from a different perspective that will change everything. If you want research experience with a really amazing professor and class environment.Don't take this class if you are not the above things.Be cautious. It is not hard to get good grades in teh class if you start early and study hard. Very very rewarding. Would not take this class again but I am eternally grateful I did once.",

      "Chem 110 is a good course, but has some caveats. The content of the course is definitely the biggest strength: it was super cool to see how to apply chemistry and biology to therapeutic development, which is very much still an emerging and prevalent science. Professor Shair is extremely knowledgeable, and as the founder of a biopharma company (Nuvalent) himself, he knows all the ins and outs of the industry. However, the course does have some quirks and drawbacks, namely, the workload, community, and office hours and feedback.\u2013 Workload. On average, this class is not a lot of work at all, but the workload is just extremely concentrated. There are only 5 assignments: A section presentation on a week of your choice, 2 Psets, a Midterm (which is a glorified Pset with less time and no collaboration), and a Final Project. On weeks when you don't have any of these to do, the course is extremely chill, only about an hour of out\u2013of\u2013classroom time for the week (you only need to read a paper for section and that's it\u2013 lecture attendance is not recorded and you can watch it whenever you want). However, on weeks when you have one of these assignments to do, be prepared to GRIND. The psets and midterm are a grind, which took me ~20 hours to do for each. The final project was not explained very well, so be prepared to put in A LOT of work for it. \u2013 Community. The class is like 70% grad students, so if you're in undergrad, you probably won't find many new friends with similar experiences in the class. The grad students are still chill on average, don't get me wrong, but don't expect this to have the same undergrad community as Chem 20/30 or 17/27.\u2013 Office hours and feedback. The TFs are pretty good on average, but their feedback can vary wildly based on who your TF is. In office hours, some TFs were overly gatekeep\u2013y about the answers,  while others were much more clear and would tell you if you got the problem rightOverall, Chem 110 is a good class overall, but it has some quirks. I would still highly recommend the course if you have interest in therapeutics, since you will learn a lot, but just mindful of the class's weak points.",
      "My main gripe with Chem110 is that grading is very particular and MOE (software) assignments are long and vague. Pset and midterm questions are very vaguely worded so that you don't know what you are looking for. Office hours can be frustrating as the typical response is that MOE is glitchy and people may get variable results. To be honest, variable results is not fun to work with for a class homework assignment. Regrade requests are highly variable in outcome.The plus is that the course material (lectures) is good. Very relevant stuff. Take the course if you want to learn more about drug development, but prepare for some occasional disappointments.",

Small sections are great, you get to actually do Math in class and even to know your classmates. Exams are super fair: they prepare you with much more difficult practice tests, which is good (heard of the opposite for many other math courses!).

These initiatives were probably informed by the Africans' legal cultures, as many of them came from societies where slavery was practiced. Our seminar puts African legal regimes (customary law, Islamic law) at the center of our explorations concerning slaves' legal actions in the Americas.",

      "A thoroughly enjoyable class. HT is a great professor, and it is a real honor to be able to learn from a man with such deep, encyclopedic knowledge of the field. The material is also simultaneously incredibly broad and deep (there's just a lot of it!), and I've really come away feeling like I've learned a lot about systems and efficient ML more generally.The PSETs were very manageable, the midterm was not that bad, and the quizzes were annoying and tedious but they only lasted for the first half of the class. Definitely a pretty tough class, but it's all so worth it.The final project is really interesting: the constant feedback from HT makes it unusual in that you are guaranteed to have something good, that you can be proud of by the end, but it is also the highest expectation I've ever seen for a final project at this university (not like, a PhD thesis like i saw a previous comment say, but definitely non\u2013trivial and you need good, novel results, which are not always easy to come by).HT is also the greatest PowerPoint user I've ever seen, his slides are fantastic and unlike any other prof's.Sit in the front row to be able to follow lecture closely, do not give into the temptation to pull your laptop out when you get confused, and interact with the staff as much as you can, it's just uniformly good for you to do so.A great way to knock out the systems requirement at the undergrad or AB/SM level. 10/10 would recommend and take again.",
      "I do not recommend this course, and I say this as someone who was very excited to take it and was interested in this line of research. There are too many issues, and even the opportunity to learn from such a professor as Prof HTK does not make up for it. \u2013 You cannot hear him during lecture. He does not speak clearly, though this may not be his fault but rather a technical issue with the microphone. Either way you will go to class and hear something very garbled and the recording is even worse. You quite literally can hear nothing unless you sit right in front of the professor. He is brilliant but this is a problem that I feel should be fixed; he is capable of speaking clearly because he does every 30 minutes or so for one or two sentences and then you cannot hear anything again. \u2013 The course staff who are hired to answer your questions seem to not like it when you ask them questions. If you ask them about specifics for the coding assignments, the people I asked said they didn\u2019t know. I wondered how they did not know but that was irrelevant because no matter the reason, I did not receive help and was slightly screwed. \u2013 The quizzes are ridiculous. The questions themselves are not crazy, but the time limit of 12 minutes for 10 questions seems to be something unrealistic \u2014 as if you ask the TF about a question sometimes they take 3\u20134 mins to think of an answer, so how are we supposed to do the same in 1\u20132mins as people who are seeing the content for the first time?\u2013 Every assignment with the exception of the first will be in a group. This group may not be people you know, and even if it is, you will come to learn just how lazy and unresponsive some of your peers can be. I would in general for CS avoid group based assignment classes if you can.\u2013 The final exam requires that you remember exact things from the lecture slides, sometimes useless details. For example, they test you on a concept where there are multiple possible parameters, but instead of quizzing actual understanding they ask about what exact values for the parameters were used in class. There is a special circumstance in which i recommend you take this course1) You are actually willing to read the papers in detail and are deeply interested in hardware and software AI acceleration techniques2) You have an idea before going in of possible projects you might want to pursue 3) You are going to ask questions in class and the course staff will like you if you ask intelligent research\u2013like questions but not really about HW4) You will be a good team member, and you are willing to pick up the slack for the slackers who are not.",

While the primary focus will be on the linear model with continuous outcomes (i.e., the classic regression framework) we will also discuss binary, categorical, and ordinal outcomes. We will emphasize how to think about the applicability of these methods, how they might fail, and what one might do to protect oneself in such circumstances.

The aim is to scale and visualize association patterns in complex, multivariate datasets. Such techniques include principal components analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA), Gifi methods, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and (social) networks.The second half of the class deals with parametric psychometric methods.We start with basic elaborations on measurement and reliability, before moving on to latent variable models. Within this context we cover exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation models which allow us to model complex relationships among (latent) variables. Finally we introduce item response theory, a measurement framework for categorical data. One overarching goal of these latent variable units is to replace a naive sum score by something more sophisticated.The last unit (psychometric theory) will be held by Richard McNally where he will talk about validity, and will cover theories of intelligence, personality, and behavior genetics fundamentals.All topics covered will be supported by corresponding computations and illustrations in R, and supported by lab sections.",

    "qrating": 4.91,
    "course_description": "In the course of a few short decades, the Internet has become integral to significant swaths of human experience. It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one\u2019s right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share\u2014and, thus, to consume\u2014extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization). This seminar will provide an overview of legal doctrines that govern the online conduct of individuals and institutional actors. It will address the rights and responsibilities of the intermediaries that mediate many of our online activities \u2013 social networks, cloud-based storage services, email providers, and the like. Students will consider old and new legal frameworks and the ways in which the law informs strategic decisions for those that operate online. The seminar will address some of the most important and complex policy debates of our day\u2014regarding the proper scope of intellectual property protection; the balance between\u00a0 a robust environment for online free expression and a desire to protect against harmful speech; and the ways in which the law addresses privacy vis-\u00e0-vis both government and private actors. Readings and in-class conversations will cover legal cases and case studies, offering students a high-level view of the technical, legal, and business landscape and allowing them to delve deeply into particularly difficult sets of problems concerning the regulation of online conduct.",

      "This course provided a great introduction to online conduct, policy, and internet law. Professor Bavitz, an experienced copyright attorney, brought a professional perspective to the class, making the material engaging and relatable. His personal warmth, including his treats he would bring, created a welcoming atmosphere. He is a really intelligent person and has a stupendous vocabulary.The course offered fascinating discussions on topics like the history of the internet and its future, particularly around real\u2013world issues like online regulation. However, there is a seemingly strong pre\u2013law focus that wasn\u2019t immediately clear when I signed up and might not appeal to students looking for a broader exploration of online conduct beyond legal frameworks. Additionally, the small class size (10\u201315 students) sometimes led to an imbalance in knowledge levels, which could make discussions harder for less experienced students. With that said, if you do the readings you will be fine for the vast majority of the material discussed.The grading system was sat./unsat., with blog posts on current events and a final paper. This low\u2013pressure structure encouraged participation and was really stress\u2013free, but I would have liked there to be an option for it to be graded. Also, the focus on copyright, patents, and trademarks, while important, sometimes overshadowed other aspects of internet policy, making the course feel a bit one\u2013sided.All critiques I made are very minor though, I had a really positive experience. Overall, I gained a much deeper understanding of the internet's legal landscape and its implications for the future. This is an awesome, one\u2013of\u2013a\u2013kind class and a great seminar!",

      "Think long and hard about which math course you take. Any sense of hubris you have, get rid of it. This course may not be Math 25 or 55, but for someone who has never done Linear algebra, proofwriting, or set theory, you may very well still find yourself feeling a bit challenged. I took A LONG time to adapt to this course. Professor Wood is a great guy, and you can tell he is enthusiastic about what he does, but I must admit I felt so lost up until a few lectures after the second Midterm. To be entirely honest, I am not completely sure if its because I am just a slow student, or maybe lectures weren't as clear as they could be, but let me tell you, I really suffered my first semester because of this class. I didn't really know how to do the PSETS, the first two midterms didn't go so great for me, and there were days when I severely doubted myself. I was also taking some other Pset courses, so the workload was definitely weighing on me, so if you are a first\u2013year student also doing a lot of STEM\u2013related courses, please make sure you know how to manage your time properly regardless of which math course you pick.Just know this course might either be a complete breeze for you, or a warzone. It really depends on who you are. I certainly think Wood's lectures were much better towards the latter half of the semester, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying them (a very stark contrast to what I felt towards the start of the semester). I also think that all things considered, because it was his first time teaching this course, it wasn't that bad. I certainly believe he will do a better job next fall, and well, I have enough faith in this that I'm sticking with 22b and not dropping to 21a. If you do end up taking this course and struggle, please please please go to office hours. They saved me, and they will save you too. The CAs and TFs for this course were amazing (shout out to Zak, Josh, and Mitchell), and Dr. Wood is also particularly helpful and insightful during his office hours.All in all, like I said before, really think about what math course you take. Do I regret taking 22a? Honestly, at first, I thought it would be a resounding yes, but honestly, the course grew on me. Yeah I struggled a ton, and you might too, but it's in those moments where you truly learn who you are as a person and a student. The truth is, I may not leave this course with the greatest grade in the world, but I learned things from Wood's lectures, I learned things from the other students I worked with, and I learned a lot from my study sessions. So I guess take 22a if you're like me, unsure about where to start with math at Harvard, not wanting to do something as extreme as 25 or 55, but wanting a little more to prepare you at the start of your college journey.",
      "To preface, this is coming not from a student that didn't do well in the class, but from someone who eventually got an A in the course. At first, I decided to pay close attention to the lectures and the lecturer, but after the first and second midterms, I quickly realized that the reason I was not doing well is because the lectures do not properly cover the material at all. Professor Wood just does problems on the board without teaching students how to properly think through the problems, which does not work at all. In fact, reading through the textbook also revealed that some of the concepts we learned in lecture were taught in completely the wrong way. After this, I decided to not pay attention to the lecturer and learn on my own, and this resulted in me doing well on the third midterm and the final. My success in the course was due to the fact that I realized how terrible the professor is at teaching and learned how to teach the concepts to myself. If you are somehow that prioritizes productive lectures and a professor who actually teaches properly, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",

This has been its goal for hundreds of years and has produced astonishing breakthroughs from population genetics, to general relativity, to plate tectonics. Artificial intelligence is touted as a tool for learning about a complex system in ways that humans can\u2019t and has seen exceptional progress in natural language processing and image identification. In this class we explore the emerging linkages between scientific inquiry and artificial intelligence. The central goal of this class is to question the classical role of the scientist as a creator of theories and consider how scientists may become interpreters of theories developed by AI. We do this by developing an understanding of how AI systems actually work (they\u2019re astonishingly simple), explain recent success cases, and then consider how we may (or may not) rebuild science in an AI-first manner. Examples will be drawn from the earth and planetary sciences as well as the life sciences.",

      "As much as I wanted to like this course, I felt that it was underwhelming this year. In my opinion, the part of this class that could be improved the most were the students. In class, there would be multiple people on their computers that didn't contribute to discussions, and only a fraction of the class would actually be engaged. With a different group of students, I think that this course could be significantly better, but this year, it felt more like a lecture class compared to an actual seminar. I still don't know most of the other students well, which I feel should be a key part of first year seminars. In addition, some of the readings were dry and technical, and the class has a large focus on how LLMs work\u2014which was somewhat helpful for context but also took away time from discussing the implications of AI in science. However, this class has a relatively light workload, mostly 10\u201320 page readings/annotations per week. Brendan is also an incredibly knowledgeable professor and has years of experience in the field. While he was a bit pessimistic at time, his insight was extremely interesting. I also found the final project quite fun. Overall, if you are interested in the subject, this class has the potential to be fantastic, as long as you are alright with the possibility of just sitting through lectures.",

    "course_description": "This seminar is intended to illustrate how research in mathematics actually progresses, using recent examples from the field of algebraic combinatorics. We will learn about the story of the search for and discovery of a proof of a formula conjectured by Mills-Robbins- Rumsey in the early 1980's: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices. Alternating sign matrices are a curious family of mathematical objects, generalizing permutation matrices, which arise from an algorithm for evaluating determinants discovered by Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll). They also have an interpretation as two-dimensional arrangements of water molecules, and are known in statistical physics as square ice. Although it was soon widely believed that the Mills-Robbins-Rumsey conjecture was true, the proof was elusive. Researchers working on this problem made connections to invariant theory, partitions, symmetric functions, and the six-vertex model of statistical mechanics. Finally in 1995, all these ingredients were brought together when Zeilberger and subsequently Kuperberg gave two proofs of the conjecture. In this course we will survey the story of the alternating sign matrix conjecture, building up to Kuperberg's proof.\u00a0 If time permits, we will also get a glimpse of very recent activity in the field, for example the Razumov-Stroganov conjecture.",

To meet these goals, we will read a substantial portion of the Quran in translation and draw extensively on modern academic scholarship on the Quran. In addition, lectures will contextualize and complement our encounter with the Quranic text and secondary scholarship. By the end of the semester, students should have the ability to utilize various resources and concordances in order to independently conduct further investigations and critically evaluate claims made about the Quran.

      "Life and Death in the Anthropocene was a really interesting class \u2013 the readings were fantastic, and the conversations we had in section were organic and thought\u2013provoking. The course covers a wide range of perspectives on the climate crisis, from different diagnoses of its origin (capitalism, imperialism, religion, etc.) as well as various approaches for solving it (via technology, policy, social change, etc.). This class exceeded my expectations in the sense that people were engaging really deeply with the readings and I always looked forward to the conversations we would have in section about the material. My TF, Ashton, was super incredible as well \u2013 he was really the ideal TF: kind, understanding, honest, and excited to teach.But \u2013 and this is a BIG but \u2013 Naomi Oreskes is an exceptionally poor professor. She is very likely the worst instructor I have ever had, not just at Harvard, but in my life. Naomi is opinionated and self\u2013centered. She brings a \u2018jack of all trades, master of none\u2019 background to her teaching (with an emphasis on \u2018master of none\u2019), which is fine, but she is so head\u2013strong in her beliefs that she ends up teaching her students things that are just patently false or internally inconsistent with other things she has said. The lectures present a one\u2013sided interpretation of the causes and solutions for climate change, and sorely lack critical discussion of different perspectives or fact\u2013based analysis.Let me first give a disclaimer. Naomi seems like a good person. She seems friendly and like someone who would be easy to get along with in other aspects of life. But when it comes to discussing the climate crisis and how to solve it, Naomi is one of the most ignorant people I have ever met. And the fact that she force feeds her own beliefs to her students \u2013 when these beliefs are based off of incorrect information or internally inconsistent assumptions \u2013 is unacceptable.Here\u2019s one example of Naomi simply not understanding the content she tries to teach. We had several lectures about the shortcomings of nuclear power \u2013 mainly that nuclear power plants take a long time to build and that nuclear fusion still isn\u2019t commercially viable. That\u2019s all great. But at one point, when criticizing small modular nuclear reactors, Naomi argued that small modular reactors will never be as cost\u2013effective as larger nuclear plants since building smaller reactors means they won\u2019t be able to benefit from economies of scale. This statement reflects a fundamental misconception of economic theory: economies of scale have nothing to do with the size of the product itself. In fact, the entire purpose of building small *modular* nuclear reactors is that they are modular, and therefore can be mass produced in factories and then transported to sites for installation, rather than having to be custom built each time. Small modular reactors are designed exactly so that they can benefit from economies of scale, in contrast to traditional nuclear power plants. It\u2019s remarkable that at a school like Harvard, home to some of the top economists in the world, there are still professors like Naomi who do not understand Econ 101. And this is just one example of Naomi teaching things that are just objectively incorrect.Naomi is also constantly contradicting her own beliefs. Throughout the entire course, she presents internally inconsistent beliefs about the importance of technology and scientific research. On one hand, she stresses that the US federal government has historically played a major role in many technological inventions, and should be seen as an equally valuable source of innovation as the private sector. On the other hand, she is highly skeptical of government investment in clean energy technology R&D today and derided the French government for investing in nuclear power. I left the course confused about what Naomi really thinks about technological solutions for climate change, and honestly am not sure if she has a coherent opinon on technology. Naomi tends to cherry pick success stories and failures to teach to the class, and it ends up painting a patchwork picture of climate solutions that doesn\u2019t yield any coherent conclusion. It feels like she just latches on to certain narratives she hears in the media, and doesn\u2019t really critically evaluate her own beliefs and consider if they are internally consistent or not.There was another lecture where she spent half the time convincing us that going to Mars was not a viable solution for addressing climate change. We know, Naomi, we know. You didn\u2019t have to spend 45 minutes monologuing about the difficulty of timing a launch so that Earth and Mars are closest together or about the governance challenges of establishing an extraterrestrial colony. This is yet another example of Naomi not really having anything meaningful to teach, and just offering a semi\u2013coherent rehashing of her shower thoughts with questionable relevance to the course.Naomi is also quite self\u2013centered. We would barely go a single lecture without her name\u2013dropping one of her celebrity friends, or her bringing up that she was invited to give a talk at XYZ conference, or that some news station interviewed her, or that her book has been made into a film, blah blah blah blah blah. It honestly just felt professionally inappropriate.You might be wondering about Naomi\u2019s qualifications. She has a PhD in geology, and is now a professor of history of science. Why did she make the switch? She told us in lecture that history of science was a less competitive field than geology. I\u2019m not sure what part of her academic background makes her qualified to discuss the engineering or economic challenges of climate change. And I would have thought that any professor who is teaching content outside of their field of expertise would have at least taken the time to create lectures that are factually correct and logically consistent with each other, but that did not seem to be the case with this course.So Naomi, if you\u2019re reading this, I ask you to please reconsider the way you teach this class. You are obviously capable of running a good class, since you are a tenured professor and have been teaching for decades, but I fear this course is over\u2013ambitious in its content and the lectures are often not grounded in facts or logic. I hope that you can be just a little more moderated when you are presenting your own beliefs and that you really fact check everything you\u2019re saying before you teach it to dozens of undergrads. If you really want to inspire the next generation of climate leaders, you need to re\u2013evaluate the way material is presented in lecture. I hope that you can encourage your students to think critically about the complex causes and solutions of climate change, rather than force feed them your personal beliefs that can be premised on factually incorrect statements or internally inconsistent assumptions. You have a year until you teach this course again. I hope you can make use of it.",
      "This course is quite a lot of work; the readings are heavy and sometimes quite dense. But it is incredibly helpful in building a really interdisciplinary understanding of the climate crisis, its causes, and why it's so difficult for us to address it. You will definitely learn some really important concepts and gain new ideas and frameworks of thinking about this crisis, but you will probably also get what you put into it.",

      "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Oh my goodness it is really true when people say this is a course which they will take with them for their entire lives. There is a substantial amount of reading and daily quizzes, but that is only because this course masterfully is able to consolidate centuries worth of the most dense philosophical material \u2013 perfectly into one semester. If you take one GenEd at Harvard let it be this one, you are directly learning how to be a better person and how to live the best life. The final exams are extremely fair and do yourself a favor: do all of the readings (even re\u2013read over breaks) to make sure you've absorbed it all, it will help you in the class and in life!! Moral of the story \u2013 100000% take this class Professor Rinard is the best and Allison Bailin is the best Teaching Fellow, she was incredibly prepared and helpful.",
      "There are better uses of four credits at this school. With that being said, and GENED's starting to become less gemmy across the board, I would still place this on gem status but (in sports terminology) would not be comfortable offering a long term extension of gemminess to this class. Relative to other GENEDs, easier, but more effort required (reading checks, etc.). As a GENED, decent. This class is slightly more annoying than it needs to be. No lecture recordings or slides. Mandatory attendance.",
      "Professor Rinard is the best! She is always connecting the sometimes overly intellectual philosophy topics to real world examples and anecdotes from her life to help our understanding. She was super engaging to listen to and I would highly recommend meeting with her to discuss the topics further; she is a wealth of knowledge. I originally took this class just to get the gened requirement out of the way but ended up truly loving the readings and material I learned. If you do the readings, the quizzes are very easy, and I would definitely call this class a gem. TAKE THIS CLASS even if only to hear Prof. Rinard's interesting and amusing lectures! You won't regret having a deeper understanding of finding fulfillment as a human."

The very name, \u2018avant-garde\u2019 (from French, literally \u2018advance guard\u2019) carries military connotations that suggest a total, violent break with the past. Our seminar will look at another side of this radical change, asking whether the avant-garde might also be playful, rather than violent, making possible an interplay between invention and convention? And what is the afterlife of the avant-garde? How did its legacy inform aesthetic innovation in a later period? We will try to answer these questions by studying a small set of textual and visual artifacts from the long twentieth century, cutting across different continents and political formations. We will begin with conceptual experiments of the Dada and Suprematist groups and Italian and Russian Futurism and their convoluted relationship with Fascist and Communist ideologies. We contrast these historical examples with later work, like that of Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys. We will consider cinematic experiments of Dziga Vertov and Jean-Luc Godard, ending with David Lynch\u2019s radical displacement of the reigning ideology of Hollywood in his 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive. This nearly century-long framework will allow us to investigate a range of artistic, social, and political mobilizations of the term \u2018avant-garde\u2019.

    "course_description": "Cities today face broad challenges ranging from public health emergencies (e.g. Covid-19), to anti-police brutality protests (e.g. #ICan\u2019tBreathe), and unemployment. Stuck in a frustrating period of \u201cwaithood\u201d or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustrations is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Pharrell Williams and Chris Brown, are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the \u201cAfro-Cool\u201d in the United States. This, of course, raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation. \u00a0In this seminar, we ask: In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people\u2019s opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we will watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the \u201chustle economy\u201d in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city.",

Our training in literature analysis is comprised of two related components: (1) eight weekly seminar-style, small group paper discussions with pairs of Harvard faculty instructors that will focus on understanding, dissecting, and evaluating a dozen seminal research papers; and (2) parallel weekly sections led by teaching fellows that focus on the process of peer review and revision of two different scientific manuscripts. In separate sessions, you will engage groups of professional journal editors or faculty members in panel discussions to explore the process of peer review and publishing from different perspectives. Then, toward the end of the course, you will plan and outline your own study design for a current or future project (e.g. current or future rotation), thus applying many of the elements that you have considered in the various section discussions.

      "Oh boy... Real Analysis. First and foremost, there is no getting around this. This class is hard. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly: The good: This is a difficult class, which sometimes can be made more difficult due to: idiosyncracies, arbitrary grading, and unnecessary difficulty on assignments. YMMV,  but there wasn't a lot of that under Prof. Max Weinreich. That's not to say the class was perfect. But it also was not horrible.  Max was a great lecturer, but a little monotone sometimes. He was hard to reach outside of class/OH. The midterm was fair and we got a nice curve. The bad: However, some things you should know: Your experience in the class will depend a lot on who the professor is, and how many times you go to office hours a week. Some Psets were easy and doable, others were near impossible unless you went to OH. There were two WONDERFUL CA's, but other CAs were not as good. The first few Psets will be graded as if you were a mathematician, and errors will cost you. Then, they relax the grading. This tends to be due to different reasons, but I like to think is to give you a false sense of improvement. There's arbitrary grading and you should reach out when this happens. The ugly: Some problems were hard enough that CAs even had trouble solving them. If a CA doesn't know how to solve a problem... that will tell you. This is my general guideline: If the Prof is writing their problems, you'll be ok. If they are choosing problems from Rudin, then good luck. This was a WAY better class than last Fall, which under all metrics was a horrible experience for everyone. The final exam was rough. Instead of testing knowledge of a definition or theorem, you need to realize \"the trick\" that each problem requires. This is more on intuition than true knowledge. We were given a review sheet of 10 problems and told to study it intensely. Only 3 problems showed up in the final and one of them was *heavily* modified. It should have been a take\u2013home or something. TLDR: Max is good, other profs may not be. OH is the most valuable resource for Psets. If exams are in person, they will be difficult but hopefully curved. Find friends and build a study group!",

I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the course for a while, but I think it ultimately comes down to the fact that Neil tries to cover way too much content but doesn't go deeply enough into any of it. I think the course is generally too theoretical, and I'm not super sure how to use most of the material that we covered.

This disparity between law-on-the-books and law-in-action has prompted social-legal scholars to closely examine the latter.This course adopts a law-in-action approach to explore the intricate relationship between law and society. We will explore major theoretical perspectives and empirical studies that analyze the dynamics between law, legal institutions, and their social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Topics covered include, but are not limited to: (1) concepts and theories of law and society; (2) the experiences of various actors in the legal system, particularly lawyers, judges, jurors, and litigants; (3) the dispute resolution process and its intersection with culture, social class, race, and gender; (4) the impact of law on social change; (5) law, surveillance, and technology.To foster a global perspective, the course will not be confined to the US context but will include examples from other societies as well.

The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike.

      "I would recommend this class! You get to learn a little bit about a lot of languages. You won\u2019t go into too much depth on any one language, but it gives you a pretty solid foundation to continue learning if you want. This class has people with very different experience levels and backgrounds, but I think it does a pretty good job of catering to everyone.You can find all this information on the website, but basically you get assigned a section according to how you rate yourself from least comfortable to most comfortable with the material. Each week there are usually harder and easier versions of the pset, and you can choose which to do. If you do both you can keep the higher score. The default grading system for CS50 is Sat/unsat, but if you want to count it for a concentration that requires a letter grade you can switch to letter graded.The difficulty level and time commitment will depend a lot on what your experience with different programing languages is, if your taking the class graded, and if you go to office hours. For example, I only had experience with Java, so I was pretty relaxed during the first half of the course because c and python were pretty similar to Java. The website programming was a struggle for me though and I had to put in a lot more time to understand it.If you have a lot of CS experience you might want to think about going straight to CS61, but you can still learn a lot even if you have programming experience. For example, I did AP compsci and one class on data structures in high school, and for me it was definitely the right move to take CS50. You can just choose a more comfortable section and do the hard and easy programs for each pset.Starting early on the psets if you think you might run into problems is really helpful, because you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration by going to office hours! (There are sunday office hours in widener and smaller ones you can schedule with a TF) The CS50 debugger is honestly pretty confusing for me compared to something like eclipse, so for debugging you kind of just have to ask the ai duck or a TF.I thought this class was a fun experience, and it was a good way to meet people. There are lots of optional events like the puzzle day, hackathon, lunches, and CS50 fair.",

      "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! No matter what your concentration is, you won't regret taking CS32 because in our world where everything is becoming more and more digitalized, having some experience in coding (Python is the language used in CS32) with whatever you do is super beneficial. The concepts from class are so cool and interesting and the homework never feels like busy work because they actually push you to utilize your knowledge to solve the challenge at hand. The course really tries to help students manage stress while doing CS during a busy semester. All the PSETs come with a week of extension time in case you need it. As long as you are not abusing the system (like you actually needed time to figure everything out as a beginner), you'll be fine! The PSETs also offer a safe space for learning because four of the five PSETs don't expect you to be perfect to get a good score. Instead, they just want to see serious effort, logical thinking, and decent usage of knowledge from class. If you put in serious effort, the final code and grade will honestly take care of themselves. The small quizzes throughout the semester are also low stakes (four to five points each) and their main purpose is to act as checkpoints for your understanding. They are meant to be straightforward and beneficial than anything else, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. Ask questions if you find yourself confused at any point. There will be a mix of emotions ranging from determination to frustration to ecstasy, but at the end of the roller coaster, you will walk away feeling proud and satisfied of how much you grew and were able to accomplish. Definitely spread your time out in completing the PSETs because scrambling to finish the code all at once isn't going to cut it. Besides, you will get so much more out of the class if your understanding/epiphany moments are gradual. Definitely go to office hours. Everyone in the staff team is so helpful and kind. And make some friends in CS32! They will make your experience that much better and the memories I got from this course are ones that I love looking back on.",

The assignments are very reasonable and though sometimes time\u2013consuming, honestly pretty fun; the section component is also fun and ties in well with course concepts.  I really enjoyed the film viewing sessions every Thursday night and actively looked forward to them throughout the week.  This is the rare Gened that actually ended up being one of my favorite classes I've ever taken in college.",
      "I recommend you take this class if you are interested in \"Japanese\" media! The professor is an expert in film, shows, and other media from Japan. The class is mainly about what it means for something to be \"national\" as opposed to \"transnational\" or \"universal.\" So most of the time is spent talking about or considering that one idea. There are also other interesting topics in the readings, but the other main idea is analyzing films from Japan.  The screenings can be a little annoying because of the timing, but it's nothing unmanageable. I really loved the content, so I think this class is worth taking, overlooking the tedious and time\u2013consuming video essay projects.",

How might the study of the New Testament's social and historical context relate to its ongoing role as sacred and/or authoritative in the Christian tradition?\u00a0And what are some of the diverse ways that contemporary readers bridge the gap between the New Testament's ancient Greco-Roman context and their own interpretation and application?\u00a0We will explore these questions through careful study of the New Testament texts themselves, while also attending to issues of historical context, methodology, and hermeneutics.\u00a0No previous study in religion or ancient history is assumed, and there are no prerequisites for enrolling in the course.

      "If you're interested in ecology or conservation, I would recommend this class. Professor Taylor is incredible, he's a great lecturer and very passionate about ecology. Professor Moorcroft is also very passionate, but his lectures are less engaging. Overall, this class is very doable, if you apply yourself you can learn the material, but there isn't much holding you accountable for learning the material(only 4 PSETs, and 1 midterm) so I recommend doing a little bit of self study every week; this will make the PSETs and exams much easier. Also, the field trips are really great but don't procrastinate the write ups because they do take some time. Overall, this a great class for ESPP and IB concentrators.",
      "You will learn a lot in this class and the professors are very experienced in the field. However, the disorganized nature of this class made it hard to recommend without reservations. Be prepared to have to adjust and change your schedule on a whim. Also, it is difficult to know what we should be prepared to do. For example, the final exam formula sheet we were given was from 2 years prior and had formulas we hadn't even learned in class. The midterm scores ranged from 99.5 \u2013 64 and was definitely a time crunch. If you have no background in ecology it can be hard to intuit some of the questions and world problems. The final felt better than the midterm but study a lot!! It is very easy to lose points.",

      "This class was my favorite this semester. Stephanie's teaching style may not be one that works for everyone\u2013\u2013it's a little unorthodox and she does sometimes ramble\u2013\u2013but it really worked well for me. It was clear that she is incredibly passionate both about what she was teaching and about her students and their well\u2013being, even to the point of buying the whole 30+ person lecture cookies/donuts multiple times during the semester. She was also very knowledgeable, particularly about genres and technical elements. She and both TFs were both very available through office hours and email, and you would earn extra points for seeking feedback from them before turning in an assignment. She was definitely a stricter grader than my TF, but both left detailed feedback and grades that I thought were reasonable. Stephanie graded 4 out of 5 assignments, and I could tell she was getting to know us as writers/matching our writing to our contributions to class discussions as the semester went on.Structure\u2013wise, I really liked that the class defined literature as \"anything with words,\" because it meant that we got to study music and film/TV as well as poetry and novels and plays. Stephanie also made an effort to represent different types of voices/characters in what we read, which I appreciated, and she asked for our preferences towards the end of the semester, which meant that we got to watch Fleabag and analyze it! The reading was reasonable (up to a short book per week, but usually a dozen poems or a short play or a couple of songs), and our TFs worked to make all readings available for free (!!) through the library so that we didn't have to buy everything being taught ourselves. Stephanie also seemed to have connections to everyone and was able to set up Zooms/in\u2013person visits from something like 60\u201370% of all of the authors/creators we studied, including Dessa, Monica Yoon, and Danez Smith. It was so so cool to be able to meet the creators of what we were studying and ask them questions about their work/life as a professional artist. In terms of assignments, you could choose from 20 creative and 20 analytical prompts, and the class encouraged you to take risks by dropping your lowest creative assignment grade at the end of the semester. I also appreciated the built\u2013in peer workshops and opportunities for discussion in section. Both Manan and Imani were incredible and so so knowledgeable about what we were studying!I wouldn't say that this class was easy, and I definitely had to work hard (especially on my written assignments), but I found it to be really rewarding and enjoyable. Take this class with an open mind, participate in class discussions, and really dig deep into the assigned reading :)",
      "The course itself depends a lot on the professor and TFs. The curriculum is chosen by the professor, and although they try to select a range of literature, it is likely that the majority is in a field that the professor is more knowledgeable in. The lecture style also wasn't something I particularly enjoyed, with most of it being asking questions to students about their thoughts on the readings, and many awkward pauses when no hands were raised (many people weren't even paying attention). Section was also rather lackluster, with my TF not being super passionate + only really figuring out how they wanted to structure the section more than halfway through the semester. Again, though, how these things turn out really depends on which professor/TFs are leading the course that semester",

How are we to think about the strong emotions they evoke and learn to resist as well as appreciate their power? This course revisits Geoffrey Chaucer's classic fourteenth-century poem, The Canterbury Tales: the deepest and most caustically entertaining analysis of storytelling ever written. The Canterbury Tales consists of a series of tales told by members of a pilgrimage on their way from London to Canterbury, representatives of the internally divided social world of Chaucer\u2019s England. Some are serious, others funny, obscene, or offensive; some are religious, others not at all; some deal with issues local to England, others range across the Europe and the rest of the known world; many are told against other pilgrims. Written in a long-ago past, the poem jumps off the page, in turns unrecognisably weird and startlingly modern. We read the poem in the language in which it was written, Middle English, easy and fun to learn with early help: no previous experience with the language, or with the medieval era, is necessary. We will also explore the poem's long-ranging impact on English literature, including several contemporary reimaginings. Classes include a short lecture on a tale, and class discussion, which continues in weekly sections. Course projects include an essay, a collaborative report on one tale, and a creative option. Students of all years and from all concentrations and programs are welcome.

Professor Wilson made everything digestible. And her lectures are substantial and generally wonderful to listen to.Professor Wilson is highly knowledgeable. Come to her office hours. Get her feedback on the final project. Ask her questions during and after class. You'll be glad you did. You'll come away from this class having learned that much more if you choose to engage with her. She's awesome.Assignments are VERY fun.

The other assignments were also very creatively designed. The final project was a joy to do \u2013\u2013 something I'd be excited to go home and work on \u2013\u2013 and it was by far my favorite final this semester. ALSO, for your copy of the tales, GET THE E\u2013BOOK.Being able to search in the text was a lifesaver. Highlighting and annotation were a part of the deal, so there were no disadvantage to not having the paper copy. And I paid $20 less than I would have for the paper copy. Highly recommend.

      "SUCH A LOVELY COURSE! ES51 FTW! But definitely a huge time commitment!!Hi! If you're deciding whether to take ES51 or not, the question is simple: major/requirement\u2013wise, do you need to take it? \u2013 If so, take it as soon as possible! The skills learned in the course are so useful no matter what career you choose! I'm glad I took it in my Freshman Fall because I now feel much more prepared and certain about following a career in Mechanical Engineering.\u2013 If not: are you willing to take the challenge? This class is a HUGE time commitment, and it is really not worth it if you won't be able to put in the effort. If you decide to take it: this class is worth every single atom of dedication you can offer. Seymur is not a particularly good lecturer, but he is probably the sweetest person in John A. Paulson and he makes a real effort to get to know his students individually. He always stays after class taking any questions you might have, either about the content or about a career in Engineering. It's clearly that he loves his students! Class and lab often didn't have a very clear connection, but lab was so cool! I learned so much. If you can, stay in the lab after hours, and take your time to really explore all the resources available to you. This class is not only an intro to Mechanical Engineering, but also a wonderful intro to Engineering at Harvard as a whole and the resources at the SEC. Don't come into this class with a mindset to do the bare minimum \u2013 the more you put in, the more you take away. Befriend your TFs and understand that there is truly a lot of help to help you navigate ES51. With that being said, Turf Wars was a magical way to wrap up the semester, and I feel like I'm walking out of this class with a real community of Mechie peers and friends!",

Professor Girguis is AMAZING! He is so passionate and excited about his profession and very well connected. There are field trips and ROV demonstrations which is so cool. Would also highly recommend to non\u2013STEM majors looking to take a STEM course, you will learn a lot but you don't need really any STEM background to take it.

The lectures were well structured, and all materials and recordings were posted online. The provided textbooks are great, and I highly recommend you read on each chapter before/after lecture. There will always be some confusing bits \u2013 I still went to office hours just about every week \u2013 but that's how it always is. The biggest strength this class has are its psets. They aren't easy, but they are super fair, well structured, and give you the chance to practice the same ideas at least a couple times so you feel like you've gotten the hang of them by the end. This class won't be easy, but I never once felt like the work I was putting in wasn't going anywhere.ES125 is exactly how all of your engineering requirements should be \u2013 they will not all be this way, so just enjoy 125 while you have it. Conversely, if you take 125 early on and really don't like it, I would seriously recommend you reconsider engineering. It doesn't get much better than this, and it sure gets a lot worse.",

The course will cover topics general to design research with discussions, assignments, and readings focused on three main themes in relation to architectural design: Discourse, the development of a proposition for the role and significance of architecture relative to the project topic of interest; Method, the design steps/process of working through a design application/inquiry of those ideas; and Context, the relationship of the project topic of study to broader surroundings which include but are not limited to the discipline of architecture, cultural contexts, technical developments and/or typologies. The seminar will emphasize and support the translation of ideas emerging from independent research into visual forms of representation including, but not limited to, drawings, diagrams, images, study models, and shortanimations.

In this course we\u2019ll look at recent Latin American literature that establishes a sometimes productive, other times disruptive relationship with archives and criticism, in contrast to previous works that have delved into the archives for their literary production. Delving into the pressures and challenges faced by contemporary Latin American authors such as Jazmina Barrera, Mariana Enriquez, Fernando Vallejo, among others, as they navigate the dual demands of producing literature that is both critically relevant and culturally resonant, amidst the backdrop of archival extractivism and a fast-evolving literary landscape, the course will offer a panoramic approximation to how intertwined literary production and literary criticism can be, and the consequences this has on both the literary field and academia. The combined concepts of critical obsolescence and archival mining aim to explore how these forces impact the creation, reception, and interpretation of literature in Latin America. Authors seem to find themselves negotiating between the vast historical and cultural tapestries available through the regions\u2019 archives and the demands for fresh, relevant narratives in a global literary market. This places a particular type of pressure on authors and critics in Latin America to continuously innovate or react to new developments, which can render previous interpretations quickly obsolete, but that also assume certain tightness in regard to the possibilities of the hermeneutical process itself.",

Each week will feature Harvard faculty whose research is related to these GHPs. Maybe it's the origin of life, dark matter and the structure of the universe, or cracking the code of human aging. They will make a pitch to serve as your academic mentor, and together, you'll plan an undergraduate curriculum focused on building the skills and knowledge you'd need to tackle your chosen GHP. You'll also study historical cases where seemingly impossible problems were solved, often by young researchers with fresh perspectives.By the end of the seminar, you'll have a clearer picture of the scientific landscape and where you might fit into it. We hope that some of you will embark on a tailored academic journey here at Harvard, aimed at equipping you to address some of science's most profound mysteries.

      "If you are thinking about taking Chem17 vs Chem20, choose chem20. You will not regret it one bit. 1) Your grade will be ok/about the same in both classes. A lot of people (pre\u2013meds) worry about their grade and think that Chem20 might give them a worse grade than Chem17. The reality is that most students in both classes end up with A/A\u2013. Chem20 has harder exams/lower exam averages, but your final course grade is curved, so it turns out perfectly fine. 2) You get a deeper understanding of chemistry with Chem20. Chem20 takes the time to introduce MO theory immediately and goes into greater depth on why each reaction you learn happens. It begins to teach you chemical intuition so that you can look at a molecule and immediately have some idea of its reactivity. In short, the course teaches organic chemistry by logic and reasoning rather than sheer memorization. 3) The course materials are FAR superior to Chem17 or ANY course you've ever taken. I'm not kidding. The course is so organized that you get 2 booklets on day 1: a bound booklet of the lecture notes that you fill in during lectures and second, a book of practice questions for each module of material. The exams, problem sets, and practice questions are all similar, so definitely do the practice questions. There are so many practice questions that mimic the conceptual and the synthesis questions on the actual exams very well. 4) Lab is actually sort of fun. The head lab TF Dominic will hopefully still be there. Dominic and Co. make lab super chill but still informative. The course  is a bit weird in that lab doesn't seem to count a lot towards your final grade, but imo, this actually helps you focus on lab and really enjoy learning the techniques (whether you end up using them in your future career or not).5) You get so much support. The TFs, PSLs, and ofc Professor Liu are all so willing to explain concepts/exam problems to help you improve over time. Actually, the best part is that you are assigned Pset groups with other students. This means that, unlike many other classes where you may struggle to find people to work with, you start the class with a pset group. ALSO after every exam, there is a group exam where you get to get some points back on the exam by working in another assigned group. The group is randomly assigned and changes each exam. This means that you get to know pretty much everyone in the class.Tldr: Take the course. Grade will be fine. You learn SO MUCH. All assignments are designed to prepare you well for exams/teach you a lot. You make many friends. Keep in mind that as we write these reviews, we have no clue what our final grade will be (that's the case for all classes). I've had some cases where I write positive reviews for classes, get a bad final grade, and regret writing that review. I'm here to say that regardless of my final grade (which again will be fine), I would 100% recommend this class to everyone who has any slight interest in chemistry at all.",

      "Take this class!! As a humanities major, having this science class in the mix with my English and writing classes was a great way to give my brain a break from writing and reading and analyzing. I found the workload super manageable but didn't feel like an easy pass \u2013 grading is not harsh but learning from feedback feels super necessary to advance. Readings are really interesting \u2013 if you have the time, DO ALL THE READINGS!! They make a world of difference when you're listening to lecture, but also for material understanding overall. The readings Desmond picks are always super interesting and if you're interested in a specific topic, make sure to focus on the readings. The lectures are great but sometimes found myself drifting off. If you miss a lecture, you're not completely cooked but I would recommend going to all the lectures! It's new material every week and can be hard to catch up if you miss something, especially if you miss two in a row. The lecture slides are great to refer to, but Desmond says a lot of stuff that doesn't make it onto the slides in lecture. Assignments are great and can be procrastinated if you're a procrastinator. Super doable in the night they're due, but actually really helpful. I felt like the writing I did every week helped me to study for the final! And my writing improved so so much from TF feedback. She's super empathetic and doesn't punish you for the learning curve in academic writing in the beginning of the class. I felt like I was seeing my work improve with her help.",

The course begins by introducing some misconceptions that many people might have about what makes for a satisfying life. We will then examine the psychological biases and other mental quirks of our mind that make it hard for us to identify what actually makes us happy, and we will then discuss what recent research reveals about factors that promote happiness. Importantly, throughout the course, students will be invited to apply these strategies in everyday life. In other words, we will both discuss what new results in cognitive science suggest to anyone interested in better understanding the factors that promote happiness, and also actively put these scientific findings into practice. Along the way, we will review historical and cross-cultural views on the meaning of \"happiness\", discuss the limitations of scientific approaches to the topic, and identify aspects of modern life (especially modern life at Harvard) that make it difficult to develop habits that support happiness.

Can wars be just? What makes a good leader? This seminar will use texts and art from the Catholic intellectual tradition to explore how Catholic thought can be applied to contemporary challenges, as well as areas where there may be tension between such thought and contemporary ideas. While the seminar addresses the thought from one particular religion, it does not assume any prior knowledge of Catholicism, much less religious belief. Rather, this seminar is for the curious, who are interested in engaging with the Catholic intellectual tradition, and exploring how its ideas interact with contemporary life. These ideas will be presented through a combination of original texts, more recent essays, art, music, architecture, and movies. Due to the wide range of texts and subjects covered, this course relies on several guest lecturers that have expert knowledge in particular aspects of Catholic thought.",

Applications are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including physical, financial, and biological-epidemiological problems. The course consists of two parts: 1. Basics: essential elements of computing, including types of variables, lists, arrays, iteration and control flow (for, while loops, if statement), definition of functions, recursion, file handling and simple plots, plotting and visualization tools in higher dimensions. 2. Applications: development of computational skills for problem solving, including numerical and machine learning methods, and their use in deterministic and stochastic approaches; examples include numerical differentiation and integration, fitting of curves and error analysis, solution of simple differential equations, random numbers and stochastic sampling, and advanced methods like neural networks and simulated annealing for optimization in complex systems. Course work consists of attending lectures and labs, weekly homework assignments, a mid-term project and a final project; while work is developed collaboratively, coding assignments are submitted individually.",

The teaching staff was excellent and so helpful, the lectures were mostly interesting and useful, and the homeworks were fun and mostly not too challenging. Go to George for help, he's the best.  I couldn't survive this class without chat gpt, so that's also a great homework assistant.",
      "I would say that the lectures are the most useless part of this class. You are much better off looking a the filled notebooks and the psets and doing the work yourself instead of following along in class.",

The course staff really care about you and your learning and go above and beyond to make the course content and all aspects of the course as accessible and supportive as possible. They teach you to code well without any background or experience to the point where I started using course concepts and coding for other projects and assignments in my other courses. If you are in engineering, please please take this course for your CS requirement; it's a gem!"

I applied a lot of knowledge from this course in my other classes!When it comes to the format of the course, I can't think of a more comfortable place. Everyone could voice their opinion without judgment, and since the number of people was small, it was possible to really give many important issues proper attention during the discussion. Being the only freshman, I learnt how to do college assignments properly and even improved my writing skills! Professor Choi was always very supportive and understanding! And every class she brought us snacks and gave us feedback after class, which I really appreciated.I was really worried about the final project, but Professor Choi helped me choose a topic, and I even ended up enjoying the process of doing it. Definitely the fact that the project can be made very creative helped a lot of people to be more creative with the assignment.In general, everyone should definitely take this course, because it is truly a treasure trove of knowledge!",

This course pursues two guiding questions: how has anxiety changed throughout history and how has it stayed the same? And how have authors throughout history productively channeled anxiety into creating beautiful and meaningful works of art?\u00a0Through a combination of readings and fieldwork, we\u2019ll investigate anxiety\u2019s potential causes, from the universal fear of death to the more historical contexts of urbanization and self-optimization, for instance, as well as its various treatments, such as stoicism, self-help, and psychopharmacology. The course combines practical and theoretical perspectives to examine the relation between anxiety and creativity and to engage with various aesthetic responses\u2014from comedy to literature and film\u2014to the troubles of being that anxiety designates. Smaller weekly assignments will include slow reading, technological unplugging, and proposing one improvement to the mental health culture on campus. Final project may be scholarly, creative, or a hybrid of both. Students will emerge from class readings and discussions with an understanding of anxiety as a social formation, literary preoccupation, and, when harnessed, a spur to aesthetic invention and political intervention.",

      "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Blum and all the TF's are incredibly smart and generally amazing \u2013 they have so much to offer and so many stories to tell! I particularly enjoyed throughout the class when Prof. Blum would connect our content to memories she had from her childhood. At one point, we were talking about \"cosmic insignificance\" and she talked about a memory she had from her childhood where she thought \"I'm completely alone in this\" \u2013 it made me feel so seen!! You also have to meet with her for a 15\u2013min meeting once throughout the semester  so she can get to know you a little bit. I think all of these aspects make the class feel much better since you feel so connected to her/she knows your name/you feel more at ease with volunteering your answers in class. The class itself also has a very welcoming environment and you should definitely volunteer/answer the questions that Prof Blum poses to get the most out of the class (it's also completely OK if you don't but still) \u2013 it's very low stakes and there are so many interesting people taking the class (at least when I took it) with whom you can have discussions with \u2013 it's what Harvard is all about!! The guest speakers are also people with incredible insights, and the readings are very well\u2013connected to lecture content. There's also a good general structure/flow to the class, it begins with more ancient philosophical readings from Stoicism/Epucureanism etc. and then progresses all the way up to Freud and ChatGPT. I wouldn't say this class is an absolute GEM since attendance is required, there's a reading check every class, there's a no\u2013tech policy and there's also a \"capstone\" assignment you have to complete throughout the semester, but if you do the readings (or even skim them in some instances) it becomes very easy! And I grew to enjoy the no\u2013tech policy a lot, I even started looking forward to class bc of the fact that my mind would get a break. I wouldn't say I spent any more than 2 hrs per week outside of class with the readings and assignments even on the week of the midterm and I got A's from almost everything. Overall, I would recommend EVERYONE to take this class \u2013 it truly WILL change your perception on many ways people have dealt with their anxieties and shows you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Everyone is, was, and will be feeling some type of anxiety \u2013 it's the human experience. And it's crucial to talk about it. This is what this class does.",

The course will cover key current policy developments, at the municipal, national, regional and international level. The course will discuss seasonal migration, child migration, undocumented and irregular status, gender factors in migration and the role of xenophobia in driving policy.

The main emphasis will be on early childhood \u2013 roughly the period from 18 months to 6 years but for some topics we will also discuss development through adulthood. An important goal is to introduce you to some of the major theorists in developmental psychology (e.g., Bowlby, Piaget, Vygotsky, Kohlberg) as well as more contemporary researchers.

To inspire students about the power of design in new business creation. We will address questions such as: Why is design relevant in tech ventures? How does it create value? And, most of all, why is it fundamental for a technology entrepreneur/leader?2. To enable them to move into action, by learning the theories and practice (mindsets, processes, methods) of design: Where do ideas come from? How to frame (and especially re-frame) a problem? How to understand what is meaningful to users? How to make a product desirable (functionally, emotionally and symbolically)? How to design and build the user interface of a product? How to test it? How to narrate and visualize a novel idea?3. To co-explore, with the class and the instructor, the use of design as a leadership practice: How does a leader who masters design can better contribute to creation of value? How can we forge a new manifesto for leadership, inspired by design?The course is intensively project-based. Students will work in teams on a complex innovation challenge proposed by a real corporation. They will suggest a more effective framing of the problem, and create a novel meaningful solution, with a special focus on the user interface.",

It will begin by providing students with a tool-kit for effectively fulfilling their role as TF in the remote learning environment. This will include strategies for online teaching, managing and engaging students in the virtual classroom, and effective grading and feedback methods. The course will then transition into more specific topics that may arise in the classroom, and finally expand to consider broader issues that we all face when teaching in East Asian Studies departments.The course will meet for a total of 9 times. We will meet weekly for weeks 1-4 and bi-weekly for the remainder of the semester, in two-hour sessions. There are a total of 9 sessions, as well as the expectation that participants complete the Bok Center\u2019s self-paced Canvas site before the first course meeting. Students must successfully complete the course before advancing to their general exams. Each meeting will focus on a specific skill and is intended to give students the chance to not only think about how they want to teach, but also the opportunity to put those ideas into practice before stepping into the classroom. Beyond its specific weekly agendas, the course is intended to provide a comfortable space to voice concerns, discuss anxieties, identify fears, and share successes. Students are encouraged to raise issues about teaching and professional growth.\u00a0The syllabus is flexible and can respond to student needs and concerns as the semester progresses, so please be sure to provide your feedback as we go along. The course is primarily intended for students currently in the fall semester of their G3 year, although G2 students are also welcome to enroll in the course. For G3 students, this is a chance to use actual materials from your assigned course to prepare for leading discussion sections in parallel with the demands of the semester. For G2 students, who will not yet have a teaching assignment, you will be asked to consult with your advisor about what course you are most likely to teach in the coming year, obtain a syllabus used in previous years for that course, and prepare for class activities based on those readings and potential lecture topics.

This course investigates the history of fears\u2014and hopes\u2014regarding the massive technological ruptures of the 20th century, a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization punctuated by two technologically sophisticated world wars. We\u2019ll focus on how technological change has been represented across a range of cultural texts\u2014including films like Fritz Lang\u2019s\u00a0Metropolis, speculative fiction by W.E.B. DuBois and Ursula K.

Students will gain insight into the cultural, economic, and religious practices that shaped Morisco identity during this transformative period.

The expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain in 1609 represents a pivotal moment in their history, and this course will provide an in-depth analysis of its causes, consequences, and global impact. The Diaspora section will examine the migration of the Moriscos beyond Spain's borders, with a particular focus on their settlement in North Africa. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will examine the Moriscos' contributions to art, literature, science, and philosophy in their new environment, as well as the challenges they faced in maintaining their distinct identity.\u00a0Students will engage with scholarly articles and contemporary accounts to develop a nuanced understanding of the historical trajectory of the Moriscos. By the end of the course, students will have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of Morisco history and its enduring impact on the broader cultural and historical landscape of the Mediterranean and beyond.",

    "qrating": 4.85,
    "course_description": "When Bad things Happen Early in Life: The Effects of Early Adversity on Brain and Behavioral DevelopmentDecades of research tell us that the foundations of healthy development are built early in life. Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may increase risk for a host of chronic physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and addictive behavior; it can also lead to a variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety and characterological problems. Science clearly indicates that the longer we wait to intervene on behalf of such children, the more difficult it becomes to achieve healthy outcomes. This constraint is particularly true for children who sustain the wear and tear of early exposure to so\u2010called \u201ctoxic stress\u201d. In this seminar we will critically examine the range of adverse early experiences that impact children growing up in both low and high resource countries. Key themes include a) the nature of the adversity children are exposed to, b) the timing of the adversity c) the chronicity of the adversity, and d) individual differences (including genetic and environmental factors that may confer protection on children exposed to early adversity). We will pay particular attention to the short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes on physical, neurological and psychological health.",

    "course_description": "As the number of children who speak, or are exposed to, more than one language increases in U.S. classrooms and in classrooms around the world, educators at all system levels and across varied settings must be prepared to provide high-quality, rigorous education to ever more linguistically diverse groups of students. Designed for researchers and practitioners, this course focuses on the pressing issues related to bilingual students' language and literacy instruction. The term \"bilingual\" in this course will be used to refer to a variety of students who have diverse and unequal experiences in more than one language and who speak or hear a language different from the societal language at home, but who might receive bilingual or monolingual instruction at school. The course employs an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on sociocultural, psycho-linguistic, and educational frameworks of research conducted in the United States and in various international contexts. A number of societal factors related to language, literacy, and academic achievement will be explored: the many modes of being bilingual or multilingual, the role of linguistic minorities in society, the role of educational resources, and the impact of educational policies on bilingual populations. The course will provide opportunities to discuss and investigate the literacy development of bilingual learners, reflect on the important contribution of literacy skills to academic achievement, and learn and reflect about research-based instructional approaches.This course is intended for students who anticipate working with linguistically diverse populations as practitioners, policymakers, or researchers.",

In fact, recent history suggests things are typically much more complicated: negotiations between the disputants commonly play a critical role in ending armed conflict. One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will initially introduce students to some core ideas relating to negotiation and bargaining theory. Through readings, we will then explore how several wars in fact evolved. We will ask why did the war begin, and did the disputants first attempt to avoid armed conflict through negotiations? To what extent, if any, did negotiations between the combatants end the fighting? We will see that while the expectations and aims of the combatants are typically deeply opposed at the beginning of a war, over time they often converge toward an agreement to stop fighting. In such cases, what produces this convergence? To what extent do factors far removed from the battlefield - economic, political, and social \u2013 contribute to the success of negotiations?In addition to readings, students will engage in a few negotiations related exercises and simulations in class.",

    "course_description": "The purpose of this course is to acquaint someone completely new to the religious traditions of South Asia with Hinduism as a lived experience. It is meant to introduce students to ways of life that are informed by the most prominent sub-traditions of Hinduism today as they are reflected in the different versions of the Hindu calendar, also called Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45ga or Pa\u00f1jik\u0101. Building on the history of different Hindu calendars, which consist of lunar dates (tithis), this course aims to give a broad overview of Hindu religious life as it revolves around festivals, fasts, seasonal rituals and pilgrimages that comprise each version of the calendar. Students will begin this journey with the Lunar New Year of the Vikrama Sa\u1e41vat calendar, which coincides with the end of the Spring Festival of Nine Nights (Caitra Navar\u0101tri) dedicated to the feminine divine, \u015aakti. After exploring the many ways in which the same event is celebrated in different regions, students will progress through the calendar towards the end of the year, learning about other major Hindu festivals along the way. Because of the diversity of religious perspectives in the sub-traditions of Hinduism, often the same events on these lunar calendars are imbued with multiple meanings and celebrated in various ways, so this course will put a special emphasis on learning when and how religious events are tied to entirely different mythologies and theologies, and how that creates opportunities for pluralistic encounters. Furthermore, since not all traditions under the umbrella of \u2018Hinduism\u2019 agree on one New Year or one supreme deity, the course also delves into alternative New Year celebrations, the deities and mythologies honored by them, and the issues of caste reflected by them. Throughout the course, students will learn about the ways in which devotees structure their lives around sacred dates, such as the birthdays and anniversaries of their chosen deities of worship, as well as commemorations of other mythological events. In addition to this, they will gain a perspective on food, visual art, dance, and music as aspects of life regulated by the Hindu calendar. Finally, the course will highlight cross-religious experiences, as certain major festivals transcend religious boundaries and share a history with some non-Hindu festivals that coincide with them. Knowledge of Sanskrit, other South Asian languages, or prior background in South Asian religions is not required for this course.",

Students learn how epidemiologists and clinicians today think about social determinants of health, especially racial disparities in care and outcomes. We conduct deep dives into topics like the sociology of mental illness, maternal mortality, the Affordable Care Act, Covid-19, and the medical ecosystem here in Boston. We consider normative questions, like how to balance cultural competency or patient autonomy with the medical mission to provide care and prevent harm. Finally, students also observe how public health researchers make use of social science methods, from the ethnographic case study to the clinical trial. This is a junior tutorial.",

In consequence, differential privacy is programmable: one can combine simple differentially private computational primitives in creative ways to obtain privacy-preserving algorithms for complex analytical tasks. The course will cover (1) the basics of differential privacy: the definition and its properties, computational primitives, and composition theorems; (2) selected advanced differentially private algorithms drawn from the literature and a wide range of application areas from industry to the US Census; and (3) applications of differential privacy to validity and replicability of data analyses.",

Whether from the Left or the Right of the political spectrum, if statements about political opponents are to be believed, there are Nazis everywhere. Leaving aside such facile comparisons and analogies, this course offers an in-depth case study of Germany's path from a democracy full of promise and possibility to that democracy's collapse into tyranny, war, and the Holocaust. We will work extensively with primary sources including contemporary eye witness accounts, political and economic commentary, art, and literature to explore the rise of National Socialism in the context of the politics, culture, and economics of Germany after the First World War before turning to the way the Nazis managed to seize the state, remake German society after 1933, and plunge Europe into war and genocide by the end of the decade. The course will debunk the many myths about the roots of Nazism and work towards an explanation of its rise that does justice to the complexities of lived experience between the two World Wars. With an eye towards the active nature of democratic citizenship, the course will emphasize the many junctures at which the ascend of National Socialism could have been prevented by people from the various corners of interwar Germany's political spectrum.",

    "course_description": "Debates about when adolescence ends and adulthood begins often lead to judgements about how long youth today are taking to reach adulthood and uncertainties about what it means to become an adult. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one\u2019s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?\u00a0 Should these conceptualizations change or adapt to the times? Are young people today trapped in an extended adolescence? Some experts and the popular press contend that young people today are coddled and more resistant to growing up than were those who came of age a generation or more ago. Conversely, other experts and many young adults today find that growing up is harder\u2014harder to launch a career, burdened by student loan debt, harder to find a compatible life partner\u2014in general, harder to achieve the life their parents have. Amid these debates, it is unclear what is meant by adulthood and whether it can or should be defined by the same markers as have been used in the past.\u00a0 Today\u2019s young adults are charting their own path\u2026or are they?\u00a0In this seminar, students will define and redefine adulthood based in multiple contexts, considering catalysts and impediments on the pathway to adulthood. Using a historical lens, we will examine and understand the contexts that elicit longer and shorter pathways to adulthood, including the role of the economic context, educational and occupational opportunities, gender, and the need to co-construct adulthood with others.\u00a0 Whereas societal factors are often considered contextual, this seminar focuses on societies as active agents in shaping adolescents\u2019 beliefs about adulthood and struggling with and sometimes against adolescents as they navigate their place as adults. This seminar takes a global lens and focuses on the ways in which the transition to adulthood is a dynamic and co-constructed concept and will aid students in developing an integrative understanding on societal needs and pressures and young adults\u2019 tools in navigating the path to adulthood.",

    "course_description": "By determining and interpreting\u00a0facts from roughly 753 BCE to the present, this course explores major issues\u00a0relating to Rome\u00a0and Romanness. Self-definition, ethnicity, and identity can be\u00a0fascinating, especially when probed by looking at people from different\u00a0times\u00a0and places. Self-discovery is enriched by fresh learning, together with discovery\u00a0of others.In a sense, there is only one Rome,\u00a0and it has been styled eternal. At the same time, many Romes have existed. To start\u00a0at the\u00a0beginning, why were the Romans called Roman? What was it to be a Roman\u00a0citizen?Moving on to Late Antiquity and beyond,\u00a0let\u2019s look at why there was a New Rome or Second Rome, and why it is fair or\u00a0unfair\u00a0to talk about Byzantine culture. A related puzzle, why does the\u00a0thirteenth-century Islamic poet and mystic Rumi have that epithet? To\u00a0turn to religion,\u00a0we have the expression Roman Catholic. In matters of Church and State, why was\u00a0the Holy Roman Empire Roman?\u00a0Incidentally, what makes Roman Law Roman?Why did Romans speak Latin\u2014or\u00a0did\u00a0they all speak Latin? Why did other languages develop that have been termed\u00a0Romance?\u00a0\u00a0Why do some fictions qualify as\u00a0romances? Why are feelings associated with love romantic? Why does a kind of art\u00a0and architecture go\u00a0by the adjective Romanesque?A few big, overarching questions: What\u00a0claims to Romanness have been made for the US? Why was there a Third Rome\u2014and\u00a0where\u00a0was (or is) it? Which has been more Roman, Russia or America\u2014and is that good,\u00a0bad, or neutral? What is Roman today?",

      "This class is fantastic!!!It is so much more accessible than what it may seem on the surface. They definitely weed out at the beginning, and you must be serious about taking this class. It is conceptually difficult, but VERY well structured, and if you\u2019re willing to put the time in, you are 100% capable of learning. That being said, heed the prerequisites. They don\u2019t say much about linear algebra, but I would strongly caution against taking this class without at least reviewing some linear algebra concepts first. It is also quite math and computationally heavy, relative to any chemistry courses you will likely have taken.The course staff are through and through phenomenal. Adam is a super engaging lecturer and I stayed interested for the entire period, which is rare. Section was helpful too.The only downside to this course is the lab. Yes, three hours of matlab a week is indeed that bad. The lab staff were super fun and made it livable, but it\u2019s a rough one. You will learn a ton from labs (mainly how to stay alive and not completely crash out for 3 hours while your homemade spectrometer decides not to work). However, some of the labs were only loosely related to lecture, and when you have three midterms, and lab isn\u2019t covered intensely, it\u2019s hard to lock in. There is simply too much to do for the rest of the class.The final project is fun if you pick something good. You have to seek your own help, because they throw you in the deep end. When they mention a potential project topic during lecture, PAY ATTENTION. Those deadlines sneak up on you, because they also overlap with the third midterm. The third midterm was also the day after H\u2013Y weekend, and the second was after family weekend, so keep that in mind. It does feel like you\u2019re constantly preparing for a midterm, but with no final exam, you can\u2019t really complain. Overall, STRONGLY RECOMMEND. You need to be committed to this class, but it will pay huge dividends. Super awesome course.",

We will examine Mexico\u2019s diversity of food, drink, and cultures across time and space with evidence from archaeology, anthropology, climatology, botany, genetics, history, and more, to investigate how and why various changes in Mexican cuisine took place. The origins of menu items like tacos, burritos, guacamole, and margaritas reveal critical changes in global foodways\u2014not just in Mexico\u2014that continue to shape our everyday lives and the world as we know it today. You will leave this course with a better understanding of where your own food comes from, and how you have been impacted by changes in food and food culture, both in the distant past and more recently, as well as how some Mexican food practices are influencing models for healthier and more sustainable food systems.We all need to eat and drink each day to nourish our bodies. Yet how often do you pause to think deeply about why you eat what you eat? Your food habits are likely influenced by family traditions, but also by a range of other factors like income, ethnicity, religion, politics, and the environment, which are facets of our lives deeply rooted in the past. What does the food we eat tell us about ourselves, as individuals, communities, and countries, and has humanity\u2019s relationship with food changed over time?

But, as historian Martha S. Jones (and many others) has shown, Black women have always been at the \u201cvanguard\u201d of affecting positive change in American society. This course sets out to look back to the 20th century to examine conditions under which Black women lived in the early days of Jim Crow and the role that Black women and non-binary people have played in shaping politics, grassroots organizing, the legal bar, and higher education during Jim (Jane) Crow and beyond. Through the archive and the personal papers of Pauli Murray, June Jordan, Angela Davis, and Flo Kennedy, we will see the human side of these themes and the Black Freedom Struggle. What did life look like for Black women during the Nadir? How did these people navigate gender and sexuality while pushing for civil rights? How did gender, sexuality, and intersectionality impact their political ideologies?Though many scholars argue that the law is autonomous, Critical Legal Studies scholars and Critical Race theorists argue that the law is subjective. In \u201cRace, Gender, and the Law through the Archive,\u201d students will see the subjectivity of the Black women and non-binary people who helped push for social and legal reform. Some of these women/people shaped the law as attorneys (Pauli Murray and Flo Kennedy). In contrast, others shaped the law and visions of freedom through their activism (Murray, Kennedy, Angela Y. Davis, and June Jordan), teaching (Davis), and art (Jordan). Through their avenues of influence, all of these women/people, whose papers are housed at Harvard\u2019s Schlesinger Library, wielded the law or helped shape it in the twentieth century.",

You and your peers are given space to establish the creative norms of the room. Thus, the class really is what you make it. You work with your peers on original work and receive feedback from each other and the instructor. The instructor also brings in a lot of great guest writers from a ton of different genres to talk to you. He puts a lot of thought into exposing you to great work by great writers. He also asks the students for their art recommendations and treats these with equal reverence. The instructor is fantastic \u2013 one of the best creatives at Harvard. The entire curriculum is designed to hold dignity and respect above all else in the writers room \u2013 pretty cool. He's very honest about the television industry in a way that's refreshing to hear.  His teaching style is unconventional, and does not follow the traditional workshop set\u2013up. He will encourage you to stretch your writing and try new things. If you want to grow, you'll love it.

Why do some eat cake while others nibble on roti? Why, in other words, do some people have a lot but others so little? This course uses the tools of the social sciences to examine the distribution of human well-being, or inequality. Together, we will survey this distribution across three broad eras of human history: the pre-agrarian era (until about 5-10,000 years ago), the agrarian era (ca. 5-10,000 years ago to 200 years ago), and, especially, the modern world (ca. 200 years ago to the present). Our primary goal will be to answer empirical questions\u2013to describe and explain these distributions\u2013but we will also consider the normative challenges that lie behind them. What kinds of inequalities should we care about? And, given what we know about inequality today, what should we demand that people and governments do about them? Topics covered will include: the nature of early human societies, the origins of agriculture, the rise of the state, the birth of capitalism, the causes of racial inequality and patriarchy, and the transformation of capitalism by social and political movements.",

I will say that it definitely is more history\u2013focused than I had thought, but it's easy to connect these historical topics to our current day. But, honestly I would take any class that Adaner teaches regardless of the topic.  It's clear how much he cares about his students, both as scholars and people.  He holds \"coffee chats\" after class where students can sit with him and discuss anything that they're interested in.  Everytime someone asks a question he'll nod and say \"great question\", regardless of how good the question actually is. Its clear that he wants to provide an environment where everyone feels comfortable to express their opinions and contribute to the class.",

In addition to that for the final you had to create a presentation in the same way he does and as someone who could never understand the way he teaches I really struggled with that. In addition to that there wasn't much help, clarifications, or even examples given to us to help us with the assignments which further added to my confusion especially for the last assignment. Finally, I think the way the tf graded the assignments was incredible difficult and unreasonable, he would take off points for petty things that didn't quite make sense under the explanation that the proffesor wanted to make sure not everyone recieves an A in the class and finds it easy which is quite silly to me",

Using research from psychology, political science, and economics, and focusing on case studies, the course will explore the ideas behind several arguments: 1) big problems are rarely resolved with comparably big solutions, but instead are better met with small acts of reform; 2) coalition-building among strange bedfellows is usually indispensable; 3) agents of change fare best when they look to measure their impact and never lose sight of the real world results they seek, rather than the expressive highs along the way; 4) informational \"cascades\" are possible and critical, as people follow one another; and 5) group polarization can be both desirable and dangerous, as groups become more heated and more extreme.",

He is genuinely invested in the students and the content he is teaching.  I think everyone should take this course because it really opens your mind up about how people think \u2013 both the logistics and practical nuances as well as more philosophical and personal nuances \u2013 which is really important in today's polarized political environment. I genuinely learnt quite a lot about topics and issues I thought I had a good grasp of but that I actually had a pretty one\u2013dimensional view of. The readings were interesting but I highly encourage going to lecture (which is just once a week) and actually paying attention to Professor Sunstein, rather than being on your laptop or doing other work, because his lectures give you a much better understanding of topics and also helps you remember things that you might need to know for the final/midterm. Other than the content though, the actual workload is extremely easy to work with \u2013 only 4 discussion posts throughout the entire semester \u2013 so you essentially don't really have much work to do during the semester, which I think is great, because then you feel better about setting aside the 2 hours to go to lecture and really focus on the content there because that's where I believe most of the learning lies. The only times you really have to put your head down and work is for the midterm and final (also because they constitute a large part of your grade) but the work for this is also doable.

She made me excited about a 4:30pm section which is hard to do. While not overall graded super harshly, the class definitely does require WORK: more than most GenEds, and unfortunately a lot of it was busyworkish in the form of needing to write 3 150\u2013200 word reading response comments per class which usually took me multiple hours. People definitely ended up cutting corners and not really engaging in the optional readings because we had so much writing to do: I actually don't hate the homework, but it would be good if it was 1\u20132 comments instead of 3 and that would give more time to engage with the other readings. All of the material on the syllabus is really interesting and organized well: I honestly recommend just checking out the syllabus if you're interested. Like at the midpoint of the course, some lectures got a bit repetitive but it got more interesting at the end: not a lot of \"answers\" to anything but provides a fascinating framework to see the world through.",
      "I would definitely not recommend taking this class if you're just looking to fulfill the GENED req. If you're interested in folk studies, good on you, but if you don't previously have that interest, this course is hard to get into.  The definitions of terms in the discipline are incongruent to how they're used in real life (ie. \"text,\" \"texture,\" and \"context\" all mean something very, very different from the Merriam\u2013Webster definition), and that makes the course hard to understand and hyper liberal artsy\u2013academia\u2013y. Again, if you're into that kinda thing tho, be my guest. That being said, the assignments were very unclear in instruction, very frequent, and grading is harsh in recent gened fashion. I cannot emphasize enough how unclear the instructions were for the class' assignments. Differed in substance from where they were posted (canvas, PDF version, class verbal instruction) and generally confusing. B level grades are likely amongst non\u2013folk/myth concentrators (according to my informal observation and conversations amongst peers). TLDR; for non\u2013concentrators i 10/10 do not recommend.",
      "The class in comparison to other GENEDs is low workload and an enjoyable class to take with a heavy course load. I would consider it a gem as long as you do the assignments and keep up with the perusall you should be fine."

      "This class had a good balance of assignments as an elective class. I am a STEM concentrator who had only taken ec 10a and 10b (and ec 50 but that's not needed) before this class and I would say that is really all of the preparation you need. The concepts are interesting and the class goes through following the results of influential studies which was an interesting method. It is lecture based but it was a small lecture, and not recorded so you need to go to class. The reading response assignments and homeworks were all very manageable and well spread out. For us, the final and final paper were due two weeks apart thanks to the final being on December 20, but I could see those two adding a lot of work at the end if they were closer. Other than that, I felt this class as a good balance of fair expectations, interesting learning, and time balance throughout the semester. I highly recommend taking if you are interested in the topic of finance of developing countries at all because it is a really interesting perspective on where our world is going with the implementation of technology to improve lives in developing countries.",

The Colombian writer showed his deep knowledge of Morrison\u2019s novels and Morrison thanked him as a resource for religious themes in her writings. Later, in an interview with Professor Carrasco, Morrison stated, \u201cWhen I read his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, I literally said, \u201cOh, my God, you can do this\u201d\u2014meaning magic, strange stuff\u2014and be deadly serious. So, that freed me up in my writing. Reading him unlocked something important for me. \u201dThis course is a comparative and critical study of the religious dimensions in their writings and lives with special attention to the themes of religious experience, homeland and quests, Africa and Latin America, \"rememory\" and myths, goodness and the literary imagination. We engage with four types of \u201ctexts\u201d and link them together to decipher the ties between the writer\u2019s lives, countries, politics, liberation movements and their writings; autobiographical fragments, novels, film, critical reflections. For Morrison we will use the film \u201cToni Morrison: The Pieces I Am\u201d and interviews as autobiographical fragments. For Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez we will read his autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale\u00a0and interviews. Novels include Song of Solomon, Beloved, Home, A Mercy, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Chronicle of a Death Foretold. This course will not be open to auditors.

In this seminar, we will delve into this question and what drives community resistance and social movements in the face of frequently daunting odds. We will zero in on community resistance in its many forms when confronting abusive corporations and authoritarian governments often supporting them. Through case studies involving natural gas in Myanmar, gold mining in Papua New Guinea, and chocolate in West Africa, we will discuss both the harms communities experience and how communities can have a seat at the table to demand their rights and take on oppressive systems. We will also look at how North America is implicated in these cases and consider the power dynamics between communities, advocates, businesses, and states that span borders and different cultures. We will also look at ways that communities can build their own power through the solidarity economy and how advocates cannot only combat economic injustice but build their visions of economic justice for the future.",

      "Solid class. You will spend more time on the practical application of skills (HOW to interact with communities as a human rights lawyer) rather than gaining technical knowledge of different laws, precedents, and when they are applied. Tyler is very kind to his students, I thought that because he taught at the law school, he would be intense but that was not my experience at all! He is clearly passionate about the subject and has a comprehensive understanding of the field. Readings are slightly heavier than other FYSMR classes but are certainly interesting (and yes, you do have to complete them since we spend a significant amount of class time discussing them).

      "I really disliked this class for the following reasons:\u2013 Lack of rigor. I took psy 1 and psy 16 before this, and this class did not come close to the level of rigorous treatment of the field found in either of those. In other psych classes, each lecture will be devoted to a topic where you discuss theories and ideas drawing from many different studies that contribute to the topic, and you come away with a solid understanding of some things you didn't know before and where research needs to go next. In psy 1018, each day is devoted to one or two studies that don't have anything super deep to say. (For example, a whole day will be devoted to a study finding that major key + fast tempo are associated with people perceiving the music as happy.) In fewer words, I just didn't learn much in this class. It felt more like high school than college. To be fair, part of the problem is that the research in psychology of music in general is really lacking, so this might be more of a problem with the field than how the course is taught.\u2013 Lack of focus on psychology. A TON of time in this course is spent on things that just aren't psych. The main example is the final project, where you write a policy memo recommending some policy related to music. In practice, this means that most of the final project was spent researching things like: how to implement our policy, how much funding is necessary, how to make it politically realistic, etc., rather than the actual psychological questions that underlie it. I was really disappointed with the final project because I wanted a psych class and felt like I got an HKS class instead! This takes up a lot of class time as there were also some days throughout the class where we had a workshop to work on policy memo writing or poster design \u2013 very frustrating when you want a class about the brain and music. To a lesser extent, I have the same complaint about the time spent on things like research design and quality. An example is the day at the end of the course where we debated the merits of several studies on music therapy: useful for understanding *methodological* issues but not *psychological* issues in the field. (Very important to talk about in a psych class, but I thought it was over\u2013emphasized). Overall, this class is really only partially about psychology, so be aware of this if you're planning to take the course.\u2013 Assignments. Truly none of them are particularly hard, but there are enough to keep you pretty busy. Here they are:\u2013\u2013 Reflection reports. There are 5 of these. You do a short music\u2013related activity and then write a 2 page paper connecting your experience to class literature. Kind of interesting, but you really won't learn anything profound from them.\u2013\u2013 Critical evaluation of a media article. It's a 4 page paper where you summarize and criticize an article about music and the mind. Probably the best assignment in the class. Though again, this is about research methods far more than psychology.\u2013\u2013 Quizzes. There are 2 of these. It's a multiple choice canvas quiz which is very unforgiving (e.g. 3 T/F questions rolled into one, and you need to get all 3 right to get the point). Requires you to repeat extremely specific information from studies and lectures. He LOVES asking tons of questions about which brain regions have which functions. The bright side is that it is open note/internet, so you mostly just have to ctrl + F to find the answers. There is absolutely no reason this should be a part of the course.\u2013\u2013 Final project. Poster + poster session presentation + memo. (The end of the course really stacks up because you're also doing quiz 2 and reflection report 5 in the midst of all this). And you have to submit the memo to a real politician. Anyway I said what I think about this above so I'll shut up now.tl;dr I found this class really frustrating because I didn't learn much, I especially didn't learn much in the field of psychology, and yet there is plenty of busywork.I think it is very possible that the gripes I have with this class are me\u2013specific. For context, I am a STEM concentrator + musician who is maybe doing a psych secondary but mostly took this class for fun. If you're interested in the class you should totally shop it. But my warning is this: if after a couple weeks in the class you're thinking that the class is still getting started and you're waiting for it to pick up some steam and get more interesting, it won't. Get outta there! If you're going to learn from + enjoy the class, that will happen early.In the spirit of fairness I do have some positive things to say!\u2013 The teaching team is actually very wonderful. Like even though I did not like the class, I do really like Mayron, Mehr, and Luciana as people. They are all very flexible and accommodating of whatever you have going on, so just talk to them about whatever you need and they'll figure it out. Mayron is actually a teddy bear, he is so friendly and welcoming and always has a smile on his face and brings a lot of joy and excitement about the subjective.\u2013 Music performances and activities in class were very fun!\u2013 Ultimately it is a very chill class, especially grade wise.",

    "qrating": "",
    "course_description": "Constructing a map of the connections between the 86 billion neurons in the human brain has been a goal of neuroscience since the field originated. Connectomics research, which aims to understand how the brain is wired together into this map, has shown the human brain to be a complex network with the same properties that other complex networks exhibit. Much like our social networks, the world wide web, and our travel systems, the brain demonstrates organization along similar principles as these networks and can be studied using techniques adapted from network science. Using this \"network neuroscience\" approach has shown that the brain's gray matter is organized into a functional connectome comprised of modules called brain networks that orchestrate their functions to support our everyday activities. More recently, advances in another MRI technique called diffusion MRI have made it possible to study the organization of the brain\u2019s white matter \"information highways\", or structural connectome, that transmit information from brain region-to-brain region, brain network-to-brain network. MRI-based connectomics is a rapidly growing field, with new methods and applications evolving at an incredibly fast pace and there are now numerous large-scale neuroimaging initiatives across the world that are aimed at mapping the human brain connectome. These studies aim to map the human brain connectome across the lifespan, from in utero\u00a0to the oldest old, and in brain disorders such as mental illnesses, developmental disorders, neurological disorders and other health conditions. The goal of this class is to understand how MRI can be used to study the living human brain connectome and the latest advances these approaches have revealed in our understanding of the wiring of the brain. We will also dive into some of the large-scale neuroimaging datasets to see how we can leverage these open access resources for connectomics research. This course is designed for students in the MBB programs who are interested in learning about how we study brain connectivity and how the brain is organized, including those who are interested in neuroscience applications and brain disorders and those interested in bioinformatics/computer science/statistics/physics applications in neuroimaging. To unlock the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of the sophisticated MRI methods used for connectomics research, we will learn the basics of the workhorse MRI connectomics methods, functional and diffusion MRI, from a conceptual perspective. We will learn how each of these techniques is used for connectomics studies and some key methodological and interpretational issues for each. Then we will focus on the brain\u2019s connectome. We will discuss brain organization, including how to construct a brain graph as the mathematical embodiment of the brain\u2019s connectome and how to evaluate the brain\u2019s network properties using graph theory and other approaches, the brain networks that have been reported in the literature, and the links between structural and functional connectomes. We will do a survey of widely used open access tools for connectivity and connectome analyses, and open access connectome datasets with sample sizes of hundreds up to a hundred thousand, including the Human Connectome Lifespan and Disease Connectome studies, the ABCD study, and the UK Biobank. These datasets will also be used as hypothetical data sources for your final research projects. Last, we will discuss ethical, computational, and statistical issues when working with these large open access datasets.",

In each case we will read portions of texts to better grasp the main linguistic differences between reading traditions and between chronolects, and to understand the interpretative implications of such differences. We will begin with a detailed and advanced study of the Tiberian reading tradition, whose basic features the students already know. We will then explore the less known, yet prestigious, Babylonian reading tradition, which we will compare to the more familiar Tiberian one. Finally, the students will be introduced to the so-called popular reading traditions, that is the Palestinian reading tradition and the transliterations of portions of texts and words of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (e.g., Origen\u2019s Secunda and those found in the Septuagint) and into Latin (e.g., Jerome). To conclude our study of reading traditions, we will study the Samaritan reading tradition and read portions of the Samaritan Pentateuch. With regards to periodization and linguistic diachrony, the students will be introduced to the distinctive features (mostly syntactic and semantic) of the three main chronolects of Biblical Hebrew and their respective textual corpora: Classical Biblical Hebrew (pre-exilic); Transitional Biblical Hebrew (exilic); Late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic). Epigraphic Hebrew and textual criticism will help illustrate how chronolects can be further assessed.Jointly offered with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as CLAS-HEB 138.",

Imbricating vulnerabilities exposed by plague, the Hundred Years\u2019 war, civil war, pillaging, famine, mental illness, and greed created anincreasingly untenable crisis of care. Equally unprecedented was the sensitivity of late medieval literary writers to these events. Far from serving as mouthpieces to the powerful or entertainers who distract from reality, the literary community spoke out, whether by constructing alternativenarratives, meditating on experiences of fragility and trauma, exposing hidden inequities that target the most vulnerable, or cultivating cultures of care. What can the literature of this period tell us about what it means to be vulnerable? Or what it means to encounter vulnerability with care? Can the intimate activities of writing and reading become a means of expressing, exposing, soliciting, enacting, or provoking such encounters? In this course we will explore these questionsthrough selected works of poetry, prose, music, manuscript documentary evidence, and modern criticism to discover a shared commitment among late medieval literary writers to challenge dominant discourses of power and resiliency, asserting the value of different forms of vulnerability and calling for urgently needed ethics and politics of care.",

We will read both figures in dialogue with their intellectual influences and critics to evaluate their views of liberalism, nationalism, civil disobedience, political violence, self-defense, internationalism, political theology, democracy, war, and economic justice among other themes. By studying these towering figures side by side, this course will illuminate fundamental questions about political ethics, racial justice, and the possibilities and limits of radical social change in the past and present.",

This course will offer the opportunity to track such intimate connections across history and geographies, spanning from Henry Fox Talbot\u2019s lace photographs of the 1830s, to the contemporary, with artists such as Monica de Miranda, who embroiders her photographic landscapes and Billie Zangewa, who infuses her silk tapestries with a \u201cphotographic aesthetic.\u201d With the objective of exploring how these media, their aesthetics, maneuvering and fibers have overlapped, this course will offer new frames and vocabularies to rethink each and both.",

How have struggles against gender injustice intersected and conflicted with struggles against racial, ethnic, environmental, health, LGBTQIA+ and other forms of injustice?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gender justice, as is true of justice more broadly, is often discussed in the abstract, or as a matter of law, political history, protest movements, enfranchisement, and similar phenomena. Yet at its core, justice involves individuals and their experiences - both their suffering and their triumphs - experiences most directly accessed through stories. In this seminar we'll explore a range of stories and different forms of storytelling on gender justice,\u00a0from novels and films\u00a0to memoirs/personal histories, histories, and creative nonfiction. Some narratives with which we will engage are Margaret Atwood's\u00a0The Handmaid's Tale, Ito Shiori's\u00a0Black Box: The Memoir that Sparked Japan's #MeToo Movement,\u00a0Audre Lorde's\u00a0The Cancer Journals, Cho Nam-joo\u2019s Kim Jiyoung, and Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua's\u00a0This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.\u00a0Students will be encouraged to write their own stories on gender and justice.",

Lee/Marcus Aurelius); the entanglement between working the land and enslavement and the parallels and divergences between Roman and New World enslavement; the influence of Roman landscape design and horticulture on later American landscapes and gardens; the legacy of Roman surveying methods and centuriation in the mapping of the US; imperialism and the construction of the Other (Neoclassical portrayals of Indigenous figures in civic spaces in the guise of ancient Mediterranean barbarians); the translation and adoption of ancient Mediterranean and Roman visual culture in American cemeteries (including a class visit to Mount Auburn Cemetery).\u00a0\u00a0Class visits: Mount Auburn Cemetery (reached via public transportation) and the Harvard Map Collection.",

How does database design impact how we buy and sell things? How is wood sourced and processed for the construction of housing stock? What might a bridge do besides facilitate a crossing? Each of these aspects of infrastructure can exert their influence at multiple scales and in multiple ways, often anchoring diverse landscapes of experience across populations, communities, and individuals.\u00a0In this course, we will explore how the infrastructures that organize social life are formed, experienced, and interpreted as the \u201cthings and also the relations between things\u201d (Larkin 2013) that give shape to gender, race, caste, colonialism, imperialism, commerce, environment, government, protest, and abolition. In turn, we will explore how the study of infrastructure offers a unique perspective for theorizing the \u201csocial\u201d in social theory and how imaginations of what is \u201cnecessary\u201d for social life mediate the demands we make on theory and our own research.\u00a0Materials for the course will draw on a broad corpus of readings, films, television shows, games, and technical documents across the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, history, visual studies, media studies, and science and technology studies. Coursework will involve ethnographic experiments with the local built environment and digital artefacts, the production of individual research archives, and the completion of an empirically grounded research project.

    "course_description": "This course serves as a transition between the survey nature of the sophomore tutorial and the independent senior thesis in Theater, Dance & Media at Harvard.\u00a0We engage with methods and forms of theater, dance and media which may provide inspiration for your future artistic and scholarly work.\u00a0Our strategy is to identify a number of contemporary and historical performances and performance archives and critically consider how they might influence your evolving identity as an artist working in live media, dance, and performance. We will delve deeply into genres of arts practices that could help you to imagine a way forward in your own work. In doing so, the goal is to advance your transition into a professional life in theater, dance, and media, and the identify your key concerns (both artistic and pragmatic) regarding a professional practice. Throughout the semester we will discuss how your personal goals and concerns intersect with political, social, and individual contemporary preoccupations in those fields.\u00a0\u00a0This junior tutorial is designed to organize participants into a\u00a0community of singular artist interlocutors who can also supportively engage with one another\u2019s projects. You will develop methods to articulate your own intentions and impulses with great specificity, offer appropriate feedback for the stage of development for your peer\u2019s projects, and acquire facility with terms of art in theater, dance & media.\u00a0\u00a0Our semester is oriented to gaining autonomy and independence in relation to your interests. For the first seven weeks of the semester, we will read and explore a number of topics and ideas regarding the development of a sustainable arts practice, all the while, developing a specific set of questions pertinent to each class member\u2019s interests in the concentration. At the end of the seven weeks, students will present (both in person and online) on a company or artist whose work you have been researching in depth (the options are outlined in week 7 of the syllabus).\u00a0We then pivot to your topics brought up during the first half of the semester \u2013 in essence the class will be building and completing the syllabus for the last half of October and November and December, while discussing and workshopping the development of their thesis ideas.",

It made me engage in class a lot because I enjoyed it so much and would even read a lot about the topics outside of class. Professor Hummel is absolutely amazing and very knowledgeable. She does a great job in incorporating interesting readings, some short videos in class, and captures a wide array of different views on each topic. The assignments were honestly so fun that I had a hard time sticking to the page limit because there was so much to explore. You get to dive deeper into a dictatorship and learn a lot based on your own interests in this class which is awesome! My TF Shady was also an asset to this class.

Plus, I loved the final essay prompt! Furthermore, as a white student, I will admit that I was somewhat nervous to take this highly discussion\u2013based course, especially since I am not a student who usually engages with topics of race in my classes. But the discussion culture in this class was really positive! Whenever there was disagreement or strong positions things were always kept respectable (Dr. Rhodes is great at managing discussions) and people often changed their opinions during the course of a lecture. Also, even though the class was technically listed as 6\u20138:45, Dr. Rhodes usually would let us out at 8, so if you are considering not taking this class because of how late it is, do not let that stop you! It also was not bad having a nighttime course and freeing up my schedule more during the day. There are a lot of readings in the course, but they are all pretty straightforward and Dr. Rhodes does an incredible job curating readings that are actually interesting. I have taken so many gov classes here where I feel like I learned nothing by doing the readings, but that is SO NOT THE CASE with this course.",

A big portion of your grade is the final paper and the presentation of the paper; the presentation is either done in section or in lecture, but its super bearable to do if you go over your presentation more than once. The final paper is actually so chill as long as you dont procrastinate. Professor Peterson is such a kind man who is VERY passionate about what he does, and lecture is only boring when you are not engaged. He is so full of history and it shows in lecture!!

In the real world of Washington today, this means thinking clearly about what the US is attempting to achieve in the world in the midst of a swirl of a government whose deliberations are often discombobulated by leaks, press reports, tweets, and fake news.

The lectures were truly the redeeming quality of this course, but the other components of the course brought it down. Having two essays and two written exams is a lot, especially depending on what section leader you have, and it was extremely difficult.

In particular, we will consider how the relationships between artists and audiences are constructed in the media, from democratized social media platforms to exploitative tabloids to the controlled narratives of production and industry. Surveying musicians from Joni Mitchell and James Taylor to Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, we will disentangle the contradictory knots tying together authenticity, persona, labor, and profit in the music industry. How does identity inform production and consumption of popular music, from the gendered expectation that women perform \u201cconfessional\u201d music, to racialization of genre in popular music?

For context, going into the class, I did not know how to write proofs, had some linear algebra background, and was an AIME qualifier. The class was difficult but very manageable and taught me so much about mathematical thinking. I had no idea I would enjoy theoretical math so much. Wes is an amazing lecturer and clearly cares a lot about his students. I heard a lot about the 55 community but I genuinely think the 25 community is way better. Our class is half the size (around 20 students), so everyone knows each other and I've made some really good friends through this course. The CAs are so good and helpful and chill.However, this class is a big time commitment. If you want to explore a million things in your first semester here, you might want to consider a different course. Also, exams are really hard and there is no curve, so take into consideration how comfortable you are with taking timed tests before choosing 25. If you are on the fence, I would recommend starting in 25 and dropping down to 22 if you think its not for you. 22 is a LOT easier but its a much larger class and you will learn a lot less.",

      "TL; DR \u2013 LS50 is (mostly) well\u2013taught and the community is unparalleled, but you will struggle throughout the semester (for better and for worse).In order to succeed in this course, understanding Calc II material is crucial along with some Calc III familiarity; AP Chem and AP Bio (to a lesser extent) are also recommended! Like many have said in past q\u2013reports, LS50 feels like 60% math, 40% everything else. As a non\u2013math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I'll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability/stats \u2013 taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry \u2013 Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon \u2013 very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems \u2013 Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular/classical genetics \u2013 foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma/Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle \u2013 interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics/stat mech \u2013 while, in theory, it's interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression/dev bio \u2013 Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion/chemotaxis \u2013 kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.It's important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging. I think everyone ends up with an A, A\u2013, or B+ however, this course is a profound time commitment. You will get very close with your classmates in Cabot until 4 AM some nights; you will walk away from office hours feeling like you learned how to approach a problem but must return the next day; you will simultaneous question your decision to do science and embrace the beauty of the material LS50 teaches. Overall, I recommend this course if you have a strong background but you have been warned (for better and for worse). You will meet some of your greatest friends freshman year and encounter significant challenges along the way.",
      "1) TAKE ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET. As soon as you start the class, go sign up for hours from ARC tutoring (if Jimena or Rae are still tutors for the class, sign up for their hours, they're the best!). Even if you don't need the help for the first couple of psets, you will absolutely start needing the help once the mathy concepts start kicking in. Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it's not mandatory but go anyway) because it's very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too \u2013 sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other! Basically my point here is that you will absolutely suffer in this class, but there is no medal for suffering and not knowing what's happening at all, so go get as many resources to help you as soon as possible.2) You will suffer in this class. There is no question. I don't know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it's a very hard class. You will also trauma bond with the other people in your class through the psets and exams. By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It's about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It's also not for people who don't want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. 4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night. I know we all liked to procrastinate in high school, but if you at all value your sleep in any way, don't leave things until Thursday night.5) The professors, TFs, and CAs truly truly care about you as people. They are so so understanding in terms of extensions and you can approach them with whatever you're concerned about in the course at all. They want to make sure that not only are you learning as a student but you are doing okay as a person. Overall I would highly highly recommend this class!",

The course also explains how policy makers can dampen economic fluctuations using monetary policy (i.e., government influence over interest rates and government regulation of banks), fiscal policy (e.g., government control of spending and taxation), and financial rescues in economic crises. We will also discuss how macroeconomic policies work in an international context, including the factors that affect exchange rates, trade deficits, international capital flows, and how these link economies around the world.

      "CS1090a is an AMAZING course. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm to anyone interested. I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q\u2013guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. Advantages of CS109a:0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students' learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students' understanding of the material.  1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. 2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi\u2013weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time\u2013consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10\u201320 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi\u2013weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast\u2013paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don't look back!",
      "Pavlos is great and it's easy to tell that he cares a lot. It's also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job\u2013skills wise if that's what you're going for.That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics\u2013wise. This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn't reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us \"you guys did a great job\" as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you're on track or not in the course.My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare\u2013tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take\u2013home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms/assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF\u2013ing, while student B ends up with an A\u2013 because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.",

What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place? Even if you do not live forever, is it nevertheless important that humanity continues to exist after your death? By discussing these questions about death, we will hopefully gain insight about the importance and meaning of life.",

    "course_description": "Dance is the creative expression of bodies in space and time - a centuries old art form of immediacy and feeling. Interestingly, as our lives become more digitized and removed from IRL reality, dance has gained a \u201cnew life\u201d in the virtual world, through videos on social media and streaming platforms. As stages are swapped for smartphones, what changes can be felt, for choreographers, performers and audiences? How are the experiences of attention, agency, effort, empathy, space and time different in both mediums? And perhaps most interestingly, what happens when the worlds collide, and video technology \u201cinvades\u201d the physical stage?In this course, we will be examining these questions through an historical survey of dance in media, and direct embodied research, manifesting as weekly choreographic experiments. Starting from a place of no particular presumed movement experience (ie. this class is equally for the ballet pro, breakdance influencer, and living room dancing queen) we will be investigating and inventing various methods of making, with and without technology. We will learn various techniques of capture (cameras) and display (monitors and projectors), which in turn will lead to experiments with incorporating video back into live performance. The culmination of the course will be an original multimedia public performance event, co-created with lecturers, Ali and Andy.",

The referee reports were a very good experience, and I definitely learned and matured a lot as an economist through this course.That said, if you don\u2019t find the subject matter interesting, don\u2019t take it\u2014I only loved the course because I am seriously interested in finance academia. This class will not help you get a job at Goldman in any way shape or form, so if you are an undergrad who likely wants to go into the finance private sector after graduation, don\u2019t take it.",
      "2725 (w/ Sam and Adi) is great. You survey much of the banking and corporate finance lit. and get a great sense of where it started and where its going. For undergrads, only take if you have other Finance coursework (ie. 1759) and have an inclination for academia. The workload is manageable (2 longer psets + 3 ref. reports) but you could go the entire semester without a meaningful takeaway if you come in without a solid foundation in the space.

We will ask question such as: How have mass media represented and transformed Chinese culture, history, and society? To what extent was the Chinese revolution a media revolution, and is there a media revolution going on now? How have various media served propaganda and surveillance, facilitated grassroots activism and creativity, circulated as commodities or connected communities? How have media technologies affected perception, experiences, and memories of socialism and postsocialism, as well as the aesthetics, ethics and everyday practices of every decade?

      "I spent 50 hours on the class, which is around 4 hours per week. This includes psets and reading the slides, though I haven\u2019t read most of them and I skipped lectures. I don\u2019t think I am among the best quantile in this class though.Here\u2019s the breakdown of hours by week4, 5, 7, 6, 7,  1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 2, 7, 3Well, tbh I think James has potential to be a good lecturer. His heart is in the right place.Unfortunately, I think the course is pretty badly run. The gradescope assignments are sometimes not up, and he can delay posting the assignment until a few days before it is due, and then he will say everyone gets late days for free. I remembered that he did not publish the final project guidelines until the day the first milestone is due.The textbook is also not the best. It\u2019s Faraway, and I don\u2019t really appreciate it. I think there is some value in reading the slides, and I did and did get some education from it, but it is skimmable and not the best presented (though I have seen worst in other classes, 139 slides are not that bad).If you pay attention in learning though, I think you do get some knowledge in the practical side of linear models. Sure, we were introduced to linear models at multiple points in our lives, but this class really nails it down and gives some theoretical backing and the entire backstory and a suite of theoretical tools (that have been implemented in R) to help you diagnose and validate your linear models. I finally learnt about cross\u2013validation rather completely (I did partially in ec50) and also understood bootstrap (I didn\u2019t understand it in 111). In that regard, 139 has strong potential to be a good class if it is well\u2013run.Midterm is terrible because they don\u2019t give us material like past/mock midterms to prepare for it, and the textbook is bad as I said, so it\u2019s just a ranking of who can get their shit together and learn linear models somewhere or by paying strong attention to the slides and did some own revision with other sources.The Ed is also unresponsive, but sometimes James will answer, but for the most part, God bless the STUDENT Jordan Seigel for answering Ed questions. If he becomes TF, then may God bless him even more as Jordan blesses the lucky generation of 139ers. Otherwise, Gabe the TF is good too, but I think he is graduating and he doesn\u2019t teach sections.There is a 139 handbook, but I think it needs some polish and it has some errors and not really fleshed and doesn\u2019t do tooo much of a better job than the textbook so I wouldn\u2019t spend time on it if I am crunched on time.All of the above being said, I am not in the top quintile of this class, so you should probably read some other comment that seem to know how to get the most out of this class.I would say though, that I chose this class over 244 because of the qguide reviews, and while I did learn some practical linear models knowledge, I have heard that my friends in 244 had a decent time, so I will still take 244 regardless in the following semesters.",

That being said, I absolutely loved the course. Yes, it is extremely hard and yes, it takes a lot of time, but taking 16 was probably one of the best decisions I ever made. So, if you are even the slightest bit interested in concentrating in physics, take this course, see how it goes, and drop to Physics 15a if necessary. The lecturing is known to be incomprehensible, but that's honestly just how Prof. Georgi teaches and you get used to it. The problem sets are hard, but you do them with a group, and everyone gets them done so that's not to worry. The final project is super fun, and I hope Prof. Yao does that next semester! (probably not but oh well). The course content is really good, and you learn a lot of cool physics, but rotations towards the end of the course will probably be the worst thing you've ever done (cooked all of us). However, the absolute best thing about this course is the people you meet here. I genuinely believe (biased) that Physics 16 has the best community out of any *hard* class here at Harvard, and I am so glad I took the class to meet the people I did. You bond with the whole class over impossible psets at 1am at Physics Night, and there is no better way to get to know people. Please do take the course, I highly highly recommend it. The scores are probably horrendous on this Q report, but that doesn't mean much.  Even though it is hard, everyone gets through it, just try it out please!",

He also uploads solutions a day in advance so that if you get stuck, you aren't stuck forever and can get a little hint. Midterm was incredibly fair, maybe a tad on the easier side. Second half: David L. is pretty funny and seems like a great guy, but not always the best professor. Lectures tended to run over time and we wouldn't finish all the content in models, so he made it so that sections covered new content that wasn't taught in class. Homework assignments were not clearly worded and took a very long time to complete. The midterm was also confusingly worded and on the long side for the amount of algebra required. It was also a bit strange when he pointed at an Asian student on the first day and asked if he was from Japan to make a point about economic growth across countries (the student was of Chinese origin). His research is incredibly interesting though, and his macrodevelopment class next semester sounds exciting.Takeaways: This is a required class for the PhD sequence so there is not much choice there (unless you are an undergraduate, of which there were several in this class; not sure if this class is the best choice for undergraduates since 2010A is probably a much stronger signal unless you plan on taking 2010D in the spring). David Laibson is excellent. The second half will likely change next year since David Lagakos was a visiting professor; even if he is teaching it next time, I'm sure it'll be more polished the second time around. Mixed feelings overall about how much I gained from this class.",

      "This course is great for students who have come out of the 21a/b sequence and are just generally curious about differential geometry. With that being said, it's not a rigorous introduction to differential geometry. If you want something more rigorous I'd recommend the grad version or the one at MIT. I was expecting it to be a more proof\u2013based so I'm a bit sad about that. We also worked almost exclusively in Euclidean space, which isn't great for me as I'm a physics concentrator who wanted to take this class in preparation for taking General Relativity. Oliver is also super passionate about graph theory and spent a lot of time on that which personally felt irrelevant to me and the course, but the problems on the psets were kinda cool. It's a bit sad because I feel like we didn't get the standard course where we learn from day 1 the definition of tensors, manifolds, etc. Instead we did a lot of calculation and plugging in formulas. It's cool and the course felt a bit on the lighter side but I was wishing I'd get a more rigorous introduction to such a cool topic. I say this with a bit of reservation because Oliver is such a sweet and passionate teacher. He really means well and I think he might've tried too hard to make the class accessible to students of all math backgrounds. I liked the final project component of the course \u2013\u2013 allowed me to explore something I'm more interested in. Overall, it was a cool course and I think I would've liked it more if he just stuck to a more traditional teaching method.",

      "Physics 151 has its ups and downs. Professor Jaffe is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the course topics. However, since he has been teaching it for so long, he covers some topics too quickly for full digestion. Reviewing his notes and going to section/office hours can help with this. Professor Jaffe loves it when students ask questions, so it would be wise to review enough content between classes so that you can have questions to ask. The topics covered in this class truly are interesting, but they are sometimes difficult to grasp what they physically mean due to the (what feels like) rapid pace that they are covered. However, this seems to be a good way to learn about theoretical physics. I would say pre\u2013reqs for this class are multivariable calculus and a standard linear algebra course. Some exposure to differential equations is helpful, but only basic diffeqs come up (at least you only need to solve basic ones). Shi is **THE BEST** TA I've ever had. He is passionate and knowledgeable about the topics, and he is always happy to help. He explains concepts very clearly, and he even stayed 30 minutes after section (normally 1 hour) to help us review for an exam. Nicholas is also a wonderful TA and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course contents. They both help you a lot on psets if you come to their office hours/section. Exams in this class are somewhat confusing in the sense that you don't know what will be on them, but they are not extremely hard. Just review the material from class, read the notes, go to section before exams, and learn the psets, and you should be okay.",
      "Physics 151 is an incredibly useful class. You should know this material before taking upper level physics, including before taking 143a. However, this teaching staff is going to make the class more frustrating than it needs to be, so be warned.The good side: The material of 151 \u2014 Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics \u2014 ties together all the stuff you may have encountered in prior physics classes in a way that makes way more intuitive sense. This class finally made me feel like I UNDERSTAND how physics works, which was never the case before, even when I took quantum, 181, or GR. Jaffe's notes are incredibly dense and you will not need an external textbook. If you want to do theory, this is basically required. If you want to understand where 143a came from, this is basically required.The bad side: \u2013 Jaffe is 87 years old, and it shows. Lectures are a bit slow, and he has very high expectations. He won't start without someone asking him a question, which I actually didn't mind, but he also seems to expect the students to have more mathematical background than they do, which can feel frustrating because it seems like he's disappointed in us when we can't immediately calculate something. He's also a bit difficult to talk to during office hours.\u2013 The tests are old\u2013school, with no formula sheet or study guide, and this is quite stressful; it feels like we're being tested on how much we drilled the formulas and proofs, rather than our understanding of the materials. And the grading is very harsh: many points will be removed for small mistakes (although this might just be our TF this year), and mistakes are double\u2013counted in subsequent parts of questions.\u2013 The notes are quite hard to follow on their own. I personally took detailed lecture notes and used them for supplement, and this worked well for me. Be warned that you will need to pay attention in lecture in this way (i.e. focused) in order to grasp the material, because Jaffe's notes alone will not teach you the material.The project is fine. The structure of the class works very well, and they really know what they're doing. Just be warned about what you're going to get.",

Also, group theory is a hard requirement despite what it says on my.harvard. Really should have done 122 before this (55 of course maybe can take at same time).

      "When I arrived on campus, I was told by my peers that many analogies could be made between Harvard University and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (from the esteemed Harry Potter Series by J. K. Rowling). Since my bright\u2013eyed, bushy\u2013tailed days as a freshman, I have been aspiring to discover what truly made this correspondence accurate. Is it the archaic\u2013style of the architecture found in the Yard or in Annenberg? Is it the talent and passion of the many professors, lecturers and students? Is it the things people go on to achieve after leaving each respective institution? Is it the comradery and friendships that are nurtured within the school environment and the boarding house system? All of these are certainly candidates for that which we seek, but I alas decided that none of these really nailed home the conjecture I was attempting to prove. In vain, I hence abandoned my quest. However, little did I know, coming into my junior fall, that the needle in the haystack was not only going to reveal itself, but boisterously become a defining feature of my semester \u2013 ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I present to you (drumroll, please) 'Wizardry 211: Black Magic with Probability Distributions'.\t`Wait a second, that isn't the title of the course? What happened to \"Stat 211: Statistical Inference I\" ?' you may ask. Well, that is part of the trap, because this is precisely what the course wants you to think it is. It commences unassumingly, with a beautiful first lecture on statistical philosophy and the inferential framework; the first few lectures continue on relatively unassumingly, with excellent motivation and intuition provided in class and beautiful results covered. Then the first problem set lands and you realise the true form of the evil in front of you, and from then on you realise that you are better off trying to purchase the Mirror of Erised to survive the assignments than trying to do them in any reasonable conventional manner (including nitpicking AI generated answers, as helpfully pointed out by Professor Janson). To explain a little bit \u2013 maybe it is just the nature of statistical inference research, but a very large number of problems in this course involve a 'come up with a ... that satisfies (insert laundry list) of properties and accomplishes ... task' with very few clues from the lectures, lecture notes or texts that give you a starting point or intuitions on where to proceed with this type of problem, so when you are left to your devices and expected to find out from the (often vague) prompt what exactly it is you have to do it could often feel like you are tasked with performing black magic. Like any good school of magic, Hogwarts has over the years perfected a rigorous curriculum to train its students in various forms of magic, and of course has OWL and NEWT exams in subjects such as Potions (Stat 110), Charms (Stat 111) and even Defence in the Dark Arts (Stat 210) to prepare young wizards and witches from taking on real\u2013world threats \u2013 it just unfortunately happens to be the case here that taking on the Stat 211 exams right after successful completion of these three courses is akin to what one would feel like battling Lord Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters fresh out of your NEWTS \u2013 while it is the case that there are a few Harry Potters around in the course that are able to survive this monumental task unscathed, there are many who have prepared and understood the content well who horribly fall victim to this terrible slaughtering. I'm all for difficult courses that make you work hard, but I am sure that many would agree that whilst this might be reflective of what statistical inference research feels like, this is not an appropriate way to design assignments and assess students' understanding of material.\tThat being said, this was one of my favourite classes at this school and the best statistics class I have ever taken. Professor Janson is a phenomenal lecturer who teaches with great clarity and rhythm. His lecture notes are equally excellent with a lot of great motivation and intuition given for understanding the tools the class develops and I think coming out of this I finally understood the logical framework of the subject of inference and the big picture of what it is trying to do (in contrast to the absolute mess that was Stat 111 lecture and textbook, absolute night and day difference). I really enjoyed all the topics in the course, but I thought the most well\u2013taught were the areas of non\u2013parametric hypothesis testing and selective inference which I found to have the most interesting and far\u2013reaching consequences; the technicality and rigour was definitely there but not overbearing which was nice as it allowed us to focus on statistical thinking rather than spending more time on real analysis type issues than necessary, while also making sure that what we were doing was correct (unlike in Stat 111). Definitely really really enjoyed it and felt as though it was great at helping me learn.\tSo yes, in conclusion, a course that is both amazing and very very bizarrely run. You will learn a lot from it, but I am not sure how much of the learning (and especially the assessment of how much you have learned) actually comes from the outcome\u2013based aspects of the course. In any case, I will let you make your own judgement on whether you want to do this, and whatever your decision is, I wish you the best of luck.",
      "This class, which is really only for the concurrent masters students and the G1 phds, gets a reputation for being impossibly hard and time\u2013consuming. I think this is a fair baseline. The modifications I would make to this are, starting with the good: 1) Lucas Janson does a pretty good job of giving motivation for concepts, making the lectures worth attending; 2) exams are now 16\u2013hours long and online \u2013 this makes them much more doable since you can go for a walk or eat lunch in the middle without worrying about every minute, but it is still incredibly exhausting. Next, the bad, mostly that the psets seem incredibly unmotivated, with convoluted results that are mathematically sound but are neither interesting nor applicable, and with odd degrees of rigor in the sense that measure theory is hand\u2013waved but some other tiny details are rigorously enforced. Overall much better than I expected in the sense that I came in with rock\u2013bottom expectations and only took this course (and still would only take this course) for the AB/SM, but still felt that the lectures were interesting.",

      "This course provides a unique opportunity to explore Professor Miron's consequential libertarian perspective on a wide range of major policies, encouraging students to engage with real\u2013world political issues. One of the key strengths is the flexibility of the course structure. You can sign up for any section that fits your schedule, and each section is led by different TFs or past students, which brings varied insights to the material. Additionally, the optional writing requirement is a great feature\u2014it only accounts for 5% of the grade and is graded leniently, making it an easy way to boost your grade. The grading is generous overall, with a curve, and the course workload is manageable (e.g., there is no homework). However, it\u2019s important to stay on top of the readings and class discussions. Another strength is the accessibility of lecture materials, with slides and videos posted on Canvas, allowing students to review the content at their own pace. As I anticipated, the grading structure was oversimplified: it consists of three (and optionally four) components\u2014Final (50%), Midterm (40%), and Attendance (10%), with an optional economics writing requirement (5%) that scales down the weight of the other components. This means that your grade is heavily dependent on the midterm and final exams. Given that the material on the midterm is independent of the final, it\u2019s crucial to perform well on both. The exams are mostly focused on memorizing readings and lecture material, so taking detailed notes is essential. The slides, while useful, are minimalistic (black text on a white background); be sure to supplement them with your own notes. Additionally, the slides from section meetings aren\u2019t always posted, so it\u2019s important to stay engaged and attentive during those discussions.As for Professor Miron\u2019s teaching, while his libertarian perspective is thought\u2013provoking and much of it makes sense, some of his arguments can come across as radical. At times, he would claim that those who disagreed with his views lacked strong evidence, referencing studies that weren\u2019t always persuasive. With that being said, this aspect of the course is always an opportunity for intellectual engagement, as you can agree with or challenge his points and ask questions to explore your viewpoints. The freedom to share your opinions and dig deeper into the material is one of the most valuable aspects of the class, allowing you to form your own perspective on the libertarian arguments presented.",

      "Very cool class, would highly recommend. Each week a different guest speaker comes to deliver two lectures on their work. You will likely find some topics more interesting than others, but I thought that was a real strength of the course \u2013\u2013 it provides a nice survey of what current research in biophysics looks like, and for me personally, was a great chance to find what areas excited me most. Final assignment is a good exercise in asking interesting questions \u2013\u2013 did take some effort to do, but I found it rewarding. Good class, recommend it!",
      "For any future students, let me tell you, MCB 294 is just plain disappointing. It is probably the most underwhelming class I\u2019ve had in my whole time at Harvard as a student. On paper, it sounded cool \u2013 each week you get a different professor to introduce their research, but in reality, it was a hot mess from start to finish.First off, the professor barely even showed up. Professor Nancy Kleckner? She was MIA for like 90% of the class. She only popped in for the first day, one random lecture, and then one \u201ccheck\u2013in\u201d session. After that, it was all on the Teaching Fellow (TF)\u2014who honestly wasn\u2019t much help either. She barely tried to connect with us, mostly just sat in the corner on her laptop like she had better things to do. Nobody tried to build any type of community, and it left everyone feeling lost and disconnected. Oh, and the room setup was confusing too. Half of my classmates were stuck sitting on the side against the wall, while the rest of us got to be in the action at a central table. However, this led to my peers that sat on the outside feeling left out of discussions, and a strong sense of disconnect.When it came to assignments, you only had two things all semester: a three\u2013page paper and a 10\u2013minute presentation. However, don\u2019t expect much help on that. The only support we got was a one\u2013on\u2013one Zoom with Nancy to \u201cbrainstorm\u201d ideas for the paper and a group feedback session\u2014but that was not enough. There was no rubric, no clear guidance, nothing. Then, Nancy's feedback? It was mostly negative and confusing, leaving everyone frustrated and feeling like they had no direction. While her comments were valid at times, it just came off extremely condescending, and did not motivate us to do better.Then things just kept getting worse. During one of the feedback sessions, the TF accidentally screen shared an email from Nancy about a student\u2019s final project in front of the whole class, which was straight up embarrassing. But that wasn\u2019t even the worst part. When it came time for the final presentations, Nancy didn\u2019t even bother to show up. For the big event that was supposed to wrap up everything, she straight up ghosted our class due to having a conference abroad. To be honest, most of us wished that Nancy could've either rescheduled for a day that she could attend, or at least chosen to be there remotely, instead of completely leaving us behind. Then, to make matters worse, one of the backup professors who was supposed to give feedback came late. According to my friends in that later section, the professor didn\u2019t even show up for the first hour of the presentations, meaning a bunch of them got no feedback at all. Long story short, this class was a straight\u2013up mess. No structure, no support, and no real engagement from the staff. Yeah, there\u2019s not much work to do each week, but that\u2019s only because the class had no true direction. This experience honestly left me questioning my whole grad school experience, and I\u2019d say avoid this class at all costs. There are way better options out there if you actually want to learn something.",

While the course covers a lot holistically, the narrative that introductory material needs to dismiss or decenter these factors is a dangerous idea to reproduce. Professor LeBeau does not really offer a lot when it comes to discussing these ideas, and discusses them with an elementary effort that seems to rely on the fact that she does not specialize in race, class, or gender studies. Class discussion is profuse, which is nice, but LeBeau does not offer a lot of stimulus and generally just lets students speak without a lot of guidance or stimulus.",

      "You get to do some REALLY cool experiments in this class, some of which are representative of quintessential discoveries from the past century. Regardless of whether or not you\u2019re an experimentalist/going for honors/going to grad school, I would recommend you give this class a shot since being able to perform these experiments is really a special opportunity. One small downside was that the introduction to the experiments given by the lab wiki/manual could do with some updates and improvements, since a lot of time you might have to do a substantial amount of outside reading and research to understand the theory/experimental background. The highlight of this course was the teaching team: Prof Silvera and Yacoby are the best. Prof Yacoby pushes you to deeply understand the relevant physics behind your work, and some of his explanations and lectures in this course have been the most enjoyable and illuminating expositions I\u2019ve ever experienced. Prof Silvera is very sweet and caring, bringing liquid nitrogen ice cream and pie on the last day to share with the students. Joe and Jieping though, are the true stars. Not only are they genuinely some of the kindest and most caring folks I\u2019ve met here, always wearing a smile and brightening the mood at the lab, they\u2019re also so knowledgeable and helpful about all the experiments. I have no clue what we would\u2019ve done without them. Overall, highly recommended!",

We will then delve into modern particle physics and cosmology and how theory and experiment culminated in the \"Standard Model of particle physics\" which physicists use today as well as the current cosmological model based on the Big Bang theory and inflation. We will also move beyond the standard theories into more speculative arenas, including supersymmetry, string theory, and theories of extra dimensions of space, as well as ideas about the nature of dark matter and black holes. We will consider the motivations underlying these theories, their current status, and how we might hope to test some of the underlying ideas in the near future.",

      "QFT under Prof Schwartz is a very time\u2013consuming but incredibly rewarding class. As an undergraduate, I definitely had to spend upwards of 20 hrs/week on this class (as the syllabus warns) \u2013 it is so helpful to read the textbook before lecture, and then the psets themselves are very time\u2013intensive and took me 20 hrs/week. Prof Schwartz's textbook is fantastic and is much clearer than the lectures \u2013 I honestly did not take away much from lecture, since we go so fast that it was hard for me to absorb the content if I was seeing it for the first time and also take notes. However, reading the textbook before and then going to lecture just to internalize the content was helpful.The psets are pretty long and there are some questions that are kind of just mind\u2013numbing soul\u2013crushing algebraic calculations. But I guess that is the nature of the material, and is what you're signing up for in the end. However, this class was extremely rewarding for me \u2013 it was a very nice culmination of all the undergraduate physics classes I had taken before, and I walked away feeling more confident in my abilities as a physicist and understanding of physics in general. As someone who doesn't want to do high energy, not much of the content will be useful for me in the future, but I still think this class was worthwhile since I got exposed to some really cool physics that I otherwise wouldn't have a chance to see.The teaching staff was fantastic and in general very flexible with deadlines, which is greatly appreciated. The 48 hour final was very challenging for me but I think if you take time to really make sure you internalize the concepts and problem\u2013solving approaches that are introduced in the psets, it is doable. I would highly recommend this class, but my only warning is that you really have to commit to taking it if you are an undergrad. This is not a class you can just cruise through and do the bare minimum \u2013 for me, to really understand the content, I did have to put in 20 hours/week like the syllabus says. So if you are willing and able to make that kind of commitment, I would definitely recommend it!",

      "I cannot recommend this class enough! I came into this semester pretty uncertain about whether I wanted to take this class because I was worried it would be too hard (I had just finished 140a). The class was certainly a challenge \u2014 I had to block of quite a bit of time over the weekend to do the weekly readings and at times it felt like I was reading at a snails pace \u2014 but overall it was extremely doable. The teaching staff provides so much support to make it possible. There are vocab lists every week with key vocabulary that helps a lot for the readings. Because the texts are a bit challenging your Chinese improves quite noticeably over the course of the class which is great. You also have a one on one meeting with the TFs every week to answer questions, discuss the texts, and get feedback on your paper. The paper is super scaffolded because you only have to turn in a short chunk of it every other week. I will flag that you have to come up with your paper topic extremely early in the semesters, though, so I would start thinking about that right away. The one caveat I will say for this class is that there are *a lot* of assignments and deadlines. But the grading is extremely generous and there's extra credit, so while you have a fair bit to do every week grades are not a concern.Ultimately, it was extremely rewarding to feel that years of studying Chinese has paid off to the point where instead of learning to read in Chinese I am now reading to learn. The stories are so delightful and Professor Wang\u2019s lectures are absolutely phenomenal, providing historical context and analysis of the texts. I learned so much about Chinese history and culture through this class. Please take this class!!!",

      "OMG I LOVED THIS CLASS. Quantum mechanics is such a cool topic and I'm so glad I decided to skip 15c and take it. I was worried because Cora tells everyone in the beginning \"I'm gonna assume you all took 15b and 15c\" but to be honest, you're totally fine without 15c. Besides, quantum teaches you all the stuff that's actually relevant moving on from 15c without you having to go through the 15c growing pains. It's awesome because taking 143a will open a lot of gates for you: you have more options for physics courses or research labs to join. It's a great pill to swallow. I personally am not a fan of the psets. They felt very computational to the point that I was questioning if I'm taking QM or Math 1a. It's literally pages and pages of stupid Gaussian integrals where you have to integrate by parts like 3 times for one integral. And there's like at least 12 integrals to evaluate on most of the early psets. I think I would've done better if the psets were conceptually challenging and tested my understanding of the material instead of my ability to compute integrals. But that's more of a problem with the book that the problems are sourced from, I suppose. Speaking of the book, Griffith's book is great (a pretty standard textbook) and it was pretty clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend reading the book because it's very easy to follow along the derivations, get lost in the math, and forget about what you're doing at a conceptual level. In terms of pre\u2013reqs, DEFINITELY TAKE LINEAR ALGEBRA BEFORE. You absolutely MUST understand how to diagonalize matrices, the concept behind eigenvalues, vector spaces, etc. Knowing Fourier Analysis helps too. I found my knowledge from 21b transferred beautifully. Thinking of constructing eigenbases, understanding the spectral theorem, etc can help you establish a stronger understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Of course if you want an even more rigorous introduction to QM you could take 251. But the point of this course is to provide you the basic tools to start doing real physics. There are likely freshman who want to skip 15b, 15c and take this course. I think you could totally do that as long as you have taken 21b/22a. If you've taken Physics 19, you'll find that some things are familiar. If you have zero experience with linear algebra, definitely do not take it. It's impossible to take this course without linear algebra\u2013\u2013 you would either have to crash course it or you would be memorizing formulas without really understanding.I loved this course so much and it has definitely made me hungry to learn more physics!!",
      "READ THE TEXTBOOK! And if its been a while since you've taken Linear Algebra, then refer to the textbook's appendix, which makes for a very helpful refresher on the necessary concepts. I simply did not find the lectures sufficient to learn the material, and, in all honesty, I learned most of the material from reading.For the engineers out there thinking that it would be cool and quirky to study quantum mechanics, be very wary of the work that it takes. It is just as difficult as its reputation purports and in the end, you will end up with very niche knowledge about a topic that will have almost no practical application. That said, if quantum subfields of electronics or particle accelerators are your thing, then go for it, but as a mechanical engineer, I unfortunately never see myself using this information except for the intuition it gave me for real\u2013world applications of linear algebra.",

Weekly discussions will center on close readings of selected love poems and versified narrratives from a variety of literary traditions, including: Proven\u00e7al troubadour lyric; French chansons, the Germanic Minnesang and the Galician-Portuguese cantigas (the question of amour courtois); Ibero-Romance and colloquial Arabic jarchas; the Italian dolce stil novo; the Petrarchan sonnet and its early modern heirs in Portugal, England and Spain; Arabo-Andalusian and Hispano-Jewish qa\u1e63\u0101\u2019id and muwashsha\u1e25\u0101t, medieval Latin love lyric; Persian Sufi and Christian mystical love poetry; Dante\u2019s Vita nuova; and selections from two other erotological classics in narrative verse, Libro de buen amor and Roman de la Rose. Discussions will be framed by an overview of both premodern discussions on love \u2013 how love is conceptualized at the intersection of philosophy, theology and medicine by Jewish, Christian and Muslim thinkers\u2013 and contemporary scholarly debates on the origins and development of medieval love literature.",

I am a person who learns a lot more when I am actively engaged, and I would say I learned so much more during the trip than what I learned in lecture. Even though Stein is knowledgable about the subject, his presentation and delivery of lecture materials leave much more to be desired. He has an extremely dry teaching style. He is very monotonous and that's because he is mostly reading off of his incredibly text dense slides. These slides are useful and are really big resources, but it is not good for presentation. If you want a class that will keep you engaged, this is not the one. If you want to learn more about minerals and petrology, I would recommend other EPS classes. Psets are tedious with excel but not difficult. They feel unrelated to lecture material, but they help us learn skills/calculations that may be useful in practice.

It's a great mix between watching/discussing films, learning technical skills, and creating your own short films. You are encouraged to take creative risks and give/receive honest feedback on your projects.If you are a creative thinker, are openminded to feedback, and can figure things out via google / youtube / chatGPT, and are willing to put in the work, you'll do well.

      "AP50a vs PS 2 is definitely one of the biggest fights and arguments you will see within the STEM and pre\u2013med community. From someone that took AP50a and will be continuing with AP50b, here are my honest thoughts about the course. As many suggest from previous Q\u2013Reports, AP50a is a course where you will learn literally NOTHING, but walk away with an A as long as you put in the time and effort (although be forewarned, that time is going to be A LOT).For context, the structure of the class includes a LOT of weekly assignments, as listed below:\u2022 Sunday by 11:59 PM \u2013 Reading Assessment: you are expected to read about 20\u201330 pages in the textbook and leave about 10\u201315 comments to \u2018stimulate conversation\u2019 with your peers\u2022 Sunday by 11:59 PM \u2013 Readiness Assurance (Individual): you complete around 10\u201320 practice questions individually based on the topics you learned from reading\u2022 Tuesday by 9 AM \u2013 Tutorial (Individual): you complete an application\u2013based assignment on Desmos consisting of about 20\u201330 slides on the weekly topics you learned from reading\u2022 Tuesday IN CLASS \u2013 Tutorial (Team): you review over the Desmos tutorial assignment with your team and complete check\u2013ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers \u2013 ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED\u2022 Tuesday by 6 PM \u2013 Readiness Assurance (Team Round): you re\u2013visit the Readiness Assurance from Sunday with your team and re\u2013submit what you think is correct \u2013 ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED\u2022 Thursday by 9 AM \u2013 Challenge (Individual): you complete a 3 question problem set individually before class and submit to Gradescope\u2022 Thursday IN CLASS \u2013 Challenge (Team): you review over your challenge with your team and complete check\u2013ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers \u2013 ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED\u2022 Thursday IN CLASS \u2013 Skill Session: you take your newly learned concepts from the week and put it into practice by completing different activities + a short Canvas quiz \u2013 ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADEDAs you can see, there are a minimum of at least EIGHT weekly assignments you will have to do in AP50, which combined with the in\u2013class component, means that you are spending around 15 hours/week MINIMUM to complete your objectives. The plus side to this is that AP50a contains NO EXAMS and also only grades your TEAM sessions, which means that only your CORRECTED copy of the Challenge + Tutorial are counted. However, this makes for a very unintuitive and time consuming way of learning, as you have no lectures and only learn based off of a short textbook reading and some random assignments. The truth about AP50a is, if you do all of the tasks outlined above, you are GUARANTEED an A. They do not lie or trick students, and are very straight forward with the requirements. However, just be warned that you MUST stay on track and complete EVERYTHING on time, as even missing ONE assignment or having ONE dissatisfactory grade will automatically bump you down a letter grade. As a result, AP50a is only a good fit for those that are able to stay on top of their work.From a classroom dynamics perspective, AP50 is very interesting. In terms of the teaching team, some of the TFs do not seem adequately prepared and often make odd mistakes. Every Tuesday and Thursday, students do \u201ccheck in sessions\u201d with the TF where they present their group\u2019s final answers to the Tutorial and/or Challenge and get feedback. However, there have been multiple instances of TFs either being extremely rude and unhelpful, or straight up providing inaccurate and wrong information. This also extends to grading, where they have accidentally docked students for things they cannot even identify later on when asked. This even extends into the actual structure of the class, as there have been multiple instances where there are issues with the Canvas page or associated assignments (as with a huge banner across one of the Tutorials on Demos telling the teaching team to remove a section of the assignment, even though it was still there and had already been published). Unfortunately, this made the class seem very poorly unorganized and like an afterthought in some regards.Now that we\u2019re a semester in, to be honest, I do not think I have learned much from AP50a. Although the course boasts this reputation and *big idea* of using a different teaching approach that is meant to enable students to learn by DOING, the course falls short of this in many ways. At the end of the day, you will basically turn into an automated machine each week with completing each of the assignments, without ever really taking the material in and LEARNING. However, as mentioned above, you will be guaranteed an A as long as you can keep up.With all of this in mind, I think that AP50a is a good course if you are solely looking for a good grade, as you WILL earn an A as long as you do everything. However, do not enter with the expectation to truly learn, and be ready to spend countless moments of the semester focused on the next, upcoming assignment for AP50a to ensure you keep that A.",
      "Be very careful with this class. The idea of having no exams, and just \"having to complete my work\" sounded amazing. What I didn't know was how incredibly laborious and PAINFUL that work was. The structure of the course is so beyond convoluted and confusing, there is SO much work to do and so many deadlines throughout the week, the TFs are incredibly picky with the wording you use and the way you say things, and the whole class you feel like you're scrambling to finish. When I signed up, I read the Q reports and thought \"ok well how bad can it actually really be?\" \u2013 the answer was BAD.",

      "You have to take it if you're a HS concentrator lol. But anyways, I really liked it, because it's pretty much a whole semester just to write one paper, and you meet for class once a week just to check in on how you're doing and get some tips on how to do your paper better. I really liked the freedom and flexibility of this style of course. Also, Simon was such a good instructor and always gave such helpful and more importantly, specifically ACTIONABLE feedback on papers so that you'd know exactly what you have to do to get an A. Also, bc the whole semester is just writing a paper (you don't rly start till after the 5th or 6th week of the course, bc the first part of the course is kinda a super short repeat of HS 97), you should start as early as possible in writing and get as much done as you can earlier on in the process (e.g., the writing chunks often have a page minimum of 4\u20135 pages, but if you happen to have more time that week, you should do way more), bc then there will be more instances where your instructor can give you more specific feedback so that you can guarantee an A. And also, if you do it early enough, it is definitely possible to be basically done the paper by the end of thanksgiving break (if you're taking it in the fall).",
      "This is a somewhat frustrating course. The ultimate goal is completing a 25 page paper, however you won't start working on it until week 6 or so. This course feels like a repeat of the sophomore tutorial, except this time you submit a final paper.",

The presentations and compositions are also super reasonable, and honestly fun especially if you do the presentation in a group.

In the recent history of Latin America, there are multiple instances where aesthetics and politics have intertwined in order to create and find new meanings for the issues plaguing the region. If a citizen participates in both the action of being governed and the action of governing, there is no doubt that aesthetics, understood as the formal exploration of the distribution of the sensible, as Ranci\u00e8re would say, is a productive space for analysis to understand Latin American intellectual and political traditions.In this course, we will panoramically explore the relationship between aesthetics and politics throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries in Latin America. By studying cinema, literature, art, music, and more, the objective is to offer students an approach to how art and culture bear witness, often in a more visceral and affective way than is possible from a purely historiographical or sociological approach, to what politics cannot resolve. We will analyze and discuss Latin American productions based on key aesthetic concepts (manifesto, declamation, performance, documentary, etc.), in order to trace and outline the anxieties plaguing both art and contemporary Latin American criticism.",

      "This class is one of my favorites ever at Harvard! Professor Vela Martinez and TF Andrea made this course so great. We had very insightful discussions studying what defines \"Latin America\" and the politics and anxieties that accompany this ambiguous definition. These questions are extremely difficult to answer, but they were able to guide our discussions and make them productive by doing close reading and analyzing a variety of works, including novels, short stories, poetry, movies, etc. I loved the course curriculum and everything we read and studied allowed me to broaden my view of Latin America and post\u2013colonial anxieties while improving my close reading and analysis skills. I felt very safe to speak my opinions in class as the environment was very conducive to the sharing of ideas. I think that the rubrics were very fair and clearly defined expectations for our work.

      "Wow, this course was a lot. Reading the Q guide from previous years, I took this class expecting to improve my spanish in a small\u2013class setting, in a relatively low stress way. I came in having some spanish background from high school, but having forgotten a lot of it. While the class was very small (6 students including me), it turned out to be pretty stressful and a lot of work. THIS CLASS IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTOR DEPENDENT!!! Majo, the instructor this year, was very energetic and excited to teach, which made the class fun, especially at 9 am. But she was definitely strict in certain ways, much more than last year's instructor. First, we were only allowed 3 absences, which is very few for a 9 am that meets every day (over 60 times total throughout the semester).  These absenses included religious and medical absences, which was a bit crazy. Also be prepared for the commitment this class takes ... there are nightly Canvas modules, 22 graded homeworks, 5 written exams, 5 class presentations, 5 reports to accompany the presentations, 3 conversations you need to have with native speakers with follow up written reports, all on top of showing up  every morning and actually putting in the time outside of class to learn the material. While I enjoyed the class at times, especially toward the beginning of the semester, the sheer number of assignments became overbearing and frustrating by about the half\u2013way point. I often felt like I was doing busywork that wasn't actually improving my spanish. The best assignments/classes/activities were the ones where we could talk to native speakers and classmates about everyday things because that is most realistic if traveling to a spanish speaking country, but these activities were few and far between the long writing assignments and sometimes long homeworks.  Despite it being a lot of work, I am definitely coming out of this class better at speaking spanish and writing spanish. I am very appreciative of this.To conclude, if you put in the work in this class, everything will work out just fine (you will learn a lot and do well), but make sure you have the time before committing to taking it. It definitely feels like an 8 credit class.",

      "Complexity has set the bar for humanities at Harvard incredibly high. This is the most transformative and enlightening academic experience I have ever had, and I doubt that it can be surpassed (though I wholeheartedly hope that it will). I cannot recommend this class enough. I mean it. I do not know how to convey just how much I loved this course. I cannot be more grateful to have ended up in this class \u2013 it's the best thing that has happened to me academically and I will do my best to convey why it is such a special course.Complexity realizes the full potential of what a First Year Seminar can be. A First\u2013Year Seminar is a pass/fail course, which means that you should treat the course as if the grade was completely irrelevant. For some, it may mean that you can put in a minimal amount of work to get by. If this is what you expect, you should consider another course. Not having a lettered grading scale offers the opportunity for you to learn for the sake of learning: there is no upper limit to how much work you can put into this course. There is no assurance of \"having done enough\" that an \"A\" offers. This is a class where how much you put in is how much you get out of it. I mean this in the best sense possible \u2013 as long as you are willing to put in the work, there is simply no limit to the amount of intellectual gratification you can get out of this course. That's why I appreciated this course so much. I spent an average of ten hours per week on this course; it is my biggest time commitment of the term. I can say that every single ounce of effort I put into it was worth it. My point is that you should take this course if and only if: 1) you are passionate about the content, 2) you are willing to learn for the sake of learning, and 3) you are willing to put a lot of work into it because you enjoy learning.What makes Professor Fisher and Complexity phenomenal is his willingness to treat you as an intellectual equal and his care. From the very first week of class, the guiding questions were complex and they never stopped being complex. One can build a course based on the questions listed in each week's handout alone. Professor Fisher does not dumb down the content so that you can understand; he presents Hamlet and Ulysses in their full complexity and thereby illustrates their greatness and their full interpretative potential. Each weekly lecture was the highlight of my week. Professor Fisher cares a lot about the content, and he gets you to care, too. I would always walk away feeling ineffably inspired, even if I had spent the night before writing my response paper until 5 AM. The lectures were so engaging and for the lack of a better term, so, so, so intellectually stimulating. It is truly a privilege to be able to take this course, and knowing that this course has ended makes me feel very sad.Professor Fisher also provides very helpful feedback on your weekly response papers. His detailed annotation of my weekly response papers motivated me to push myself to write better and gave me the critical perspective I needed to do so. That alone makes taking the course worth it. Furthermore, I have also gained so many invaluable insights into literature and into what I want to do with my undergraduate years from talking to him during his office hours. Again, I cannot overstate my appreciation.As a cherry on top, you will also be reading Hamlet and Ulysses, some of the greatest works of art ever created. I had no idea what Ulysses was before I started and I will never regret reading it. But if I hadn't read it with the guidance of this course, I do not think I would have been able to get nearly as much out of it as I did; Ulysses is, as Professor Fisher says, a scholarly book that is best read in an academic setting. If anything I said resonates with what you want academically, you should take this class.",

For those completely new to ML, you'll walk away with a pretty strong grasp of PyTorch and the resources and skills to start building and training your own models. For those interested in NLP, you'll touch on every single part of the language model pipeline and walk away implementing your very own sequence to sequence model from scratch. Additionally, you'll learn a lot about formal language theory. While this language is less broadly applicable to ML, it is still interesting stuff especially if you're into linguistics at all. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. If you're willing to spend the time and work past this courses flaws, you'll find this class really is wonderful.

      "First, I want to address, acknowledge, and preface this overview with a few points before my larger feedback. My opinion on this class has absolutely nothing to do with the scholarly capacity and capabilities of Professor Waters and Skocpol. Both are incredible academics and have much to contribute to academia. Also, my TF, Meylin Hauman, was truly unbelievable, and the review below is no reflection of her abilities to effectively teach. She was both kind and accommodating, passionate about her specialties and the course material writ large. I truly wish her the best in her future endeavors in research and teaching.Okay, now for an overview of my points below. My overarching issue with the course is the vast material it tries to cover, the sheer content, and how some of the information presented to us was not done with an underlying thesis or takeaway. I will present my opinions in bullet\u2013point format, addressing both information for prospective students and recommendations for how I would\u2019ve better walked away from the class.\u2013 The number of readings: I know they\u2019ve already mentioned to us that they tried to cut it down, but still, it is a lot. Again, I am totally okay with a lot of reading (I\u2019m a social studies concentrator). But this is a Gen Ed and supposed to be, to some degree, at an introductory level. By providing the amount of readings and their length each week (4\u20136, with many over 20 pages), it was an information overload. It was width, not depth. I only memorized readings for the exams, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll forget most by this time next year. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: keep it to 2 a week or 1 book for two weeks. Each week, the readings could include a twenty\u2013 to thirty\u2013page academic paper or journal article followed by a 5\u201310\u2013page journalistic or media article that offers a countering perspective, nuance, or another angle. This would allow students to really be able to read the material better, more effectively use them on the exams, and actually get into the depth of their corresponding and ongoing conversations in academia. Moreover, the arguments raised could more effectively be incorporated into the lectures. I believe that you can still teach the basics of American society and public policy by going through and weighing arguments and showing how they build them with first principles. And if you\u2019re concerned about students not doing the readings, add a discussion post component that is 100\u2013250 words a week.\u2013 Reduce the material covered in lectures: At times, it felt like I was in a high school class being provided a swarm of information on the screen, only for most of it not to be important. For example, when giving context to contemporary issues (while some of the historical information is super interesting), it is overwhelming. Provide just a slide that goes over previous periods and what defined them. I don\u2019t believe there is a need to go over specific laws or specific names of phenomena if you\u2019re not going to test students on it. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: just cut the excess out of lectures or streamline the information that can be streamlined, incorporate and emphasize the most important \u201cbumper\u2013stickers\u201d of the lesson. Have specific, clear, and detailed learning objectives so that students know exactly what to note down, pay attention to, and, most importantly, study for. For example, \u201ccauses of inequality\u201d is not a specific enough learning objective; listing out instead \u201ctaxation as a contribution to inequality\u201d or things to that effect. This would help students have a better understanding of what they need to learn (and they will then be able to study and reinforce it, as opposed to searching for it and guessing this is the correct thing they are supposed to be studying and coming to find out it is not even remotely mentioned on an exam).\u2013 The ID terms were not clearly identified: A key component of how students are evaluated in this course is their ability to write down and memorize key concepts or terms, like laws or sociological principles. However, students were not provided with a list or sort of reference other than simply materials presented in the lectures. This goes back to point (2): how can a student effectively study and learn if they do not know exactly the basic concepts they are going to be tested on? Put simply, the exam is a game of memorization and anticipated questions, and would it not make the most sense to provide a basic pool of terms and concepts that could be selected? Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: give a list of all the IDs that will be covered in each unit. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to only give the ones out that you would put on the exam, but rather all potential ones. This allows students to both better prepare for the actual exam and also go over and learn material that the professors still think is important for them to walk away with. This would make the objectives and results of the course abundantly clear: what I\u2019m supposed to know and be able to talk about professionally, academically, or in my future research.\u2013 No clear academic argument or interpretation: I felt as though the lectures were just a list of random facts at times. While there is most certainly a place for just the brass facts, I think each lecture lacked a clear thesis or walkaway. I would have appreciated it if the professors made an academic argument while providing essential information. In this process, they can and should engage and explain other perspectives, but I take a class to get two things: (a) new information and (b) a scholar's interpretation of that information. Now, I can still come to my own conclusions, but at least I am aware of how academics in the field are thinking about the topic and understand the evidence or information they\u2019re using to come to these conclusions. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: think about the overarching argument I am giving in the lecture, how I can present the basic concepts, information, or background information essential to understanding the debate, and highlight other scholars' opinions and analysis.Overall, while this course benefits from exceptional instructors, passionate teaching, and a wealth of valuable content, its effectiveness is hindered by an overwhelming breadth of material, unclear learning objectives, and a lack of cohesive academic arguments. By streamlining the readings, focusing lectures on key takeaways, providing clear ID terms, and emphasizing overarching theses, the course could better balance depth with accessibility. These adjustments would not only improve the student experience but also ensure that the knowledge gained is more impactful, memorable, and relevant for future academic or professional pursuits.",
      "do NOT take the course the grading is so arbitrary it's also basically just an echo chamber of how liberal you can be. there are also 0 lecture recordings really inaccessible and overall not a pleasant experience. very little justification on grading too it's just \"i think you deserve this grade\" and you can't ask why the TFs and teaching staff cannot answer how points were given out.",

We will discover that as the novelistic treatment of consciousness changes, so the idea of what a mind (or a self) is, also changes: the form (the means of representation) modifies the content (what is represented). What might seem at first like a fairly small thing \u2013 a question of novelistic technique \u2013 will turn out to have massive and far-reaching consequences for our sense of self.

      "I highly recommend this class! The texts don't need any introduction, they truly are *transformative*, and Professor Wood is incredibly smart and knowledgeable (as are the people taking the class with you). Reading these incredible books alongside others and with such insightful guidance was exactly the kind of experience I hoped for when coming to Harvard. However, I found the format of the course a bit challenging\u2014it's a mix between a lecture and a seminar, which didn\u2019t really work for me. For a seminar, the class size was quite large, so contributing often felt intimidating\u2014like giving a speech with 20 people around the table. I would have preferred a more traditional lecture format or a smaller seminar setting. Additionally, while it was wonderful to hear everyone\u2019s scattered thoughts, the discussions tended to feel unstructured. If you\u2019re hoping for a focused exploration of consciousness or a clear thematic thread, you might find it harder to extract cohesive ideas, as our discussions often revolved around whatever we found interesting in the books. Additionally, the grading relies on two essays without rubrics or structured prompts\u2014you have the freedom to write on any topic, but this can feel risky if you\u2019re concerned about your GPA. Despite these structural challenges, I am so glad I took this class.

It is harder than 120, and slightly more time consuming, but it's a lot more interesting and advanced (in my opinion), and will likely prepare you better for 124 if you haven't taken it already. Furthermore, a lot of the theory that you learn is pretty applicable to industry CS, and is especially helpful for things such as time and space complexity. The course also has a ton of great resources, with organized lectures and lecture notes, wonderful sections which recap the topics learned during the week, and a very good textbook which clarifies most of the lecture material. If you attend/watch lectures, go to section, and read the textbook, you'll do more than fine in the class. By just doing those three things, I was very prepared for both midterms, and didn't have to do much studying outside of making a notes sheet. The TFs are all great, and they are super fair graders. The psets took around 8 hours per pset, but I felt that most of the problems were doable without going to office hours, but even when I had to, they were never very busy.

I recommend you take this toward the end of your AM degree \u2013\u2013 I took as a senior \u2013\u2013 because it lets you become acquainted in depth with the subjects and techniques in other classes (ie stat, optimization, coding, etc) before being asked to tackle them and apply them for yourself in this class. The projects are super interesting and very free form \u2013 you can work on what you are interested in (you will know better what interests you as a senior than as a freshman!). The grading does not seem excessively punishing at all, the Prof is super passionate for the subject and just wants to see you give it a good go. The first p set is very challenging and daunting, but dont be afraid \u2013 p sets are not weekly, there are only four total, and they get easier. Overall would strongly recommend the class even outside of its implications for the AM degree, modeling is a fantastic skillset and is taught passionately and not arduously here.",

The primary focus of the course is on the modern trends that are shaping the data management industry right now: column-store and hybrid systems, shared nothing architectures, cache conscious algorithms, hardware/software co-design, main-memory systems, adaptive indexing, stream processing, scientific data management, and key-value stores. We also study the history of data systems, traditional and seminal concepts and ideas such as the relational model, row-store database systems, optimization, indexing, concurrency control, recovery and SQL. In this way, we discuss both how and why data systems evolved over the years, as well as how these concepts apply today and how data systems might evolve in the future. We focus on understanding concepts and trends rather than specific techniques that will soon be outdated - as such the class relies largely on recent research material and on a semi-flipped class model with a lot of hands-on interaction in each class.",

This puts it easily in first place followed by CS61, CS124, and Stat 111 at 193, 180, 172 hours total. In all cases, these times including _everything_ done for the class. Suffice it to say, this class has a HEAVY workload. If I had attempted more of the extra credit and interesting add\u2013ons to the project, I would have easily been able to put in 300+ hours into this class. So, the usual warnings of time management apply here. You might notice that I put in almost no time in the first third of the course. This was, in my opinion, a massive mistake.In the beginning, you will start with a handout code of a couple hundred lines. However, by the end, you will end up writing 6000+ lines of code. In my case, I ended up writing 9979 lines of .c and .h code. Of course there are empty and comment lines included in that, but you see my point. As such, code organization will be very important. For example, your project will need code to parse and execute various database operators. How will you do this? Perhaps consider putting each operator into its own file such as parse_select.c and execute_select.c as an example. Similarly, there will need to be thought put into the load and print commands whose execution will require logic dissimilar than the other operators. How will you deal with cases where you need to find a specific result column from its handle? How about when you need to find a database column from its full name? how about finding the specific entry in the client context for a relevant search? How will you handle database persistance? Where will code for btree and sorted index creation go? In the file with execute_create? maybe a separate create_index.c file? Where will the functions doing the search within the indices go? There is just simply a lot of code to be written. Think about semantic ways of separating your code into different files. If not, your files such as db_manager, parse and execute will baloon to thousands of lines. If using vscode, things like ctrl shift o, ctrl p, and various vim\u2013esque keyboard shortcuts will be increase your productivity. The lectures were very dissimilar to other lecture\u2013style CS classes I took. I was with a great cohort of students and we tried our best to ask so so many questions. We questioned everything and Stratos was great and he encouraged us in that. I think this class wins the award for the most knowledge learnt through slides per word on the slides :D To the point and keeps the focus on the conversation we are having with Stratos. CS165 has the most generous course policies of any course. I want to thus go into a tangent on the many many generosities shown by the class. Both exams are take\u2013home and start at 9AM and last until 12pm the next day. It is open book, open computer, open internet, AND, most importantly, open people! You are able to talk through the problems with others taking the class! Of course your writeup needs to be done separately, but this is the kind of confidence they have in their problems and in their teaching philosophy. I learned so much from the back\u2013and\u2013forth discussions we had when trying to come up with the best algorithm for a task. How is it that the Midterm _taught_ me something? Incredible. The class has almost no deadlines. There is a midway check\u2013in mid october by which you need to pass the first 3 of the 59 tests. This is to give you a sense of the gigantic scope of this project compared to any other class you have ever taken. Beyond that, there is only one deadline, the final one. Essentially, the course trusts you completely and leaves almost everything to you. You make any kind of design decisions. The midterms were fine. There is extra credit galore in each midterm and your first midterm doesn't count if you do better on your second. Nothing to worry about. ezpz. I highly suggest using Ubuntu/Linux for developing this project. You will be directly developing in the OS that your testing server will use. You will also be able to compile and run natively without worrying about cstdlib functions not being present on mac or windows. Please god please don't use windows.  `gdb` is essential for this project. Specifically, learn how to create a .gdbinit file and create various layouts which will come in handy. A particularly useful layout for me was `tui new\u2013layout <layout_name> {\u2013horizontal src 3} 2 cmd 1`. You can switch to this layout using `layout <layout_name>`. Learn also how to use vgdb to use gdb together with valgrind for a powerful duo. I heavily suggest using tmux as a terminal multiplexer. Learning it and setting it up as I like is has been an absolute game changer. For example, I didn't do this myself and it cost me dear time at the end: create a test execution script that can start the server and client processes as well as can input specific tests into the client. Use the test generation scripts to create tests of different magnitudes. You should at least create the 10million row version of the tests. Then, develop your project only using the larger tests. I personally always used a 1million row dataset and its tests. It served me very well. 10 million is for the stress tests. For example, did you know that there is a max limit size of a stack allocated array? This means any stack allocated array should make sure it doesn't go past that size. This is very niche: the course uses C99 but C99 does not have a address aligned malloc function. HOWEVER, you can create one yourself if you would like. The way you do this can be found on the internet, but what this allowes you to do is to assume almost every memory region you allocated is cache/page aligned. How about that :DSome Areas that the course could improve upon: 1\u2013 The CS165 language needs to be updated. For example, there are tests that require single\u2013threaded execution. Thus, there is a single_core() and single_core_execute() command that essentially enable and disable multicode performance. Very easy to implement, however, it must be included in the language regardless. 2\u2013 Certain things about the project need to be clarified. For example, it is possible for certain tests to create an internal variable, say s1, and then overwrite it with a new result also named s1. However, at least from my look at the project, there is no text on whether this is allowed. 3\u2013 The create column command specification is `create(col,<col_name>,<tbl_var>)` however, the examples shown just below it show examples such as `create(col,\"project\",awesomebase.grades,unsorted)`. However, this `unsorted` argument is not allowed given the language. These kinds of inconsistencies need to be resolved and not left to be clarified every year using Ed. 4\u2013 Many students including me experience issues with permissions and with the docker container running as root. This is extremely unnecessary and dangerous I believe. If the docker container has any issues, it will execute with root access. My docker container should not be able to nuke my computer :D I mean this is an exageration, but there is no reason to not have a basic user such as `cs165\u2013student`. This would remove a lot of issues with root permissions. For example, after every time I used run_mile with the make file, it compiles the project with the docker root user. Thus, I need to then run a `sudo` make clean instead of just being to use my normal user. I needed to use sudo so much and I find that this is not good practice and makes it so unnecessary. I had input mu 25 char password every time I needed to do this. I seriously considered reducing my computer's password length or removing it entirely to stop password authentication every single time I needed to compile my code after a run_mile. 5\u2013 Some of the section recordings are extremely old and the audio and video quality is really showing its age. I would humbly that the class invest some TF time to rerecord these videos with hopefully better production. 6\u2013 Certain things mentioned in the milestone requirements turned out to be optional and worth extra credit point. The course needs to clarify what counts as a minimum and what not. For example, I later in the course learned that there would be no inserts done after index creation. This meant that I could make many assumptions about my structure. This lead me to design a \u2013I think\u2013 novel way to store the btree in memory without needing a reference to each node's start address. I literally halved my btree size and made it perform much better in terms of cache locality. Final thoughts:There is so much to say about this class, but just know that this class really cares about your success. There were office hours and help available almost every single day. What can I say, I feel that I didn't make the most of this class and I could have done so much more for this class. I am definitely going to implement the project in Rust at some point:D I wish you luck. If class difficulty is not an immediate no for you, then class will deliver. Take the plunge and learn how one can learn so much in just a semester. Like, the largest project I had worked on before this has 2800 lines of python code. Of course, c gets way less done in the same number of lines, but still, this was a big personal achievement for me to have finished this. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world...",

      "*** FROM A EC1011A and STAT 110 student *** I took both Ec1011a and Stat110 at the same time \u2014 sophomore fall \u2014 and want to first say that it is totally doable (coming from someone who got a B+ in Math 21a). But boy was I wrong about the relative difficulty. I thought that Ec1011 would be mind\u2013boggling hard and Stat110 would be a walk in the park but I could not be more wrong. I thought that Stat110 was a much harder course than Ec1011 for a couple of reasons: (1) Stat has a wide distribution of student abilities so some people get 95 or 100s on the tests, while others get 40s and this means it is much harder to get a good grade as you need to compete relatively against some strong classmates. However in Ec1011, everyone, no matter how much of a math genius they are, does poorly on the test (around a 50 with a tight SD) so if you are just average like me, you won\u2019t suffer under the intelligence of your smarter peers. (2) Ec1011 is just multivariable calculus and taking derivatives which is much more algorithmic (and you have practice in HS), so the math can be messy but it is not extraordinarily difficult. Also the economic logic taught in the course is very self\u2013intuitive, so you can generally know a sensible answer to the question.  However with Stat, it is much more about logical, creative problem solving akin to competition math problems which was harder for me (and many others) as you\u2019re not taught in high school how to solve math problems creatively and find a neat trick that makes the problem a lot easier. I found that Ec was more manageable as everyone is similarly lost together in lecture and the class, while in Stat everyone is expected to understand the material, so if you take both classes at the same time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPENDING MORE TIME ON STAT \u2014 your grade in Econ will only improve by so much and you can take the time to study the material around the midterm and final when Aakaash\u2019s review sections give you a good sense of what will be on the test. Spend the much more important weekly time on getting started on the Stat psets early and building your problem solving skills there. EC1011a vs. Ec1010a For those on the fence, I would highly recommend taking Ec1011a over 1010. (1) In 1011, a majority of the students get an A\u2013 or above as the curve is now more lenient than it used to be (coming from Prof. Glaeser himself) as it needs to more closely match the 1010 grade distribution. I think college is about taking classes that will challenge you and where you will learn a lot (1011), rather than taking a sleepy class where you can coast by and not get the full Harvard experience (1010), so I implore you to ponder about whether you want to make your college experience rewarding and intellectually stimulating or coast by in boredom/ambivalence and wonder why you spend so much money to take boring classes.  (2) The material and skills you learn in 1011 are MUCH MORE satisfying than in 1010. In 1011, you understand and appreciate the importance of modeling in economics and it introduces key concepts like insurance, moral hazard, intertemporal consumption, and monopolies in a much more interesting manner. (3) Professor Glaeser is an incredibly accomplished professor, and despite the fact that he lectures at an incredibly fast pace and takes partials at the speed of light, it felt like taking use of Harvard\u2019s resources to hear from a potential future Nobel laureate. His theory on spatial equilibrium and special topics on the economics of crime, hatred and cities are eye\u2013opening and reveal why microeconomics is such an interesting topic and the variety of ways it can be applied. (4) The first couple weeks of 1011 are designed to scare people off and they are actually the toughest in the course (it gets easier from there). The math before the midterm is really messy and scary, but after the midterm the topics become more interesting, the math is simpler and people are just tired of doing crazy math, so it gets easier from there. If you can survive the early rough patches, you will be in for a great course. Tips to succeed in the course 1. Read/Gloss over ALL the lecture slides before Ed\u2019s lectures. He speeds through material at a speed of light in lecture and even the most smart math people I know couldn\u2019t keep up pace sometimes with how fast he took derivatives. Reading through the lecture slides in advance to understand how he set up a model or does the math will be great so that in class you can just focus on understanding the economic intuition that is much more valuable to grasp in this course. 2. Go to office hours to do psets. The psets (at least in the beginning) are mathematically intense so showing up to office hours and doing them under the guidance of the CA are useful so you aren\u2019t led astray. Also the wording can be confusing and vague so great to get their advice about what the question is aksing you to solve. 3. Psets are graded on completion \u2014 if you are hacking away at math and can\u2019t quite get the right answer just move on. As long as you do/attempt 75% of the pset and spend a good 5 hours, you will come away with full marks so don\u2019t stress4. Attend Aakaash\u2019s review section. These are incredible useful not only when it comes to studying for the midterm/finals, but also for reviewing the weekly lecture material as he draws on it for TFUs and questions on the exams. 5. Understand that you will only understand 50% of Ed\u2019s lectures. He breezes by lecture content as he is very smart and there is a ton of material packed in, so know that you are not alone in barely being able to follow with his lectures 6. Go into the lecture with a goal of understanding the intuition and not the math. The intuition is very important in this course \u2014 that\u2019s what the tests generally test you on, and the math can be secondary to that. No one will really understand the math on your first go, but you always have the time to review the slides and ask the course staff later about math questions. But Ed doesn\u2019t record lecture and can breeze through the logic of the all\u2013important economic intuition so focus on that.",

      "Yes, it's organic chemistry. Yes, it's hard.  BUT it is doable! You just have to give it your best shot and put the work in.  Be prepared to make it your top priority. I took this class with Neuro 80, which I found to not be too difficult.The teaching staff is great and very accessible. In other classes like LPSA and PS11 I didn't really work with or get to know the teaching team. However, it was a huge advantage in this class to get help from the team. Go to the instructor helproom!! It's super helpful and Emma helps a lot with coming up with strategies to solve problems.  Sirinya is amazing and is very accessible outside of class, too. Even for most of the people that were really struggling in the class,  everyone loves Sirinya.Pros:\u2013 A score of 75/100 or higher on psets is considered a 100 (you also get one pset drop)\u2013 There are plenty of resources to use, including help rooms, psets, weekly module packets\u2013 Prof. Sirinya's teaching style clicks for most (if not all) studentsCons:\u2013 There is no flexibility in pset deadlines and no late work is accepted\u2013 There is no exam drop\u2013 No cheat sheets on the examsTips for success:\u2013 Go to the exam reviews!! Although 2+ hours may seem like a waste of studying time, I can confidently say it helps to be there. I did significantly better on the 2 exams that I went to the review for, and did didn't do great on the midterm I didn't attend the review for. You can ask live questions and use it like a helproom afterwards.\u2013 Start studying at least one week in advance for the exams. You need time to sit with the material and let it sink in. It's definitely not something you can cram for.\u2013 Exam 2 was my worst exam. Watch out for that one because the material really ramps up with longer mechanisms and stereochemistry. \u2013 If an exam doesn't go well, change your strategy. I made a significant improvement between Exam 2 and 3 because I stopped trying to memorize mechanisms and started building an intuition by doing plenty of practice. \u2013 Start the psets on your own before going to helproom. The whole key to success is struggling with the material on your own first to really learn from it.\u2013 Go to at least 2 helprooms a week. I usually went Thursday night with CAs and Friday afternoon with the instructors. It's a big relief to finish the pset before the weekend and then go to helproom on Sat or Sun if you have any questions about the content. \u2013 Something I wish I did was review material after each lecture. Try and make a one\u2013page summary sheet with the reactions you learned each lecture or at least every week.",
      "I would like to tell them that yeah it\u2019s about as bad as you think it\u2019s gonna be. You\u2019re not going to understand a lot, and the kids that do understand the material will be so unbelievably loud about understanding it that you\u2019ll feel even stupider for not getting it. If you just can\u2019t understand it, no amount of practice will be able to help you. I guess I just didn\u2019t have the brain for it. You either do or you don\u2019t. I went through just about every practice problem and lecture problem and still couldn\u2019t understand anything. I spent so many nights crying over practice test problems because I knew that my efforts were useless and I would do bad on the exams, which ended up being true. If you know up front that organic chemistry isn\u2019t your strong suit, then good luck. Also, do NOT try to work any jobs while taking this course. That\u2019s probably a part of the reason for my awful, awful performance. Sorry for bringing down the averages, teaching team.",

How did Martines, Mozart, Beethoven, Sancho, and others create direction and closure in music with no text? We will then\u00a0shift our focus to art songs in the 19th\u00a0and 20th\u00a0centuries, by studying the\u00a0ways in which form, pitch, meter, and texture give rise to unique relationships between text and music in this repertoire. Lastly, we will delve\u00a0into issues of intertextuality, vocal performance, and musical covers\u00a0in the\u00a0recorded music of 20th- and 21st-century popular singers. Through various writing assignments\u2014concert reviews, liner notes, and analytical essays\u2014students will hone their music analytical skills by interpreting the ways in which music, voice, and\u00a0text are intertwined.",

Visits to various long-term ecological experiments and associated infrastructure will show students how climate change impacts are assessed, and discussions will emphasize how scientists predict future climate change through modeling. Students will prepare a written exercise following each weekend based on the topics discussed and will work on a final paper and presentation for a mini symposium on the last day of class.\u00a0The field trip format is intended to immerse students in an active field research setting and to allow extended small group discussion and interaction with a number of leading global change scientists at one of the preeminent field research sites in the U.S. Students will come away with an understanding of the types of ecological evidence for global warming and will be able to explain, to a broad audience, some of the major scientific methods used in predicting its consequences.",

      "If you are interested in climate change, global change, ecology, forests, carbon, or the history of New England's landscape, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!This is by far one of the best and most interesting classes I have ever taken! Besides the extremely interesting content of the class, the class itself was an incredible experience. You get to go to the forest, stay in a really nice house, and bond with 9 other students for a whole weekend, three times throughout the semester. These weekends served as extremely nice and relaxing breaks from the rest of the semester, and I still got a lot of work done for other classes at night while there. The group was great and had some of the nicest people I've met on campus, and since you will all share similar interests if you are in this class, there are endless things to talk about with the group. I personally found some great friends in the class, people who I will hopefully stay close with throughout the rest of my 4 years at Harvard. Additionally, as for the class itself, it was the best learning environment I have ever seen in a class. It provided an extremely immersive learning environment where we were enabled not only to be much more interested in what we learned, but we could have a dialogue about each topic and ask further questions about things that were not necessarily pointed out to us, since we were in an immersive environment where our own observations were appreciated and adapted into the fluently shifting yet curriculum\u2013based conversations. We got to see real, clear evidence of global change, learn why and how it happened, and how it can be mitigated or better understood through experiments that were occurring. The content was super interesting and I had some great conversations with Dave and the rest of the class about climate change and just anything that came up in conversation. It really helped me to see that there absolutely is a lot we can do about climate change, and inspired me even more to pursue research in my future. I think I understand global change, forests, and ecology much more than ever before as a result of this class, as there is just so much content, and it is provided in a very digestible and engaging manner.Dave is also great and such a knowledgeable guy, and is typically able to answer just about any question that the students ask him. I truly encourage all to apply for and take this course, it was seriously the best class I had this semester and an incredible introduction to Harvard.",

The topics are highly relevant to issues today. Explore the syllabus and see if the topics interest you. If you\u2019re even mildly curious, I think you will really enjoy it. The workload includes one section assignment per week, which usually took me 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. A key tip: start your capstone early! It requires a significant amount of time since you\u2019ll need to write a 2,500\u2013word essay, learn how to use the ArcGIS platform, and format and add visual elements. Both the section assignments and the capstone are engaging and rewarding. The TFs are friendly and helpful, and Jason is an amazing professor\u2014so approachable and kind. If you have the chance, invite him to Classroom to Table! Overall, take this course if you can\u2014you won\u2019t regret it!",
      "I would not recommend this class. The lectures were unengaging and didn't effectively convey much material. I felt like I didn\u2019t learn anything aside from the independent research I did for section assignments and the capstone project. The reading and lecture quizzes seemed intentionally tricky, focusing on minor details that were barely covered, and the grading across assignments was harsh for a GenEd course, so I ultimately had to take it pass/fail. If you\u2019re planning to take a GenEd pass/fail and don\u2019t mind not learning much, this class might work for you since it doesn\u2019t require a significant time commitment if you do take it pass/fail (if not, good luck memorizing every sentence for the quizzes). However, for me, once I realize I\u2019m not gaining anything from a class, it becomes a frustrating experience.",

The final exam was quite tough \u2013 make sure to review lectures thoroughly.  I can't directly compare to the spring version, but I think the fall version is great if you want to be able to ask questions in lecture and feel more engaged in a smaller class setting. It's also definitely helpful that it's not a 9am if you want to actually go to lecture! If you are looking for more of a small class experience, you want to go to lecture, and you think psets would help you understand the material, I would take this version. If you are looking to get the class over with using the least weekly work possible and have recorded lectures, I would take the spring version since there are not psets. I do think the spring version covers more content and might have slightly harder exams but am not 100% sure.",
      "A Frustrating and Useless Economics CourseThis course was an absolute disaster from start to finish. It is shocking how little thought seemed to go into making this class a worthwhile educational experience. Here are just a few of the glaring issues that made this class worth avoiding if possible:Problem Sets: A Marathon of TediumThe problem sets were absurdly long, often nearing 100 questions. This would be bad enough if they were meaningful, but they were anything but. Instead of fostering understanding, they devolved into tedious calculation marathons that added no real value to mastering the material. To make matters worse, many of the problems were structured to cascade: if you made a single mistake early on, it snowballed, guaranteeing you got several more questions wrong. This setup punished even minor errors and discouraged actual learning.Lectures: A Waste of TimeThe lectures were utterly unhelpful. The professor\u2019s slides were crammed with irrelevant math and equations\u2014stuff that didn\u2019t even align with the level of understanding required for the course. Rather than clarifying or simplifying concepts, the lectures left students more confused. If you walked in hoping for clear, concise explanations, you walked out disappointed (and more stressed than when you came in).Exams: Unreasonably Difficult and ArbitraryThe midterm and final exams were very difficult\u2014not because they tested mastery of the material, but because they were riddled with random, nitpicky questions. It\u2019s absurd to expect students to recall obscure tidbits from readings or parse the meaning of some minor detail on a graph buried in the lengthy textbook or one of the many readings assigned. This format doesn\u2019t measure understanding\u2014it\u2019s a scavenger hunt designed to trip students up. Add in the multiple\u2013choice calculation problems, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for disaster. A single small math error meant getting multiple questions wrong. This is an economics course, not a math competition!Overall Experience: Frustrating and PointlessUltimately, this course completely failed to fulfill the purpose of an economics class: TEACHING ECONOMICS. The relentless focus on excessive calculations and arbitrary details detracted from any meaningful engagement with broader concepts or critical thinking. Instead of leaving the class feeling enriched, I walked away frustrated, burnt out, and deeply disappointed. Every review I read on the Q before taking this course proved accurate, showing that the professor and the economics department clearly have no interest in improving this course or providing an enriching experience for future economists. If you're reading this and considering taking this course, don\u2019t be surprised if nothing changes. If you\u2019re taking this course as a requirement, it\u2019s doable, so don\u2019t stress too much. However, don\u2019t expect to gain much from it\u2014it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll walk away feeling like a more confident macroeconomist.",

      "This class is a wonderful introduction E&M class. It is so so so so so fantastic. Comparing this with the apphy, ps, ps12 series, I think you will do the most learning with this 15b class. It is academically challenging because it involves multivariable calculus, but I think Louis attempts to make it as painless as possible. Grade\u2013wise, sure you might not be getting the A that you wanted, but I think at the end of the day it\u2019s about the learning. If you are premed, maybe don\u2019t take about this class cuz it might drop your GPA, but I really think that if you want a good foundational understanding of E&M, this is a truly good class. There is a reason why most of the students in this class are not premeds and are more likely to be physics/engineering students All of the students are on the best no\u2013gatekeeping policy I know of. We truly help each other out, and I cannot ask for a better learning environment. As to what makes this class great:Louis \u2013 an outstanding lecturer, this is his first time he is teaching the class, so there was obvious some kinks here and there, but overall he really dumbs it down for basic understanding but then keeps all of the important details that needed to be understood there. He slows down some of the lecture material in order to ensure that no student is left behind. He posts really detailed lecture notes afterwards because the derivations can get cumbersome in class so he encourages to look at them after class to understand the steps that we took in class.Aurelian \u2013 the TF I had, the best TF I have ever had at Harvard hands down (I\u2019m a junior). A huge reason why I am no longer scared of this subject. (I was really apprehensive because of my previous physics class experience) He comes to section very well prepared. He goes over the lecture material and really dissects how we should approach a physics problem (e.g. step 1, 2, 3, \u2026) He breaks down misconceptions very well. I cannot sing enough praises for his teaching style. He lets us go off on our own for the first 5\u20137 minutes to attempt it on our own and goes around the classroom helping us out. This is also a perfect time to ask any lingering questions about the concept or the section problem. Then after those 5\u20137 minutes, he regroups the class and goes through problem, stopping to make sure we understanding the material, answering any questions we have, really encourages active participation and engagement. Other teaching staff \u2013 The amount of teaching support this class is super great. There is office hours basically every day. Shout out to Daria, Deb, Mary, Linda, Stefan, Rares, Aurelian, Louis for making this possible. Everyone was super devoted to helping students understand the course material. No question is a bad question. They prefer for you to ask your questions and settle misconceptions once and for all instead of letting these misconceptions fester. The psets are not super long, but they definitely require time, so don\u2019t leave them until physics night. I always get mine started over the weekend.Lab \u2013 confusing instructions at times, but you can get a lot more practical understanding of the concepts we learn in class in lab. It\u2019s two hours each week, so not too bad.",

Essentially, it's as close as an economist will ever come to engineering \u2014 plenty of optimization problems, which you'll get plenty comfortable with.  You'll benefit from a solid grounding in multivariate calc, and some background in probability theory, optimization, proof\u2013based courses, and differential equations would all be helpful (though not strictly required, perhaps).  All of this being said, Luis does a great job of bringing energy to his lectures and works with you to demystify a notoriously misunderstood and oversimplified branch of social science.  Building from the basic question of \"how can we even say things about how preferences map to economic decision making?\" and ending with \"what happens to an economy when we push on one thing just a little bit?\" this is a wonderful beginning\u2013to\u2013end exercise in understanding how to rigorously think through economic decisions and how they beget their own special equilibria.  Don't take the course if you're afraid of struggling with hard concepts.  Do take the course if you want to understand those hard concepts just a little more than you did before!",

There were a lot of assignments, and some were very time consuming, but the creative assignments were such a nice change of pace.

This might literally be a study hall for homework.Now Greg is a sweetheart and obviously an expert at what he does, but he also looks like he personally knew some of the Greek heroes back in the day. So, the main teaching is mostly left to the TFs, who are EXTREMELY hit or miss. I have heard of several people enjoying their sections, but for the most part, they are pretentious, snotty, sleep\u2013deprived, burnt\u2013out grad students trying to force a group of uninterested, busy undergrads to yap about some incoherent analysis.Also, if Hannah is a TF, AVOID HANNAH AT ALL COSTS\u2014this woman is literally the words pedantic, neurotic, and main\u2013character syndrome come to life. Every time she co\u2013led class, an audible groan could be heard from the auditorium, and whenever she was involved in lecture, it was a circus of Hannah imagining herself a deep intellectual and emanating cringe at nuclear levels.That being said, the course is still definitely a gem\u2014like actually close to zero workload. There are a lot of little assignments, but they\u2019re things you can grind out in a couple of minutes, and the quizzes are extremely doable just by skimming through the reading. Genuinely, the most time I ever spent on this outside of class was like an hour.So if you need a gem to balance out your schedule, take it.

Luckily, the class is led by two outstanding professors who truly have their student\u2019s interests and well\u2013being at heart. Both Suyang and Khaled stand out as being professors that truly value the student experience, which makes all the difference when it comes to upper level classes that are more complicated, as is the case with CHEM 160.Topics\u2013wise, this class is definitely a LOT. To be honest, there are still some topics that I do not understand at all. However, Suyang and Khaled definitely do their best in spite of this, as with having countless Office Hour sessions where they\u2019re willing to go above and beyond to help with comprehension and understanding. Unfortunately, quantum chemistry remains an extremely difficult concept, but the efforts by both Suyang and Khaled certainly make a difference.In terms of organization, CHEM 160 is very nice in the sense that you only have six total PSETs (the last one is optional though!) and a take\u2013home final, as well as a group presentation. This makes CHEM 160 a relatively easier to balance course in terms of the work\u2013load, although you certainly need to put in the time and effort to do well. As long as you don\u2019t mind being challenged, CHEM 160 is a great upper level class to fulfill your requirements!",

In terms of preparation I was a little scared because I hadn't taken physics or linear algebra but all you really need is a good grasp on basic calculus (you dont' really need linear algebra) and some physics (but not really, I took it at the same time as I took PS2) and it should be fine. The psets are not too hard and you only need to finish them every two weeks. The presentation was also not too bad, you just have to prepare it according to the rubric and that was it. The teaching staff is veryyy nice in helping with assignments so def go to OH. Prepare for the final, or at least prepare for it to be very long. It took me like 15+ hours but I think that was abnormal for this year"

      "This is the worst course that I've taken at Harvard. The flaws are numerous: 1. Should not be taught in IRAF. Modern astrophysics is done in python, leaving this course is very outdated.2. Course structure: it was always very unclear what tasks were required/graded, and most assignments were submitted through email...?3. Final project is very undirected. No assignment requirements or rubrics are provided, despite it almost entirely determining our grade.4. Final project support is minimal, but not at fault of the TFs. After completing data reduction, groups are left to do data analysis on their own (and all groups chose to do it in Python, as this is the modern coding language of astrophysics), but because each group is doing a different type of project, the TFs are not able to help very much. 5. After spring break, class time becomes equivalent to office hours, but attendance is still mandatory.6. Introductory lectures do not offer any educational value as they are, largely, covering material that is a prerequisite for the class.7. First half of the course is spent going through IRAF \"documents,\" which are outdated, riddled with typos and errors, and impossible to go through individually. They do not incentivize learning as they require dependence upon TFs \u2013 you get too bogged down in the outdated software to learn anything meaningful.8. I have not received any written feedback, in any form, for a single assignment this entire semester.The spring break trip to Arizona is pretty fun, especially if you have friends in the class. However, with the numerous glaring issues that this course presents, I do not think that it is anywhere near worth it.If you are considering taking this class to satisfy astro requirements, take any other course in the department before this one.

Kevin is very engaged with the course, his lectures are extremely effective (always attend lectures in person!!!) and he is always available for questions. The midterms in this class are pretty hard; make sure you really understand the material at a conceptual level, just doing calculations and \"following a checklist\" is not going to cut it.

I would honestly be more concerned with the midterms. I didn't find the section component particularly helpful, and since attending is not mandatory, I would recommend just going through the section worksheets on your own. Don't worry at all about the use of R, stat104 is not a coding class and you can always get help with any code during office hours/study break.

So if you like puzzles or are more of a visual thinker, the concepts won't be that difficult to understand.It is a fair amount of work with the weekly PSETs and FBGA labs, but doable. The textbook is actually really well\u2013written, and they encourage you to use AI to help you through the materials. PSETs + labs would easily take 2\u20135x longer if you don't use any AI.Lectures can be very dense, but Woody is one of the best STEM lecturers I've had at Harvard.

Through the systematic comparison of several cases, the course discusses how ideas of race have shaped processes of nation and state formation in Latin America, shaping opportunities for mobilization and public policies; how racial identities have been formed and invoked for different cultural and political purposes; and how ideas of race and ethnicity have contributed to the stratification of Latin American societies, which are among the most unequal in the world.",

There is a good level of depth in many topics, like studying neural networks in the infinite width limit (neural tangent kernels) but I felt overall that the course had too much breadth and could have instead focused on covering fewer topics in greater detail. The lectures are interesting and the instructor is great at explaining hard concepts. The first few problem sets were quite long and somewhat hard, but later ones became easier. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in learning the historical progression of deep learning, since this course starts from the perceptron (which itself demonstrates very interesting behavior) and builds up from there. This perspective also helps build intuition about many things taken for granted in modern deep learning, such as model architecture, learning rules, etc.",

It may be difficult in the beginning of the course to adjust to some of the matrix algebra if that is not something you use a lot but honestly I think one gets the hang of it by Midterm I. If you are at all interested in unsupervised learning or other data analysis techniques, I think this is a great class to take.

Should we think of morality and moral development as something natural or artificial? Are we justified in caring more about some people (our closest friends and family) than others? We will have a special focus on three important interpretive themes for the course: (1) How can understanding the particular contours of the debates each scholar is engaged in help us understand their overall views? (2) How does each philosopher\u2019s view of human psychology and epistemology constrain, guide, and support their moral theorizing? (3) How can an understanding of early Chinese ethical thought, theory, and debate help enrich contemporary discussions in ethics and moral philosophy?

As our communication becomes ever more digital\u2014 and, therefore, simultaneously more ephemeral and more durable\u2014the attitudes and tools we have for preserving our culture have come to seem less apt than they may have seemed as recently as a generation ago. This course examines how texts have been transmitted from the past to the present, and how we can plan for their survival into the future. We will examine what makes texts durable by considering especially the media by which they are transmitted, the changing cultural attitudes toward their content, and the institutions by which they are preserved. The European Renaissance will provide a central case study. During this period scholars became aware of the loss of ancient texts and strove to recover and restore them insofar as possible. These interests prompted new developments in scholarly conservation techniques which we still value today (philology, libraries, and museums) but also the creation and transmission of new errors, ranging from well-intentioned but overzealous corrections and \u201cimprovements\u201d to outright forgeries. What can the Renaissance teach us about how to engage productively with these problems, both as the source of our current attitudes toward preservation and loss, and as a case study of another culture dealing with anxiety over preservation and loss? Ultimately, we hope that students will be able to think productively about preservation in the past and in the future, while recognizing that all preservation inherently involves some kind of transformation.",

In addressing these issues, we will consider several core questions: 1) How do patterns of food consumption reflect existing inequalities?, 2) How do patterns of food consumption contribute to social inequalities?, 3) How do cultural constructions of what people eat compound these inequalities?, and 4) How might we reduce food-related inequalities?

      "Don't take this course unless a lot of things change. The theme: unclear, unfair, and changing expectations. I am a STEM concentrator who took this course as an elective and had the following issues with it: the expectations were unclear, the teaching style was all lecture, it was not an intro level course in some respects but too much in others, and the assignments were both too much and unclear in expectation. I love art and Italian culture, but this course lost all of the wonder. Yes, you can work hard and probably do well. But in the last few days of the course (during reading period) they told us it would be curved down and that only a few As would be given out. Had I know this, I would NOT have taken this course. I know it is not good to only want an A, but as a STEM concentrator I wanted exposure to new topics while having the ability to do well. I know only the HAA concentrators will be able to get As due to this. There were issues like this at every step of the course that must be addressed in order to make it better. Here are the issues:The exams were not clearly laid out until right before they occurred. The final format was only told to us five days before the exam (during reading period!), which was not helpful for preparation or stress levels. The essays also had unclear goals except at the end for the last essay when a rubric was finally provided. Examples of how to write a formal analysis would be great, as the reading was helpful but as someone who studies STEM and had never interacted with any content like this at all was incredibly confusing with expectations. The slide tests were unpredictable in timing and led to a lot more stress and time spent on this course than I think was needed. Setting dates for them would be helpful for learning and reducing stress. The slide tests were said to be given at the start of class but never were. This led to everyone being stressed throughout the class until the last fifteen minutes. This is incredibly unconducive to learning and attention and needs to be addressed. There were many assignments in this course that it felt like too much for an intro class (three essays, two exams, 4 slide tests, many readings that had to be done)The reliance on blank lecture slides and writing down everything said by the professor did not seem like the best way to engage with the works, even though there is a lot of information I wish this class was taught in a small non lecture or less lecture format with use of newer and more effective learning strategies. The TFs provided short comments on the essays that were helpful but I would have loved more feedback as someone who has not written an essay in college in a long time. The feedback on what counts as a \"fact\" on a slide test was also constantly changing and unclear, which was not in line with learning and preparing well for them or the class. This was advertised as an intro course but it did not feel that way. I am a STEM concentrator with little introduction to classical literature and art, important art historians, or religious background. None of these were well explained for a person without the knowledge. Especially with the religious stories, we were expected to know and understand the saints and other things that I did not, making it hard to see the symbols in the works. I think more focus on teaching to a student who has no background would be great, or removing the word intro in the title and making it for HAA concentrators!This course taught me the things I memorized while studying for exams, but I lost a lot of the wonder for the art and the process along the way as a function of the layout of the course.The sunlight is the TFs. They were so nice and tried to make the best of it, but still the course was not great overall.",

How did literary identities intersect status identities? Did models of creativity from earlier periods shape early modern conceptions of authorship? Can we trace the role of readers and fans in the shaping the figure of the author? How should we understand the striking gender segregation apparent in early modern authorship? We will examine poetic treatises, author biographies, playwrighting manuals, works of fiction, visual representations of writers past and present, encyclopedias and theatrical ephemera, letters, and works of social history concerning status, selfhood, and labor.

    "qrating": 4.57,
    "course_description": "Julian of Norwich (born 1343) and Margery Kempe of Lynn (born 1373) are the two earliest women writers in English whose names we know. They lived thirty years and thirty miles apart, met only once over a period of some days, and wrote long, completely different books, both inspired by what they understood as visionary encounters with the divine. Julian was a Christian intellectual, a brilliant writer, intensely visual but also abstract, who spent a lifetime writing and rewriting an intricate and optimistic analysis of how to live as an aspiring and suffering human being in the world that many people around the world still live by. Margery (she did not much like her husband\u2019s name) was a religious experimentalist, devout globe-trotter and performance artist, equally brilliant, whose energies seemed to have gone into living more than writing, but who in old age dictated then revised what many understand as the first English autobiography. After being mostly ignored for several hundred years, they are now being read with care, although by different readerships and in different ways. It is time they were brought together again.In this discussion-based course, we read Julian of Norwich\u2019s Revelation of Love\u00a0and The Book of Margery Kempe\u00a0 alongside one another, as well as in the light other women writers who drew inspiration from visions, revelations, or dreams, from the early Christian martyr Perpetua of Carthage in the third century CE to the reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson in the nineteenth. We pay particular attention to Julian and Margery\u2019s direct precursors, Angela of Foligno, Gertrude the Great, and Marguerite Porete, among others. We consider how it was that revelations were able to make an innovative, demanding and prestigious mode of thought and writing possible for women who were excluded by their gender from the formal education available to male contemporaries. We think about what revelations are, how they function as an embodied, kinetic, and dialogic mode of consciousness, and the stylistic and intellectual experimentation this mode of consciousness enables. We speculate on potential connections between the visionary and other non-natural ways of seeing the world. Finally, we consider the excruciating difficulty of being and writing as a visionary and the cultural and psychic pressures the role of visionary involved and involves. Although the main setting of the course is the world of Julian and Margery, we do not forget that we are reading them in the now.",

      "For context, I am a STEM concentrator who took this course as an elective. I had not previously taken any courses in the English department and had little to no prior knowledge of visionaries, though I consider myself an avid bookworm.This course was incredibly educational \u2013\u2013 Professor Watson is immensely knowledgeable about the topics this course covers; I often felt as though I was given access to a treasure trove by being able to listen to him lecture. As much as students wanted to talk, he would let them talk, but it also seemed as though he had endless insightful comments to add to whatever conversation we were having. Much of the information he lectured to us at the beginning of class before discussion was very difficult to find online, meaning I was able to get so much more out of reading the works in his class than I would have reading them on my own.With that being said, I did sometimes have to put in a lot of extra effort to keep up with the discussion in class, primarily due to most of the class being significantly more familiar with the materials (either having read their works before, or having vast knowledge of the contexts around visionary writings). This wasn't a bad thing \u2013\u2013 particularly if you do have prior knowledge since the conversation was very engaged and occurred at a relatively high level \u2013\u2013 but, if you're someone like me who had little prior knowledge of the materials before enrolling, I would find time to talk to Professor Watson beforehand \u2013\u2013 he is very down\u2013to\u2013earth and helpful, which made the readings and gap in understanding between myself and some of my peers much more manageable. Past just the course material, he helped me strengthen my writing in general and cared about his students at an individual level. If you find the material interesting and are willing to put in the time to do (most) of the readings, you won't regret taking this course (or really, any course with Professor Watson).",

To study materiality, the course includes a lab section where students will examine closely textiles and articles of clothing in the collections of the Harvard Museums, and engage in materials workshops (learning for example weaving and dyeing techniques). Students will be encouraged to make connections between form and function and meaning, and to incorporate a knowledge of technological constraint and possibility into their own analyses of clothing and fashion.",

The course is structured very well, with sections reinforcing the concepts we cover in lecture, and psets reinforcing both lecture and section by reviewing in depth the models we cover. Gabriel is so kind and approachable, which goes a long way in making students feel like they belong in the class. Kartik is a genius and is so good at reviewing the content. I don't get how he words everything so well in real\u2013time, but he does, and it's honestly amazing. The way he explains complex models and breaks them down step by step makes everything so much clearer. Both Gabriel and Kartik are incredibly supportive, and they create such a welcoming environment where everyone feels comfortable asking questions and engaging with the material. This has definitely been my favorite economics class so far, and I can't recommend it enough!!",

We examine common-sense assumptions about culture, politics, history, and psychology, and empower students to replace them with evidence-based reasoning. This gateway course introduces students to the intellectual insights and analytical tools of Sociology across the subfields of race, class, gender, politics, violence, culture, and inequality. Students are trained to critically analyze the evidence and research methods used in sociological research, and to communicate sociological ideas powerfully and succinctly through effective policy writing. Whether you plan to become a doctor who understands the social determinants of health, an education expert seeking to improve US schools, a not-for-profit worker supporting community organization, or a corporate consultant looking to improve organizational efficiency, the foundational concepts and research practices of sociology will empower you to understand, analyze\u2014and maybe even change\u2014our social world.",

(It will not focus on field research, as there are more focused courses for that.) Whereas the course will discuss papers from strategy and closely related fields, it is not a survey of models in these fields or any subfield but will simply draw on these literatures to provide material to learn about theory and theory development. At the same time, the ultimate focus will be intently on the strategy field (and areas that feed directly into strategy).PrerequisitesThe course is for PhD students intending to do research in strategy or closely related fields.Prerequisites for the course are HBS 4010 and 4011 (Micro-economics 1 and 2) and HBS 4110 (Foundations of Strategy) or equivalent.

    "course_description": "The fossil record offers a unique perspective on the history of Life on Earth. Although palaeontology might remind us of grotesque bones, dusty museum cabinets, and quirky scientists who relish both of those things\u2014or God forbid, Ross Geller from Friends\u00ad\u2014the knowledge derived from the fossil record affects our daily lives in ways that are not immediately apparent. From its natural history origins during the 19th century, paleontology has become a cornerstone of neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought, produced a detailed log of climate change, and sits at the center of a multi-billion-dollar business consumed by millions of people around the world, most likely yourself included. This seminar will explore the rich world of paleontology and its bearing on human activities. You will learn how cutting-edge scientific research informs our understanding of the main processes that have influenced the evolution of Life on Earth for approximately four billion years, including episodes of global warming/cooling and mass extinction events. You will also gain insights into the socioeconomic impact of fossils, ranging from the seamless integration of charismatic extinct animals into culture and entertainment, to ethical and political quandaries resulting from the unregulated exploitation of these natural resources in conflict zones. Finally, we will explore how technological advances blur the lines between science fiction and reality, allowing us to visualize diminutive, fossilized animal-like embryos from 600 million years ago, to the potential (and controversial) applications of gene editing to resuscitate extinct species such as the wooly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger.",

This course approaches this topic by examining key debates in feminism, speech, and representation. Topics include critiques of pornography, cancel culture, trigger warnings, hate speech, slurs, and cultural appropriation. We will begin by orienting ourselves to the legal frameworks of the freedom of speech in the North American and European contexts before turning to philosophical and critical theories analyzing the possible impacts of\u00a0incendiary\u00a0language on our democratic ideals. Our goal is to unpack the civic foundations of our democracy and interrogate the societal and ethical questions around subordinating speech.

These clashes amounted to a borderless slave war: war to enslave, war to expand slavery, and war against slaves, precipitating wars waged by the enslaved against slaveholders, but also between slaves themselves.

An axiom of contemporary life is that societies need law to address social, political and environmental ills. Yet, in the face of entrenched problems, law often appears impotent or, worse, detrimental. This course grapples with the simultaneous hunger for and weakness of law, its power and its powerlessness, by guiding students through an exploration of the following questions. What is the relation between law and violence? How does legal process transform conflict and define the terms of its resolution? Can law restrain arbitrary power? How, why and to whose benefit or expense is the legal posed as an answer to political and social problems? The course will seek answers to these questions via an engagement with the ethnographic \u2013 close readings of a variety of judicial processes -- and the theoretical. In so doing, the course will be guided by two objectives: 1. to compile a toolkit of methods and concepts with which social scientists have studied law and 2. to trouble commonsense pieties about law and its place in social life.",

Students will read classical scholarship and emerging research on social movements, collective identity, polarization, political narratives, and more. We will explore questions such as: Why do some political narratives spread faster and farther than others? How do group divisions between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d develop? What role does social media play in the success of social movements? (How) has our political discourse become polarized? Students will develop an original research project on a relevant topic of interest. The methodological focus will be on text-as-data, with students learning how to find and acquire text data and analyze it through both qualitative and computational means. Examples of data that students may explore include social media posts, newspaper articles, political speeches, and television transcripts.",

      "TAKE THIS CLASS 10000%%%% it is a truly special class with an incredible professor and great TFs!!!! There are a lot of classes that if everyone in the school or in the country took, it would do the world a lot of good. This is the best example of that\u2014I think everyone should take it. If you need an elective for Ec then DEFINITELY take it, but still take it regardless of major, because it has so much interesting content and is relevant to every field. You will learn about puzzles/problems in global health and how people have tried to address them in the past and what worked and what did not, but you will mostly learn about how to tackle these problems and what epistemological issues led to poor solution\u2013development in the past. Professor Basilico is brilliant and will change the way you see the world\u2014I came out of this class a more optimistic person about lots of development issues around the world, and was motivated to do the readings (which are all fascinating and super understandable!!) including the textbook which he wrote which summarizes things really nicely and in a thought\u2013provoking way. You'll learn the methods of lots of quasi\u2013experimental methods in economic research on development/health issues and also how to read and understand the numbers in those papers, which is super useful in general. They also offer lots of support for the final project, so talk to the TFs and the professor about whatever you are curious/confused about and they'll be great help.Definitely take it\u2014you will have a great time and learn so much.",

Is literary criticism a practical or a theoretical enterprise? Does criticism combine philosophy and history while remaining separate from each (as Aristotle thought)? In what ways can criticism draw illuminating connections between a poet\u2019s work and a poet\u2019s life? What kind of attention can criticism pay to language, meter, genre, and literary history? Above all, what is the relation of criticism to the political and of the political to the aesthetic? Milton criticism over three centuries provides a unique archive for considering how criticism has been practiced over time. We follow the development from classic criticism (Marvell, Johnson, Voltaire, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Hazlitt, Blake, Equiano, Wollstonecraft, Arnold, Raleigh) to modern ones (Woolf, Eliot, Lewis, Empson, Frye, Schwartz, Quint, Greenblatt, Nyquist, Jameson, Wilburn, Mohamed, Lewalski, Vendler).",

    "course_description": "It is common to read in the paper about the coming climate crisis, framed as a matter of saving the environment or planet. Less often invoked, however, is an older, more metaphysical notion of \u2018nature naturing\u2019 actively (natura naturans). When (if ever) did the concept of the \u2018environment\u2019 replace that of nature? What are the exact differences between the terms we use to refer to the planet as our shared home, whether \u2018nature,\u2019 \u2018(e/E)arth,\u2019 \u2018world,\u2019 \u2018environment,\u2019 \u2018planet,\u2019 or \u2018globe\u2019? And what ramifications might the semantic shifts between these six terms have for current environmental debates?]\u00a0This interdisciplinary course asks these questions by examining three phases in the history of the idea of nature as instigated by key German poets, thinkers, and visual artists. Beginning with the period around 1800, we will reconstruct the tensions animating Romanticism\u2019s holistic conception of nature by reading works by Kant, Goethe, Schelling, and Alexander von Humboldt, while the landscape paintings of Caspar David Friedrich will furnish our artistic case study. Turning to the first half of the twentieth century, we will encounter the first use of the German term Umwelt (\u2018environment\u2019) in its modern sense in the work of theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, who was friends with the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. We will reconstruct Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of modern technology and compare and contrast his conception of the artwork\u2019s ties to \u2018earth\u2019 and \u2018world\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis comparison to Schelling\u2019s theory of the artwork\u2019s relation to nature. Our exemplary artist for this second phase is Paul Klee, who grounded his aesthetic vision in nature\u2019s formative processes. Approaching our contemporary moment, we will read literary works by W.G. Selbald while attending to the political and communicative vicissitudes of coming to societal awareness of a transhistorical phenomenon such as climate change. Joseph Beuys\u2019s politico-aesthetic agitations and the first photos of the Earth taken from outer space provide our last artistic case studies. German students and majors will meet in an additional weekly section to discuss excerpts of select texts in German.",

      "DO NOT take this class if it is taught by Professor Giuliana Bruno or the TF Aden Solway. You can try it out if it is with another professor. This is truly one of the worst courses I\u2019ve taken in my entire academic career. I do not understand how a course\u2014especially one that serves as a requirement for new AFVS graduate students and has been in existence for years\u2014could be taught in such a way. 1. Lack of Basic Organization: I don\u2019t understand why some readings are included in the syllabus when they weren\u2019t discussed or connected to any future readings. Each week feels completely disjointed from the others. While I understand that this is intended to be a broad survey course in Film & Visual Studies, it neither traces the genealogy of theoretical engagement within the field nor even attempts to explain why the figures we read are important. It feels more like a list of readings than a cohesive curriculum. I\u2019m sure that other professors, who are more familiar with the field\u2019s recent developments, could have created a syllabus that is more relevant and engaging. 2. Lack of Structured Class Time: We did not have \u201cclass\u201d in the traditional sense. I\u2019ve experienced many different styles of teaching in graduate seminars, and I\u2019m usually very open to them. However, this class was beyond me. I don\u2019t understand how a two\u2013hour class is structured into: one hour of student presentations, 50 minutes of the professor telling trivia and life stories, and 10 minutes of questions from the teaching fellow, often focusing on irrelevant issues and grilling people on them. I had many questions and would have loved to discuss them with my classmates. Our cohort brought diverse knowledge from various fields, but we were never allowed the time to engage with each other. Because of the time spent on other \u201cimportant\u201d matters, I didn\u2019t learn much in this class, and I\u2019m sure my classmates would agree with me. A professor who genuinely cared about how their class went would have noticed that student participation stopped after Week 5. While you might think this means that it's less work for you, it is not. You're left confused on all the assignments and all the \"instructions\" come post hoc in the form of criticism on things you didn't even know were in consideration.  3. Lack of Accessibility from the Professor: The professor is NEVER accessible. The only interaction I had with Professor Giuliana Bruno was when I asked her a question after class, and her response was a single sentence. She doesn\u2019t respond to emails, does not hold office hours, and never provides any feedback on our assignments. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s considered a \u201cteacher.\u201d On the bright side, she is not a mean person. She will say hi to you if you encounter each other in the Carpenter Center.  4. Disparaging Teaching Fellow: The teaching fellow, Aden Solway, was incredibly disparaging to everyone. Office hours with him were awful, as the 30\u2013minute session consisted of him tearing apart your project, diminishing its value, and pushing his own ideas onto it, trying to bend it to what he deemed worthy. The TF is the only person that grades anything and gives you feedback. I don\u2019t think he should be allowed to teach until he learns how to respect his peers and the work of others.",

The guest speakers were definitely one of the best parts of the class. They brought real\u2013world perspectives that helped connect the material to real\u2013life experiences, making the course content much more engaging and accessible. Their personal stories really brought the issues to life in a way that statistics and theories alone couldn\u2019t. I also really enjoyed the course section with Kyle\u2014it provided an opportunity to dive deeper into topics like education, low\u2013wage work, homelessness, and housing, exploring how they are all interconnected and contribute to poverty. These discussions were thought\u2013provoking and sparked some truly meaningful conversations.That said, be prepared for a heavy reading load each week\u2014it can get overwhelming if you're not on top of your time management. But if you can manage it, this course will definitely expand your perspective and help you understand the structural issues that keep poverty in place. One of the things I loved most about this course is that there are NO EXAMS\u2014just field report assignments, which are only five pages, and the final is another field report plus a five\u2013page reflection on the class. I really liked this because it gave us the chance to conduct interviews or observational studies, which made the assignments feel more hands\u2013on and connected to real\u2013world issues. TAKE THIS CLASS\u2014it\u2019s easy and a great way to learn about such an important subject. Plus, Professors Waldman and Wallerstein are both so nice and supportive!",

How it can amplify, interpret and extend the message of the production to the viewer through delight, astonishment and provocation. Together we will explore how costume design can even assist in changing a cultural narrative.\u00a0The instructor will first demonstrate the design process that a costume designer undertakes, from start to finish. Students will learn how to read and research existing dramatic text as a designer and how to manifest their vision through visual terms acting as director and designer. After carefully following the steps of a professional costume designer preparing for theatrical work, students in the class undertake an individual design project, from start to finish, under the supervision of the instructor.\u00a0Students with prior experience will be challenged to further their character and conceptual development using critical thought, color, silhouettes, proportions and fabric.",

      "This is a fun creative course to take if you have a bit of free space for an elective. It's really one\u2013of\u2013a\u2013kind at Harvard and you will learn things on a really practical level. You will start to see the behind\u2013the\u2013scenes of each costume in a movie or theatre play, get to talk to people creating all these things and touch costumes with you own hands. It was really fun to draw again after so many years and I really appreciated Dede being so open to my slightly unhinged designs. Overall, as long as you put in some effort and interest into this, I think you should be ok.",
      "I think this class is fun, but if you are thinking this class will just be fun and not require a lot of work, then you are wrong. The assignments take a lot more time than you expect so the class will be much more stressful than you think. You also do not get to do as much designing as you might think. The class focuses more on getting you thinking in the initial stages of designing and the process an actual costume designer would take when given a new script.",

      "This is a pretty interesting course, but it is a difficult one. This was probably one of my favorite courses at Harvard, even though I didn't do too well on the final (sorry Joe). That said, if you're really interested in probability theory, I would definitely recommend taking this course. However, if you're a bit more worried about your grade and time spent on classes, then this might not be the course for you. For context, took this course as an undergrad (senior). Prerequisites: STAT 110 and comfort with proofs. If you have taken a proof\u2013based math course (e.g. Math 22/25/55/112) or a proof\u2013based CS course (CS120/121/124 series or 128), you're probably prepared for the course. There is this question that's posed every year on whether you need real analysis background (Math 112) for this course, but personally I really don't think you need it. It may help as Joe suggests, but you can get through the course and do well without real analysis background. The course also tends to be more probability focused especially on the exams, so I don't think prior experience in real analysis is necessarily super beneficial. So, if you're worried about real analysis, I wouldn't be! You may just need to put a little bit more effort, but there's plenty of students who take this course without having taken real analysis. Joe also makes the real analysis portion of the class pretty self\u2013contained. Homeworks: They're hard, especially the first one on measure theory. They really involve a lot of thinking, which I enjoyed, but it could be time consuming. Exams: Also hard, but there's a lot of practice exams and practice problems in the book, so your performance is typically really based on how much time you spend practicing. Overall, would recommend the course!",
      "Stat 210 is a really interesting continuation of Stat 110 at a slightly more rigorous level and pace. Joe is a very passionate lecturer, so I personally found it enjoyable to attend lectures. This course is more theory\u2013based (although Joe tries to make it accessible to all), and so the first few units of measure theory will be annoying, but after that the content is fun (representations!, MVN, limit theorems, etc...) Exams are difficult, but since they were in\u2013person for the first time this year (as opposed to previous years), Joe does scale the difficulty accordingly. Real analysis also is NOT needed; this was something I was worried about prior to taking the course. It can help, especially with the convergence proofs, but not necessary. The only negative about this course is that solutions to the textbook 'pencil problems' are not readily available (compared to the plethora of Stat 110 solutions available); solutions to the practice final exams were also not given, except for one year's.",

Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention, biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum. The course is intended for PhD students in the Business Economics and Economics programs and others who have a solid background in microeconomic theory at the level of introductory PhD courses in these programs. While obviously appropriate to those wishing to specialize in \"behavioral economics\", the course is also designed for those interested in doing research in particular fields of economics. And while the course centers on theoretical models (learning and evaluation will center around solving formal problem sets), the theory is focused towards its empirical implementability and economic relevance, so that the course is also designed for those interested in theory-influenced empirical research.",

We will read, discuss and consider case studies that reflect lived experiences from diverse communities and contexts across a variety of topics and frameworks within the discipline. As we walk through on-the- ground and recorded examples of ethnographic/ archaeological research, we will explore and compare different approaches in identifying research problems, conducting research, and writing anthropologically. We will also read latest works produced by departmental faculty, including your Tutor, to get a sense of the range of topics, questions, and new methods that are possible in anthropological research. This course also offers you a space to then apply what you have learned through designing your projects and sharing your research goals, experiences, and components of your emerging work with peers for feedback. Through structured assignments, seminar workshops, discussions with invited faculty and regular individual meetings with instructors, you will produce an original anthropological essay based on your research over the course of the semester. In short, this course will arm you with the critical tools to start thinking about your own independent research project. Please note that the research project you start to brainstorm in this course does not have to be your Senior Thesis project. In other words, your chosen research topic for this semester is only for the purposes of this course, and you are not confined to this research topic beyond this semester, although you can certainly continue to pursue this same research topic. As part of this course, you will be asked to reach out to at least one departmental faculty member to discuss the direction and feasibility of your research ideas. Please note that this course has a weekly 1.5 hour course meeting that is complemented with 1 hour tutorial/section meetings with your Tutor.",

Why does the Mexico-U.S. border continue to be a space of discussion and controversy? In the twenty-first century, as nations across the world militarize or rebuild their borders, the U.S.-Mexico border serves as a vital case study to understand the ongoing trend of tightening national borders\u2014it also allows us to better understand our own history, politics, and how we shape our view of the world. In addition to examining the creation of the U.S.-Mexico border in 1848 to the present, this course examines how ideas of public health have historically been used in border debates. For many, the border served (and serves) as a protective barrier from poverty, violence, and, especially, disease. By the early twentieth century many Mexican bodies were perceived as \u201calien,\u201d \u201cillegal,\u201d and in need of patrolling. Yet these descriptions were also used by Mexican politicians to describe and isolate Indigenous groups and the Chinese within Mexico. By examining, for example, border ecological disasters, response to epidemics and a pandemic, and how ideas of race and health played out within Mexico and the U.S. we can better understand borders in general.",

      "If you are a sociology major, I would encourage you to take this course over Stat 100. It is definitely more tailored to the social sciences and from what I heard, also a bit more manageable.  This course was small enough that you could get to know the professor 1\u20131 and get help that way. Additionally, my TF section leader Soroush was very kind and always eager to help whether that meant moving his availability around to help me. Seriously, he once met with me while he was at the airport about to go on vacation so that I could understand how to do my final project analysis. I came into this course with no coding background whatsoever, and the assignments in this course, while definitely a bit challenging, were doable. Yes, I would be confused during lecture, but attending section taught me whatever I didn't get during the lecture. That said, if you struggle with R like I did, try to block out time to do p\u2013sets. I wish I had started earlier than when I usually did so that I could have attended office hours since some concepts required more time than I thought. The professor is also very kind and would slow down during lectures when he noticed students were grasping what he was teaching. This teaching team was very responsive to student needs and I appreciated that. I wouldn't call this course a gem but if you put in the effort, it can be. Do go to office hours and sections, especially if you have no background because without it, I do not see you being successful.  The final paper, while intimidating, is broken down throughout the semester. For example, we turned in our abstracts in October, our code in November, and finally the project in December. The teaching team does their best to prepare students for this during class so it's not just ignored. The midterm was open\u2013notes and you could use past p\u2013sets so as long as you have a rough idea of the content until then, you should be good to go. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, even though I hate coding, as it was well organized. Once again, if you are a sociology major, I'd take this over any other options to fulfill the requirement.",

      "If you're interested in systems security, this class is definitely for you! Mickens is a wonderful lecturer, the 3 projects were very fun to do, they're challenging enough to be interesting, but at the same time definitely doable (I didn't feel the need to go to office hours at all). The late policy is definitely harsh, but you're given at least 2 weeks for every project (and in my experience, a project took no more than 2 days to finish, but this definitely depends on programming experience). The readings were consistently interesting to do. The class was still lecture\u2013style so you don't really discuss the papers, but you still submit some observation/questions you have about the reading assignment before every class. Regarding exams: Mickens has a very distinct exam style that focuses on more conceptual questions (which is very different from the usual exam style in CS 61). On this end, I just wished there would be practice exams, but there weren't any that I could find. For exam preparation, I recommend rewatching lectures and ensuring you feel confident on the topics. There's a final project component that you do within groups of 2\u20133 people, and the difficulty of the project really depends on the topic you select. Overall, I highly recommend this class, but definitely be mentally prepared \u2013 it's very non trivial.",

The content was so interesting and included (but was certainly not limited to) how the brain communicates, how the brain is organized, how the visual system works, how you perceive touch, how some neuroscience experiments are conducted, how learning might occur, and some interesting features of consciousness. I recommend this class to everyone; you will develop a much better appreciation of how complicated you are as a sapient being! Really try to take this class at some point during your four years here.In terms of workload, you will require a significant amount of diligence outside of class. Before each class, you have to watch 2\u20134 video lectures that are usually altogether an hour to an hour and half in total length. Individual videos range from about 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the total length of all the videos typically stays consistent. You are expected to know pretty much all of it on the tests and exams, so I recommend taking detailed notes. I would not just look at the slides or read the notes posted on Canvas; I found that I learned the content much better if I watched all the lecture videos. I would also try not to fall behind as it can be difficult to catch up since you will have new videos to watch. If you keep yourself honest and actually watch and take detailed notes on all the lectures, you will have a much better time preparing for the exams.The section quality depends on the TF. If you go to a certain TF the first week and do not think they are a good teacher, consider talking to your friends about their experiences and, if possible, switching to a section of someone who had a positive experience. Personally, I very much liked my TF (Alex Chen). He was an excellent explainer and fostered a chill, friendly environment in the classroom.Overall, this course is great!

      "Wow, this course was a lot. Reading the Q guide from previous years, I took this class expecting to improve my spanish in a small\u2013class setting, in a relatively low stress way. I came in having some spanish background from high school, but having forgotten a lot of it. While the class was very small (6 students including me), it turned out to be pretty stressful and a lot of work. THIS CLASS IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTOR DEPENDENT!!! Majo, the instructor this year, was very energetic and excited to teach, which made the class fun, especially at 9 am. But she was definitely strict in certain ways, much more than last year's instructor. First, we were only allowed 3 absences, which is very few for a 9 am that meets every day (over 60 times total throughout the semester).  These absenses included religious and medical absences, which was a bit crazy. Also be prepared for the commitment this class takes ... there are nightly Canvas modules, 22 graded homeworks, 5 written exams, 5 class presentations, 5 reports to accompany the presentations, 3 conversations you need to have with native speakers with follow up written reports, all on top of showing up  every morning and actually putting in the time outside of class to learn the material. While I enjoyed the class at times, especially toward the beginning of the semester, the sheer number of assignments became overbearing and frustrating by about the half\u2013way point. I often felt like I was doing busywork that wasn't actually improving my spanish. The best assignments/classes/activities were the ones where we could talk to native speakers and classmates about everyday things because that is most realistic if traveling to a spanish speaking country, but these activities were few and far between the long writing assignments and sometimes long homeworks.  Despite it being a lot of work, I am definitely coming out of this class better at speaking spanish and writing spanish. I am very appreciative of this.To conclude, if you put in the work in this class, everything will work out just fine (you will learn a lot and do well), but make sure you have the time before committing to taking it. It definitely feels like an 8 credit class.",

      "This class had a couple real gems in lectures, but could overall use some improvement. CONTENTThe course covered a wide variety of topics in training foundation models. In particular, it began with basic backprop + gradient descent, edge of stability, optimization techniques and theory, sharding, training pipeline (pre/mid/post), parallelization, generative AI, inference, with interspersed topics taught by guest lectures: Jonathan Frankle (databricks), Roy Frostig (jax), Julia Neagu / Deanna Emery (QuotientAI), Vahan Petrosyan / Leo Linden (SuperAnnotate), and Jacob Austin (Google Deepmind). The main instructors for the content were Sham and various Kempner postdocs. The material is largely interesting, but not very organized.  Some of the lectures were quite interesting, for instance Frankle discussed some relatively original takes; the first two lectures had some intriguing theoretical content, etc. However, several lectures depend critically on familiarity; for instance, I think it is very difficult to take anything out of a jax lecture if one has not worked with the language before. For many lectures, without references or implementation exercises, it was difficult to take something concrete; for instance, in either the parallelization lectures or the generative AI lectures (both of which were interesting, but some exercises would have been nice). Overall, a fun class to take which is low\u2013workload and is essentially a sequence of seminar talks, and not necessarily an organized and very rigorous course.HWThere were three HWs which constituted two of Sasha Rush\u2019s puzzles (available publicly on GitHub). This caused the class to be very easy in terms of workload; however, I wish there were HW assignments which more accurately described the content. For instance, it would have been nice to actually train a model using parallel compute, actually implement some of the optimization techniques, use JAX, implement generative models (e.g. diffusion, etc.). PROJECTThere is a project at the end of the course. This project is pretty open\u2013ended and is a good opportunity for students to engage in some original work in ML, and I appreciate it as the only major assignment of the course. There are a few milestones where we received decent feedback. Again, I think it would have been nice for there to be some starting guidelines, possibly in the HW assignments, for places to start; generating ideas was an interesting but relatively nontrivial process.",

      "Great class! Definitely more difficult than I was expecting, though. The exams were not hard in the normal sense, more just challenging because they were weird, at least compared to other physics classes. It was hard to get partial credit on several problems, and the topics seemed a bit niche. The exam reviews were super helpful in highlighting what would be important, though. Also, there were no practice materials for the exams, which made it even harder to know what to expect. I would not say the exams were unfair, but they were hard to prepare for in a way that maybe could have been fixed. It is possible that future iterations of the course, if taught by Morii, will have better materials because they will have exams from this year to use. P\u2013sets were also a bit weird and sometimes a little niche, but they were not as grueling as I have found for other physics classes, and office hours were extremely helpful. Lectures were effective, if occasionally moving a little fast, and the lecture notes provided were pretty thorough. Labs were definitely a substantial time commitment, but I found them to be far more enjoyable than in previous 15\u2013series classes. The teaching staff cares a lot, which really made a difference.

In this class, you will continue to develop and strengthen oral and written competence, as well as reading and comprehension skills, building your vocabulary and learning the grammar points necessary for more analytical conversations (using hypotheticals, the conditional, the subjunctive, and indirect discourse). Specifically, you will be able to: describe and narrate simple events in the past and in the future, make comparisons, express opinions and possibilities, and engage in discussions. You will explore six targeted urban areas in Italy while discussing cultural topics, telling stories about travel, and engaging with Italian literature, cinema, music, and pop culture. In the second half of the semester, you will watch an award-winning movie, La meglio giovent\u00f9, that will provide ample opportunities to discuss the history of modern Italy and to learn more about Italian politics and contemporary issues. Course work will include individual and in group presentations and short creative writing and oral assignments, based on authentic texts and artifacts. In-class assignments will be supplemented with individualized conversations with native speakers of Italian to further enhance your understanding of the diversity of cultural perspectives within Italian communities.",

The aim will be to improve skills that are essential to the acting process, like concentration, focus, relaxation, observation, listening, collaboration and so on.

Additional sessions are spent examining current methods of antibiotic discovery and vaccine development.The course also introduces students to the wide diversity of pathogenic bacteria. Organisms discussed include pathogenic E. coli, Shigella species, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a discussion of the challenges presented by currently unculturable species.

Be sure to do the textbook reading! All of the midterm and half of the final exam is qualitative, drawing on pretty detailed recollections from the modules and textbook. The exams are pretty tricky, and I had a decently hard time with the final. It's hard to study for everything, but the teaching team's approach was to recommend looking over *everything.* This is, of course, hard to balance when you have a lot of qualitative and quantitative materials at the same time.

Many of the assignments use the skills you learned and then apply them to the outdoors so you can actually see your understanding of the topic come to fruition. The course derails sometimes into an environmental science and history course, but I personally enjoyed that, and it was fun to learn what Dr. Huth had to offer.

      "This is an interesting class, some really great aspects, some aspects not quite as good, but on the whole I would recommend.The class is split half and half into guest lectures and \"science\" lectures. The guest lectures are wonderful, and unto themselves make this class fully worthwhile to take. Really cool, interesting, passionate chefs with a lot to share. Including a tasty treat here and there. Just based on these guest lectures, this class is incredible.Now, the other half of the class is \"science\" lectures, and this is the aspect that I feel is most lacking. It basically feels like a high school science class. Very formulaic, not very well connected with the guest lectures. Abstractly the \"science\" they teach you is motivated by the lectures, but it is not science that will in any significant way help you cook better. Perhaps this is a necessary sacrifice to be able to offer this as a gened, but I personally got very little out of the \"science\" lectures. Admittedly I do have a science background, but I think even so, this statement stands.The labs were ok \u2013\u2013 often quite tasty, but also often fairly disconnected from the actual class. The guest lecturers would share so much interesting information, offer a demonstration or two, and then it would be disappointing to almost entirely ignore what they shared when we went to lab. The assignments were generally fine, though often there would be some mediocrely written questions that would somehow find their way through. ie questions that were not actually solvable given the material taught in the class, or that were ambiguously formulated in a way that didn't really suggest a way to solve. However, while this was a nuisance at times, it was nothing too unbearable. I think the qualm I shared generally do make the course less stressful than it would otherwise be, which may be an advantage in that regards, and so if you solely take this course for the guest lectures you will be well served! But I don't think I would recommend taking this class solely for its \"science\" lectures. Nonetheless, on the whole, very fun class, very cool experience.",
      "This class is decent. The guest lectures are genuinely amazing \u2014 it's so cool to see the chefs come in and they do live demos which are really interesting. They also have unique thoughts on cooking and the restaurant industry. The professor\u2013led lectures are not fun. There are demos, but they don't make it worth it, and the professors aren't that great at lecturing.",

What diagnoses were they making? What treatments did they offer? How did they understand human anatomy and physiology?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A millennium later, the Hippocratic physicians emerged on the Aegean Island of Cos.\u00a0 These physicians left us carefully stated surgical principles based, at least partly, on observation and measurement.\u00a0\u00a0Why did they record their wisdom in the form of aphorisms? At around the same time, Shushruta, in what is now India, appears to have offered surprisingly modern surgical care to his patients.\u00a0 Who was he?\u00a0 \u00a0In the second century CE Galen of Pergamum bursts on to the scene, intending to restore Hippocratic orthodoxy. Why was surgical thinking for nearly two millennia dominated by this his, often erroneous, teaching?\u00a0 The Islamic Golden Age, an explosion of scientific and medical discovery, is a key to our understanding of all that follows in surgical history.\u00a0 Why is this period overlooked today? How did the exposure of Galen\u2019s anatomical imprecision by Vesalius in 1543 and his absurd physiology by Harvey in 1628 begin a Medical Enlightenment?\u00a0\u00a0Why did it take until the 19th century for surgeons solve the riddles of anesthesia and antisepsis?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What were the roles of surgeons in the Eugenics movement and the Holocaust?\u00a0 Is the advice of the Hippocratic physicians that \u201cTo understand surgery one must go to war\u201d true in the 21st Century?Our study will examine these questions and many more.\u00a0\u00a0We will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia and explore the human body in the anatomy lab at Harvard Medical School.

      "Take this course if you're interested in history/humanities and medicine at all! I think this course is great for those who even have a slight interest in these fields, but I will say, that this course made me realize that I am not interested in humanities. Although the surgical aspects were interesting, I felt uninterested in many of the readings, especially the earlier ones. If you're not interested in humanities or history at all, I wouldn't recommend this course, but if you are, and are considering pre\u2013med or simply have an interest in medicine, I definitely would recommend this seminar. Most of the readings aren't bad, but some can be like 20+ pages. I don't recommend skipping out on the readings as without reading, you won't be able to participate in discussion and it feels so awkward while a few of the students who actually did the reading are speaking and engaging in discussion with the professor while you are silent and don't have anything to add. I do recommend skimming most of the readings, especially if they're long. As long as you have a general idea of the subjects, you'll be able to add to the discussion, so skimming is fine in my personal opinion. I know other students who went overboard and read everything and took notes, but I didn't do all of that and was still able to participate. I would say try to do the readings a day or two before class so you don't forget the topics on the day of class. You can also take notes during the readings, but I didn't. The papers are not bad (the first one is a 5\u2013paragraph essay and the second is a 3\u20135 page double\u2013spaced essay + presentation) and Dr. Milham provides useful feedback on your writing. I really enjoyed the field trips we went on to Countway Library and Harvard Medical School's anatomy lab.  Honestly, as long as you pay attention in this course and skim the readings, you'll be fine. This is essentially a very low\u2013commitment seminar with fun field trips and a great professor!",

(if you haven't you should be able to pick it up very easily as well). in terms of workload, the class is super light with only like 4 psets (and one is dropped lmao), a midterm, and a final project. the content isn't super hard and i think the algorithms are presented in a way that are pretty intuitive, but this class is still worth your time because it's just a good way to practice your stat and cs skills in a pretty chill way (you have a lot of freedom on the final project and most grad students just do a project related to their research)",

So many people will never learn all that we learned in the course of the semester, and I feel as though they should. Professor Williams is an amazing lecturer and he's so engaging. He's also funny and extremely passionate about the work he does. I'm so glad I took this class. The workload was way more than manageable. Your only assignments are really the three book reports due throughout the course of the semester which are only four pages long and really chill. I'm extremely glad that I took this course freshman year. In classes like these, it is easy to feel hopeless and stuck as it seems like the heartbreaking issues we learn about can't simply be fixed by us. However, Professor Williams would usually end lectures with positive statements about what we CAN do and inspiring stories from successful reform initiatives."

      "An amazing class, taught by none other than Prof. Mojtaba Ebrahimian, an excellent and incredibly kind teacher. I went into this course with prior knowledge of the script and elementary Persian vocab/terms, so this class took roughly 2 hours out of my typical work\u2013week. I assume it would be a steep learning curve and relatively fast\u2013paced at the beginning of the semester (approx. 6\u201310 hours a week) for complete beginners to Persian, but Prof. Ebrahimian did an excellent job engaging with students through pop culture references, interesting personal anecdotes to augment our lessons, and constantly reviewing and reinforcing key concepts in class with patience and encouragement.  This course, according to Prof. Ebrahimian, goes at roughly twice the pace of a typical American college curriculum for introductory Persian, but don't be discouraged; it is structured incredibly well and graded very fairly.  You will be surrounded by students from all backgrounds and stages of education\u2013\u2013from scholars at the Divinity School to undecided freshmen and physics PhD candidates\u2013\u2013and you will emerge at the end of the semester with an eagerness and preparedness to continue studying Persian, as well as a far deeper appreciation for Persianate studies. Prof. Ebrahimian is such an experienced and talented instructor, and it's a shame that Harvard treats its preceptors so disrespectfully\u2013\u2013he was very well\u2013liked and respected among all students in the class, but Harvard administrators abruptly terminated his contract for flimsy reasons (yes, Harvard's preceptor contracts basically allow at\u2013will termination after their third year) and he had no other choice than to find a different job which resulted in him leaving in the middle of the semester. A substitute preceptor, Masoud Ariankhoo, took over from November until the end of the semester, and like Prof. Ebrahimian, he was an incredible language instructor with deeply insightful methods for language acquisition and an unmatched patience for our class, especially given the unfortunate and chaotic circumstances surrounding his rushed employment and the responsibilities he had to shoulder. To future readers of this QGuide, I can guarantee that your preceptor will be an amazing instructor who, like Profs. Ebrahimian and Ariankhoo, will stir your love for this beautiful language and more than adequately prepare you for future studies in Persian. I only hope that Harvard will treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve. I enrolled in this class in my very last semester as a college student because I had promised myself I would take full advantage of the exploratory opportunities offered by a liberal arts education, and I had wanted to study Persian since high school but never found the time to actually take it until the very last moment. This was by far the most enjoyable class I took this semester; I am so, so lucky I made the right decision of taking it.",

But the lucky thing is that it's consistently the same amount of work (a little more when you have the group projects, which are assigned in random teams so be prepared for this) for each week of the course, which makes it easy to budget how much time you will need to spend on it. Having the class be over once reading period starts was also great as it allowed me to balance out my schedule. The material in this class is sometimes hard to work with or understand, but the quizzes test much more fundamental material which you can get the hang of through practice problems. I definitely recommend studying for the quiz at least two days before, but much more than that is probably not necessary. Overall, a great way to fulfill a requirement for AM or just your interest.",
      "Hello, read this:The class suffers from a professor who cannot effectively teach and disseminate the course content. I believe this is because she is new to teaching. Although incredibly qualified and intelligent, she lacks the personability of professors who want to form rapport with their students and care about their learning. Often, she dismisses students with questions, or she almost acts offended that one has such a question. \u2013 AMPL is an awful coding environment/language around which to center this course. It should be Python. At the beginning of the class, no one, even the TFs, knew how to work AMPL properly. Often, there would be errors in the program, and the TFs would have no idea how to offer solutions.\u2013 Some readings had an egregious amount of errors. One reading had a mistake that was quizzed on! Why are we reading, learning, and taking notes on readings that have errors, and then quizzed on them? \u2013 The extreme optimization assignments are a waste of time.",

      "LISTEN TO ME! This course is NOT a gem, or easy, or anything like that. On the contrary, this course requires a stupendous amount of work, both in the classroom and out. This is a very conceptually difficult class because of how new/different the material is (most people have never studied something like this before) as well as the volume of material that is taught on (CelNav is a very complex discipline with many moving parts). In the beginning of the semester I thought that the Tuesday night labs (19\u20132200) were going to be relatively easy but as the semester progressed, they became a significant drain on both my time to complete other assignments as well as my sleep schedule. The star/sun journal that they make you keep is also extremely time consuming. The P\u2013Sets can be nightmarish, depending on how well you know the material. Why you should take this course is because you will never get another chance to do celestial navigation again in your life. My advice would be take this class pass\u2013fail, make every use of office hours (which they are very generous with), and use this class to satisfy your QRD requirement. The professor and the teaching staff are extremely personable and likable people who love students.Take the class, but don't let anyone say that it wasn\u2019t work. The only difference is that this is work worth doing. Also, Max, you are always in our hearts. Gone, never forgotten",

As part of the Warren Center\u2019s faculty fellowship, participants will read new and often unpublished research on labor and working-class life and debate histories and theories of such topics as social reproduction, finance and money, unemployment and informal markets, the environment and the care economy, migration, gender and racism, and the welfare state. In addition to discussing original research, students will also engage with classic and recent cutting-edge labor histories that explore proletarianization, industrialization, deindustrialization, and class formation from the colonial period to the present with an eye towards their transnational dimensions. Students will be guided to write a research paper on any aspect of American labor history.Students must complete both terms of this course (Part A & B) in the same academic year to receive credit.",

      "This class is awesome. If you are at all interested in protecting nature or law, this class is a must. It's one of the most creative courses I've taken at Harvard. It was awesome to not only learn from the professors but other law students themselves. Professors Lepore and Salzman are great, and they cover super interesting yet complimentary content. I was always super engaged in lecture and looked forward to it every week. The course does have a decent workload \u2013\u2013 readings can be long, and there are substantive assignments throughout the semester. But it was nothing unmanageable. The professors make themselves really accessible to their students. The class definitely had some hiccups, mostly because it's a new class. But even with the hiccups, this class is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard (and I'm a senior). Highly recommend.",
      "This class was amazing from a conceptual standpoint. I loved the content we were learning, and it was an amazing thought experiment. That being said, it was run quite badly. The assignments were never explained, and I often found myself confused. Take this class because of the amazing content, but be aware of the chaos that comes with it.",

      "This class was much better than I expected honestly. Lectures were very interesting and Prof Cikara was super super knowledgeable on everything she spoke about, she made the class feel engaging, and she always helped us feel like we were doing well.Lab (section) was extremely helpful because we were able to work on our final projects during that time which saved our group time outside of regular class hours. Also, having the TF answer our questions immediately during lab helped save time with troubleshooting. We also learned how to use Qualtrics and reviewed R basics which definitely assisted with the final project.Readings were interesting but honestly should be skimmed because we only really use them during lecture and for the Slack discussion posts. Also, during lectures, Prof. Cikara always mentions the key takeaways and quotes from each reading so that\u2019s useful.The final project was so fun if you have a good group. Make sure to have fun with your topic. As someone who did a survey instead of in\u2013person trials, it is much easier to set up in the long run. Make sure to test your qualtrics survey MULTIPLE times before publishing it. Also, communicate well with your group and don\u2019t let anyone take control.The assignments were really chill since they were graded based on completion, but make sure to do them to your best extent because I got all my feedback early on and by the time my draft was due, I didn\u2019t need any more revisions before the final project. It saves you time during reading period and finals to avoid having to write most of the paper if you have it done already.Lastly, the exam was good if you payed attention to the prerecorded videos or during in person lecture. I took notes during lecture in person and didn\u2019t watch the videos and got a good score. I wasn\u2019t stressing like the people that skipped lecture most days",

It is in the midst of the most extraordinary economic transformation the world has seen. This development comes on top of the political, social, and cultural revolutions of the 20th century. All these changes occur against a deep historical background still much in evidence.This course explores how the world's largest and oldest bureaucratic state has dealt with enduring problems of economic and political organization. It will show how even modern answers to these challenges bear the imprint of China's history.\u00a0 We will explore intellectual and religious trends, material and political culture, the tension between local society and the center, art and literature, and China\u2019s multiple economic and political transformations.\u00a0The consequences of the ancient Chinese political ideal of a single, civilized world empire is a central theme of the course, both from the comparative perspective of other multi-ethnic empires and in terms of the ever-broadening scope and intensity of China\u2019s global connections.\u00a0 We will draw comparisons with Rome between the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE; with Romanov and Soviet realms in the 17th century and 20th centuries, respectively; and with Western global empires of the age of high imperialism in 19th and 20th centuries.\u00a0 All these empires have come and gone, while a unitary, multi-national, Chinese empire has endured.On one hand, this has been a history of conflict, in which Chinese empires used military force to control the peoples on their borders. When they failed, border peoples incorporated China into their own inland empires: the Mongols in the 13th century and Manchus in the 17th.\u00a0 On the other hand, it has been a history of economic and cultural relations, in which China absorbed foreign models (Buddhism from India in the 3rd century; the sovereign nation-state system from the West in the 19th century; and both industrial capitalism and Stalinist socialism in the 20th century),\u00a0 defended trade by land along the Eurasian silk routes and by sea with South and Southeast Asia, and put itself forward as a model state for others in East Asia and beyond.The course will enable students to debate how the choices China has made in the past bear on the challenges it faces today, when a modern \u201cChina model,\u201d with ancient roots, competes with the United States for global leadership.The course is taught with multiple pedagogies.\u00a0 By shifting lecture to on-line modules that include \u201cfield trips\u201d to sites in China, class time is focused on active, participant-centered learning around major texts, works of art, and contemporary case studies.\u00a0\u00a0 Class preparation and attendance are mandatory.\u00a0 Assignments include responses to online modules, weekly sections, a midterm examination, and a final group project.",

    "course_description": "Why study monsters? \u00a0Though modern peoples don\u2019t fear monsters and indeed don\u2019t even believe in them (or so we tell ourselves), monsters have nonetheless done an awfully good job of colonizing twenty-first-century popular culture. At present marauding vampires and the walking dead are everywhere (and then, too, there are the internet trolls). Our world seems to dedicate a lot of energy to exactly the fears we thought we were supposed either to have exorcised by becoming modern and disenchanted or to have exorcised simply by growing up and no longer needing to look under our beds before falling asleep at night. Why does the monstrous compel us?\u00a0To help explain the fascination with the monster, this course looks backward, to nineteenth-century Gothic fiction and to the horror cinema that took up its mantle. The course\u2019s premise is that by taking seriously monsters\u2019 staying power we can learn a lot--about, for instance, the way the horror tradition has helped modernity make sense of itself. Monster stories are stories about the failures built into our systems of categorization and notions of normality. They make vivid the potential for violence in the notions of cultural purity and cultural inheritance that modernity uses to organize its accounts of identity and community.\u00a0We\u2019ll begin in the year 1818 with Mary Shelley\u2019s\u00a0Frankenstein. Our next move will be to the fictions that were written in the shadow of that famous ghost-story competition that on a dark and stormy night ushered into being both Shelley\u2019s monster and (via the poet Lord Byron and his traveling companion John Polidori) the first modern vampire. \u00a0Pursuit of this project will have us reading novels, novellas, and short stories by Sheridan Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Robert Louis Stevenson, Gaston Leroux, H.G. Wells, and others. We\u2019ll turn briefly near the end of the semester to the early horror films that gave the Gothic tradition\u2019s recurring preoccupations with the animation of the dead a new lease on life. Bringing the story of the class up to the present, we\u2019ll conclude the semester\u00a0with some episodes of Ben Stiller\u2019s Apple TV show\u00a0Severance.",

We read these works through a late-medieval Aristotelian understanding of the imagination as a fundamental but fallible instrument of human perception, observing how they respond to traditions of writing about dreams, visions, and journeys to heaven or hell that go back to classical and Christian antiquity, in which human cognition and the shape of the cosmos are thought about very differently. We consider the inter-relationship between the poetic and the visionary in light of the categories of orthodoxy\u00a0and discretion of spirits, at a period when both were fiercely contested. We also consider visionary writing and the contradictory claims it makes for the truth of intense imaginative experience as a precursor of the ubiquitous but puzzling modern concept of fiction, with special early reference to W. G. Sebald's 2001 novel Austerlitz. Texts not written in English will be read mainly in translation; no previous knowledge of Middle English, or of medieval visionary writing, is required.",

The goal of this course is twofold: first, to familiarize the students with the variety of attested reading traditions and, second, to introduce them to the periodization of Biblical Hebrew. In each case we will read portions of texts to better grasp the main linguistic differences between reading traditions and between chronolects, and to understand the interpretative implications of such differences. We will begin with a detailed and advanced study of the Tiberian reading tradition, whose basic features the students already know. We will then explore the less known, yet prestigious, Babylonian reading tradition, which we will compare to the more familiar Tiberian one. Finally, the students will be introduced to the so-called popular reading traditions, that is the Palestinian reading tradition and the transliterations of portions of texts and words of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (e.g., Origen\u2019s Secunda\u00a0and those found in the Septuagint) and into Latin (e.g., Jerome). To conclude our study of reading traditions, we will study the Samaritan reading tradition and read portions of the Samaritan Pentateuch. With regards to periodization and linguistic diachrony, the students will be introduced to the distinctive features (mostly syntactic and semantic) of the three main chronolects of Biblical Hebrew and their respective textual corpora: Classical Biblical Hebrew (pre-exilic); Transitional Biblical Hebrew (exilic); Late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic). Epigraphic Hebrew and textual criticism will help illustrate how chronolects can be further assessed.",

This course is very very new in the department so it's still working out some course logistics, but I'm confident the subsequent versions of this course will be strong. Robert is a highly approachable professor, and genuinely enjoys teaching this content. Assignments and projects definitely required time and effort, but were very manageable. A great addition to the linguistics department, and a great choice for anyone interested in these concepts. That being said, the class is pretty introductory, so if you have an extensive background in these concepts, some of the content might feel rudimentary or repetitive. However, the course does provide additional depth to these topics, so maybe talk to Robert first to figure out if this course is right for you. But if you're someone who already enjoys sociolinguistics and dabbles in learning about this for fun, you'll definitely enjoy this course even if it covers something you already know.",

      "This class was not a good experience. Do keep in mind that this course probably won't be with Chris and Gu again in the near future, so my words probably don't have much bearing on what your experience will be like. But yeah, this was a huge slog, and we did not learn very much at all. My chief complaint about this class is that we did not use any of the skills we have built up in our engineering classes to complete this project. I know there aren't many serious problems you could solve using two years of college education, but really, I believe the only requirement for this class is Expos 20. You did not need to have taken a single engineering class to do this project. Chris and Gu were very upfront early on about how an actual physical product would likely be outside the scope of the class they designed, like that was not a serious problem with the class! On our very first day, they showed us some of the past projects that previous years have worked on, to help generate excitement. It's ironic that all of these past examples were cool robots solving a smaller scale problem. Chris and Gu know that this is what we are here to do! Please make sure that we can!Anyway, you have to take this class, so I should offer some advice rather than just complain. If/when you get the opportunity to speak to experts in the field you are working on, take every one that you get. It will be the most helpful thing for your project by a mile. Aggressively hunt for interviews early on, these will give you real direction for your project, and offer some perspective that you can't just get on google scholar. Honestly, I would be saying much better things about my time in this class if I had done more of this early on \u2013 for future instructors, please note that this is the absolute most helpful thing for the students, and you should ensure that at least 3 expert interviews are conducted by each team. I would also avoid being in a group with your closest friends \u2013 you will work a lot harder that way.",

      "This is a great class for learning things you don't get anywhere else in the Harvard physics curriculum. You get to learn how to use lab equipment for a bunch of really neat experiments, and honestly it's pretty fun. I would strongly recommend it to other physics concentrators, although that's probably not that relevant since you have to take it anyways for honors. That said, even if you don't need this class, I think it teaches really valuable lab and writing skills.Now, the warnings... You need a good lab partner, and not necessarily your best friend\u2013\u2013\u2013you need someone who will do work. Also, it is a big time commitment. Tu/Th, 1:30 to 5:30, but often you need to stay until 6 to finish a measurement, not to mention the writing and planning you need to do outside of class. Don't expect to get good grades on the first try, either; you will have to do revisions for all of your papers to fix even very minor things to get an A. Is this annoying? Yes. Does it take a lot of time? Sometimes. Is it reasonable? Yes\u2013\u2013\u2013it makes you a better writer. The point is, some weeks you will probably be spending around 20 hours working on this class. With an awesome lab partner, maybe less. With a crappy lab partner, definitely more.Go in excited about the experiments. It's a really fun, really useful, and really unique class in the physics department. Good luck!",

The class had a policy where if an assignment is expected to take 120 minutes, then you were expected to not go over that limit too much. You could turn in your potentially partially finished assignment and get full credit. The main thing was to put in effort. I personally felt way better about this class because of that and it made me work to understand the material better than to chase homework completion since completion wasn't the target, honest hard work was. The class is HEAVILY group based, so you must either join the class with a group of friends or make friends in the class to group up with. So, be prepared for that. You group can make or break your midterm and final projects. Most likely, you won't be able to change your project group after the midterm project since the class is so small and the other groups will be pretty calcified by then. So expect to do both projects with the same people. Learn each others' strengths, weaknesses, and schedules for the best cooperation. I had absolutely no time to prepare for the final project presentation, BUT my teammates pulled through hard. Then, when they had their exams, I was the one who had nothing to do and I tried to carry the team then. Play to your strengths and schedules! The pre\u2013session assignments and readings are CRITICAL for being able to implement the midterm and final projects, so you should be VERY FAMILIAR with those and don't half ass it. This is where the leniancy of the class comes back to bite you. I still don't know Backprojection and 3D point mapping well and that meant that in the final project, I was useless for part of it. This should not be you. Learn it well. This class is extremely applied in terms of linear algebra. Know transposition, inversion and its properties, Singular value decomposition, matrix equations as linear system of equations etc. Beyond that, I would argue you should have an INTUITIVE understanding of what effect a matrix has in terms of its effect on a vector. Perhaps the 3Blue1Brown Linear algebra series will help. Consider reading up on projective geometry for extra prep. Get familiar with openCV and numpy and you'll thank yourself. Since I had experience with them, the class was made significantly easier. Learn to use chatGPT well since it is allowed and even encouraged in class. Overall, not much to say about the class. It was an easier class compared to Stat 111, CS181, 263. It wasn't a gem per se, but it was certainly not a hard class. It had its moments of being the hardest things on my plate and it had weeks where I just didn't do much for it. All by design of the class I think. A very doable class and a very gentle but firm introduction to computer vision, the less talked about cousin of AI/ML applications. Best of Luck!",

The class will facilitate contemporary discussions of cultural and political articulations of Latinidad. We will focus on key historical national and transhemispheric movements and events that have shaped the history of Latinx communities in the US such as \u2018El Movimiento\u2019 [Chicano Movement], the influx of Central American migration after prolonged civil wars and military interventions on the region, or the impact of NAFTA on the border. Given that Latinx creators often blur the boundaries of traditional literary, artistic, and scholarly genres, students will be working with works by diverse foundational figures which includes Afro-Nuyorican author Piri Thomas, queer Chicana multidisciplinary writer Gloria Anzald\u00faa and contemporary visual artists such as Firelei B\u00e1ez and Guadalupe Maravilla. Topics addressed in the course will include: the history of U.S. imperialism in Latin America, transnational migration and the U.S.-Mexico border, the colonial legacies of anti-blackness, Latina feminism(s), or critical Latinx Indigeneities.

In the case of each book, the text will be studied historically\u2013 \u201cexcavated\u201d for its sources and roots, and its subsequent development over the centuries\u2014and holistically, as a canonical document in Jewish tradition. Class time will be devoted primarily to learning to read the primary sources in translation; supplementary secondary readings will provide historical and cultural context. The seminar will also include regular visits to Houghton Library to look at manuscripts, early printed editions, and facsimiles of these books in order to study the changing shapes these books have taken as a key to understanding how they were studied and used, and to consider the relationship of materiality to textuality. While each book will raise its own set of issues, we will repeatedly deal with three basic questions: What makes a \u201cJewish\u201d text? How do these books represent different aspects of Jewish identity? What can these books tell us about the canonical books of other religious traditions? No previous background in either Judaism or Jewish history is required. All readings in English translation.

    "course_description": "It is unquestionably hopeful to imagine a world in which AI can help cure diseases, solve the disasters wrought by climate change, and wipe out age-old inequalities. It is also clear that the power of AI today is at an inflection point. The rise of deep learning architectures like the Transformer has yielded models capable of an array of impressive tasks, from seamless human-like conversation to composing symphonies. While these advances incorporate specialized machine learning models, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) present a broad array of possibilities. LLMs have surprised the scientific community and even their creators by exhibiting emergent abilities once thought to be uniquely human, such as fairly advanced cognition and reasoning, although the full extent of these accomplishments is debated. Yet, despite this excitement, substantive efforts at testing the cognitive and social abilities of general-purpose AI models is in its early stages. The technology behind ChatGPT, for example, while impressive, is not without problems, and even dangers. Research has shown that these models can amplify patterns of bias in their training corpus. While capable of passing standardized tests in varied domains, these models are strikingly poor at solving mathematical problems and transformers are more generally less successful in solving problems external to their training data. Despite these shortfalls, the promise of this technology \u2013 still in its infancy \u2013 is enormous. Because \u201c[t]he purpose of science is to develop, without prejudice or preconception of any kind, a knowledge of the facts, the laws, and the processes of nature\u201d we will apply this commitment to understanding the cognitive and social features revealed in ongoing discoveries (i.e., unpublished research) about LLMs by the participants in the course.\u00a0 \u00a0This course is geared towards graduate students (and some qualified undergraduates) from various disciplines, especially psychology, computer science and related fields. Students will present their ongoing research to the class and as such, this course is only for students already engaged in research on the cognitive and social aspects of LLMs. This course will be organized like a lab meeting, with the weekly topics being constructed out of the projects of the participating students. The hope is that in this moment of rapid testing and learning, students will benefit from learning about the challenges each confronts and the advances each is making, to reduce the problem of each student reinventing the wheel.",

Populated by a range and variety of digital prostheses that extends the mind-body-machine couplings in directions that are surprising and novel - wearables that track brain activity to assist in achieving advanced meditative states, using neurofeedback mechanisms to sync the emotional states of different people, curated psychedelic tourism that adjusts the design of the environment to induce a mystical experience, AI digital twins that track your biomarkers, stress levels and google calendars to help one create a sense of peak performance via a sense of primal detachment \u2013 this world of spirit tech does the most to reveal the future shapes of spirituality, and perhaps even religion. With the massive rise of people who identify as nones and \u2018spiritual but not religious\u2019 as well as the overwhelming malaise amongst younger people, engineered spirituality might become widespread sooner than we realize. This course will provide students with front-row seating to this nascent new world through a combination of a conceptual reading of some primary analytical and philosophical texts to understand this world of spirit tech as well as a series of case studies from the biotech, longevity, and wellbeing industry that aim to concretely realize some of these ideas.",

The second is that factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical forces, help explain why some groups experience unequal conditions that ultimately drive health inequality. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive to the environments that we inhabit.

      "MCB 197 is a brand new course related to gene regulation taught by Professor Amanda Whipple, an expert in the field of gene editing and CRISPR/ASO Therapeutics. As a whole, MCB 197 is likely one of the best classes I have taken thus far at Harvard, especially as it relates to my interests as an MCB concentrator. Given how it was the first year that the course was being taught, I was extremely impressed by how organized the class was, and how receptive Professor Whipple was to feedback.In terms of changes, the main area where MCB 197 can be improved would be the Problem Sets. As opposed to having quizzes/exams, the class incorporates 3 Problem Sets which constitute 30% of your total grade within the class (10%/PSET). At the start of the term, it was made very clear that no collaboration was allowed on the PSETs. However, while this would normally not be an issue as long as students attend Office Hours, MCB 197 was set up in a way where the TF\u2019s were unwilling and unable to provide concrete support when it came to questions on the PSETs. It got to the point where we were individually warned to not ask anything specifically related to a Problem Set question, and to instead focus on more broad and large\u2013scale topics. This resulted in Office Hours seemingly like a complete waste of time and a continuous search for answers and help that never came.Next, the course also introduced something called \u201cBreakout Sessions\u201d which were short assignments done within the last 15 minutes of class, both as a way of applying our newly learned knowledge and as a way of tracking attendance. However, the setup of these assignments were very inconsistent and they went from being included in almost every class to suddenly being completely gone once we got deeper into the course. Additionally, while we were initially told that Breakout Sessions were solely meant to be a form of practice (meaning that we just had to submit what we had by the end of class), they randomly changed them to be completion\u2013based and required students to finish the sections we couldn\u2019t do in class as homework. During weeks where we had PSETs, this timing made the Breakout Sessions very inconvenient and stressful.Lastly, at the end of the course, students are provided the opportunity to choose a disease and engineer a \u201ccure\u201d using a therapeutic we discussed in class. While this is a very interesting concept, the actual application of the project came relatively rough. At the start, students are asked to turn in a Project Proposal and receive feedback. Less than a week later, students are expected to provide a Revised Proposal, where they narrow down their topic choice and provide a slightly more detailed plan. Then, a week and a half after the Revised Proposals, students are expected to turn in their Capstone Poster, which outlines their full project, disease, and cure. In reality, this timeline ended up being extremely inconvenient, as feedback for the proposals (especially the revised one) were not received until the weekend before the entire project was due. Additionally, there is an exponential increase in the content included in the Revised Proposals versus what is required from the Capstone Poster. Going forward, it is absolutely necessary for this timeline to be revisited and revised, as it makes it nearly impossible to complete the project in a timely and high\u2013quality manner.Overall, despite these minor issues, MCB 197 remained an outstanding course. Most of these are smaller issues that will improve with time, and can be linked back to it being the first year that the course is being offered. However, the willingness of Professor Whipple to accept (AND APPLY) feedback truly gives the class the extra boost, showing how the teaching staff truly care about the student experience. As a whole, MCB 197 remains the best course I\u2019ve taken thus far when it comes to content, and is a must\u2013take for any student interested in pursuing anything related to the field!",

The books are all interesting and add new facets to the singular experience of spiritual crisis. They also provide a reasonable amount of reading per week.There is really only so much you can do to prepare for or understand these fundamental spiritual questions, but this class will definitely make you wiser and more prepared to face them.I came in with a religious background (Christian) and I found that this class deepened my understanding of my own faith.  The class is structured in such a way that it is friendly regardless of your spiritual background.I think your experience in this class may depend on how much people are willing to participate. There will definitely be at least some people willing to add a lot to the discussion since this is a first year seminar, but I feel like my class could have been a bit more intimate than it was (some people seemed uncomfortable contributing the discussion often).Professor FitzGerald is a thoughtful moderator whose questions always raise the level of the discussion to a new level. If you put in the modest level of effort required, you will do well in the short assignments he gives. (Always make sure to capitalize the G in FitzGerald, though!)",

Today, less than half of young Americans view capitalism positively, and calls for alternatives are becoming ever more frequent. Why? And why have different forms of capitalism led to such unequal outcomes around the world? What is capitalism, really; what has it been, and what might it be? This course takes students on a journey to explore the past, present, and future of various forms of capitalisms, globally and beyond, introducing them to theories and frameworks to help make sense of the world in which they live, and where it might be headed.This seminar introduces students to the Socratic teaching method used in the Harvard Business School and is based on case studies covering the vast epic of capitalism. In addition to discussing the past, present, and future of global capitalism, the seminar will familiarize students with basic concepts of macroeconomics as well as tools, such as balance of payments analysis and national economic accounting to prepare them for lives of active global citizenship. The seminar will, at times, meet at Harvard Business School in order to make use of Baker Library\u2019s extraordinary collection of materials relating to the histories of business, capitalism, and political economy.",

Nevertheless, Jewish magic and folklore exhibit remarkable continuities over time, with various ideas and motifs spanning Jewish history from its ancient beginnings to the present.(2) Jewish magical and folkloric traditions sometimes stand at odds with monotheism, yet they draw so heavily on other aspects of Jewish religiosity (e.g., prayer, Torah study, mysticism, etc.) that it can be difficult to define magic and folklore in Jewish contexts.Specific topics to be covered in this course include demonic possession narratives from ancient Israel; nautical tall tales told by the rabbis of Sasanian Iraq; accounts of werewolves, witches, and vampires in Jewish writings from medieval Germany; Ladino ballads; Yiddish fairytales; and many others. This course is designed both for newcomers to the study of Judaism and for students with a background in Jewish studies who are interested in learning more about magic and folklore. No prior familiarity with Jewish studies or knowledge of Jewish languages is required. If any enrollees have the ability and desire to read magical texts and folk narratives in Hebrew/Aramaic, a special weekly section will be arranged for this purpose.",

      "Please, please, PLEASE take a class with Therese Lautua while you can. Although I will do absolutely everything in my power to get her a permanent position at Harvard, she is only here on a fellowship contract, so her time with us may be unfortunately limited. I believe that we have zero tenured faculty of Pacific descent at this university, but that is another issue.Taking a class with Therese will not only transform your approach to learning and discussion, but it will require you to engage deeply with some of the most pressing issues of our time from an indigenous Pacific lens. That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Talanoa, or to talk/unveil, refers to a collaborative discussion approach to complex problems. Through talanoa, we build community, challenge norms, and facilitate understanding. This class was taught using Talanoa, which means that each student must come to class prepared to fully immerse themselves in the week's texts and topic(s). It was an unparalleled learning experience, and one that enabled students to form genuine connections with both each other and the material. Around 85% of texts that we read in REL 32 were by indigenous Pacific scholars. In most classes about topics in the Pacific that I have come across (at Harvard), the ratio is flipped. I think that in itself speaks volumes. Having an emic perspective on Pacific issues is absolutely fundamental to effectively and deeply engaging with it.  I come from a country in the Pacific, and for lack of a better word, this class felt like home. It felt like home in a place that can sometimes feel isolating. This class gave me an anchor, and it (or any class taught by Therese, for that matter) will give you one too.",

More than anything, this sort of perspective will bring into view the magnitude of Indigenous power, resilience, and solidarity.

Unfolding across Afro-Eurasia, the Medieval Islamic Commercial Revolution wove together a world system of unprecedented reach and strength, as new trade networks extended across land and sea to join the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, North and Sub Saharan Africa, Central and South Asia, reaching all the way to China. As a result of this momentous development, technologies such as paper-making spread from East Asia all the way to Europe; new crops such as sugar, cotton, and citruses started being cultivated across Afro-Eurasia; new \u201cglobal\u201d tastes developed, with Chinese porcelain becoming a common product in the Middle East and European elites becoming accustomed to South Asia spices. Yet the social and economic dynamics of this \u2018globalization before globalization\u2019 remain poorly understood. In following the lives and business activities of merchants (Muslim and not) of the Islamic world through the primary sources that they themselves produced (their letters, accounts, books), we will ask how this great feat was achieved.

    "course_description": "Is today's global economy truly more advanced and complex than the systems that shaped the world in the ancient past?Requiring no prior knowledge of economics or ancient history, the aim of this course is to introduce students to the nature of global economic systems by looking at the complex and sophisticated nature of different types of economic enterprises in antiquity. In our modern global economies, different markets are internationally intertwined, as technological advances have allowed for swift communication and economic dependence between practically all areas of the world. The shipping industry might be a salient example of this, where one cargo ship got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021 and blocked the channel for six days, stranding ca. 400 vessels and delaying between $6 and $10 billion in trade per day, attesting to the importance of this trade route for the global economy. Yet, the use of this route for large scale long-distance sea voyages can be traced back at least to the Roman period, where there is evidence of cargo ships traveling from Muziris, India to the Red Sea Coast of Egypt, carrying with them 635 tonnes of cargo meant to travel all the way to Alexandria and Rome, and worth around 7 million Roman sesterces, the equivalent of the salary of seven senators at the time. In this case the ancient and the modern don\u2019t seem so different.By analyzing the global connections of well-known ancient civilizations such as the Assyrian, Egyptian, Macedonian, Roman, and Palmyrene Empires, students will learn to see similarities to our own current global economic enterprises and learn not only of the challenges but also the social injustices and exploitation that take place in these global enterprises. Another particularly poignant example is the week where we study ancient global pandemics, seeing the ways in which they affected the labor force, the lower classes, agricultural production, and even politics, much like during our recent COVID-19 pandemic.Furthermore, students will learn how to dissect historical and analytical narratives that utilize quantitative and qualitative data sets through selected case studies spanning millennia between them. For example, the class covers the economic logistics of the military conquests of Alexander, the constructions of the pyramids of Old Kingdom Egypt, the economic and human price of urban development of the city of Rome, and the capital investment and merchant networks required for the long-distance trade along the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade routes.",

Self-translation\u00a0refers to the process through which authors translate their own writing into another language; such a translation may be undertaken at the same time as the original is composed or long after it is completed, but it always represents a self-reflexive relationship between the author and their own work. Because the self-translator has access to the original\u2019s authorial intentions, they are empowered to take creative liberties that a conventional translator might shy away from. Through these creative liberties, self-translators enrich the cultural capital of both their native and adopted language and culture. Self-translation, in this way, often involves writing oneself into world literature, creating cosmopolitan palimpsests that reveal, in their dialogue with diverse cultural traditions, the nonlinear forms of modernity. In this course, we will delve into case studies of self-translation from East Asia, East Africa, Latin America, North America, and Italy. We will also investigate the implications of self-transmediation, which occurs when an author adapts their own work into another medium, transporting that work from the page to the stage to the screen, for instance. For the final assignment, students will produce their own work of self-translation or transmediation.",

Through a combination of historical and contemporary readings, students will gain an understanding of the factors contributing to housing challenges, including a shrinking supply of affordable housing, inadequate wages and employment, discriminatory housing practices, and urban development. Students will also learn about how supply-side actors\u2014such as landlords, real estate brokers, and building code inspectors\u2014reproduce or exacerbate housing inequality; and why policy responses\u2014like housing choice vouchers, emergency shelters, and supportive housing programs\u2014do or do not seem to help.",

I really enjoyed the reading materials, they were all super different and mixed a lot of different methods / perspectives. It's also not too much work or reading at all which is great.

The course emphasizes the significance of African languages as instruments of thought, expressed through signs and sounds, in various domains such as constitution writing, food production, governance, religion, and environmental use/protection. Students will critically engage with the organic sociality of vernacular spaces, including church rooms, courtrooms, classrooms, hospital rooms, and entrepreneurial spaces, where African languages are linguistically accessible.Course Objectives:- Understand the role of language as an instrument of thought and communication in African societies.- Explore African languages as archives of knowledge and their importance in preserving cultural heritage.- Gain knowledge of AI technologies and their application in collecting and cataloguing African language archives.- Examine the significance of archival information sharing across different African languages.- Analyze the critical engagements that take place in vernacular spaces and their impact on African communities.- Understand the linguistic accessibility of African languages in various social contexts.",

Yet, we often fail to examine the implicit assumptions and approaches underlying our learning. In addition, we often overlook the importance of unlearning \u2013 the process of letting go of inaccurate information, misguided beliefs, harmful biases, limiting mindsets, and unproductive habits to make room for new learning. Unlearning has always been essential for replacing outdated and simplistic ideas with updated and sophisticated ones. Today, it has become even more critical due to contemporary challenges such as societal polarization and media echo chambers, the impact of generative AI and other technologies on traditional practices, the necessity for challenging the status quo to envision a more just society, and the urgent need for dialogue, understanding, and empathy in an increasingly tribalistic world.\u00a0Intentionally examining the purposes and processes of learning and unlearning will help us become more effective (un)learners, and ultimately, illuminate how these processes can foster human flourishing in our current world and for future generations.\u00a0In this course, we will engage with fundamental questions and debates, including:What does it mean to learn and unlearn? How do individuals prioritize the diverse purposes of learning, such as cultivating intellect, developing moral values, fostering personal growth, preparing for citizenship, and beyond? How do our experiences and cultural contexts influence our understanding of learning? How do we learn, and why do we learn in the ways that we do? When do we feel motivated or demotivated? How do schools nurture or stifle children\u2019s natural curiosity? Do students learn better through teachers\u2019 instruction or independent exploration? How do we monitor, evaluate, and adjust our own learning processes? How might generative AI be used to support or hinder learning? How do we decide what is worth learning and what should be unlearned? Why do we struggle to change our minds and habits, and what strategies can effectively facilitate this transformation?\u00a0We will examine the cognitive, metacognitive or self-reflective, emotional, social, and moral dimensions of learning and unlearning. We will use a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary lens, analyzing cases from East Asian and Western cultures and draw insights from psychology, neuroscience, education, and philosophy.\u00a0Class sessions are highly interactive and emphasize active learning. Students will engage in a range of activities including lectures, discussions, debates, case studies, interviews, group teaching exercise, storytelling, guest speaker sessions, and reflections on both personal learning processes and the pedagogical design of this course.\u00a0This course welcomes all students to enroll and requires no prerequisites.",

Having achieved independence from the Spanish crown, the newfangled republics were in dire need of a unifying discourse capable of weaving together history, identity, and political legitimacy. Each post-colonial state endeavored to articulate a coherent narrative that would cement its status as a nation, recognizable across the ages. The difficulties entailed in erecting such \u2018foundational fictions\u2019 were daunting, and Latin American historians, regardless of their ideology, drew on their ample literary skills to solve them. Their oeuvre, often epic in style and overwhelming in scholarship, offers a window into that nation-building era in which the boundaries between history and literature were still porous and undefined.This course serves as an introduction to 19th century Latin American historiography and its intimate but problematic relationship with literature. In analyzing these historical masterpieces, students will become acquainted with their virtues, shortcomings, and lasting impact while discovering the complicated history they portray.

    "course_description": "If one of the end-stations of modernism's grand narratives was Nazism, then the attempts to move beyond a fascist past in the decades following Germany's defeat in the Second World War represent a distinctly German mode of postmodernism. The social and political manifestations of this long postmodernism\u2014a divided Germany, the threat of nuclear war, the rise of the information age, the development of globalist identities and ecological awareness, a \"reunified\" Germany\u2014are characterized by enormous rupture, discontinuity, and instability. Literary forms in this period are no different: the death of the author, a growing discontent with the realist novel, and the relegation of literature to a subset of media are all symptoms of an age in which fiction has come to question its own legitimacy. By the same token, however, this period also witnesses exhilarating experimentation and groundbreaking formal shifts that continue to influence our notions of what is possible in literature up to the present day.This course surveys key contributions to the literary avant-garde in German-speaking postmodern contexts. We will study a range of prose fiction by major authors from West Germany, East Germany, postwar Austria, and a post-Wall Germany, including Thomas Bernhard, Uwe Johnson, Christa Wolf, Alexander Kluge, W.G. Sebald, Rainald Goetz, and Jenny Erpenbeck. The course will consider problems of authorship, the challenges to constructing subjecthood, the boundaries between the fictional and non-fictional, the influence of electronic media on prose forms, the relation of text to image, the response of fiction to market forces and historical trauma\u2014and how each of these topics contributes to our understanding of the often overused signifier \"postmodernism.\" This course will also examine a sample of key theoretical texts on the failure of modernism and whatever must come after it by Theodor W. Adorno, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, Audre Lorde, and Jean-Francois Lyotard.\u00a0Students will leave this seminar with a strong command of the ideas, styles, and provocations found in German literature from the end of World War II to the contemporary moment, as well as a clear idea of the debates and stakes at the heart of postmodernism in Western contexts.",

Cinema, by its very form, presents a world that is both present and absent, immersive yet untouchable, exposing the instability of meaning and the uncertainty of reality. Kierkegaard describes\u00a0angst as \u201cthe dizziness of freedom,\u201d while Heidegger sees it as a fundamental mood that reveals the \u201cgroundless ground\u201d of our human existence. Film does not merely depict these tensions\u2014it enacts them through its very form. Its aesthetic and structural choices manipulate time, space, and perspective, drawing the viewer into an experience where meaning and reality are unstable.We will analyze the work of seminal directors, including Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Andrei Tarkovsky, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Lars von Trier, Ari Aster, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, David Lynch, and Michael Haneke.

Is antisemitism an illness, or a symptom of a variety of maladies?\u00a0In this seminar, we will address these questions. We will do so by tracing Jew-hatred from antiquity to the present, in both Christian and Islamic lands.

Topics include the effects of friendship on physiological and mental health, the role of social emotions in strengthening group cohesion, and how environmental pressures \u2014 from resource scarcity to social upheaval \u2014 shape affiliative behavior. The course also investigates the role of technology in human sociality across deep time, from the earliest stone tools to AI-driven interactions, examining how innovations shape trust, cooperation, and the neurobiological systems that regulate social behavior. Weekly discussion sections provide an opportunity to engage more deeply with key readings, explore cross-cultural and interdisciplinary perspectives, and apply course concepts to contemporary debates on friendship and technology.

      "This is an amazing class, and you should definitely take it if you have any interest in how we have evolved to have friendships, or if you want to think more deeply and intentionally about your own friendships today. The science and engineering  divisional distribution requirement had me fearing the worst, especially as a gov and sociology major, but now, I am super grateful that exists, because it encouraged me to take this course that ordinarily, I would have thought of as not in my field and therefore something I couldn't handle. However, the way this course is taught, even those who don't do much in the way of evolutionary work will be just fine, and be able to engage fully with the material. The discussions about AI are especially fun throughout the course, and the readings always made me think. If you need any accommodations, as long as you communicate with the course staff about exactly what you need, they are flexible and will work with you. Finally, at least in the version of this course that I was in, we had a multiple choice quiz every few weeks, a research proposal where we were supposed to work with a bot to help design the research experiment. Then, we had one final project that comprised of a couple of different parts, including a creative component to highlight what we have learned throughout the semester. Other than the quizzes, which could sometimes be a bit stressful, all the assignments were a lot of fun, and really allowed us to explore this course. Overall a great class, and I definitely think you should take it for an amazing learning experience with an extremely supportive team.",

And granted, the teaching staff are overall a sweet group of people. However, the lectures in this course were absolutely bizarre, chock full of tangents and changes in direction. After every class I felt confused as to what the central topic of the lecture was, and what information was important for exams. The exams were also horrible and confusing in content (EX: exam 1 had a question on brain parts, despite the Professor telling us explicitly and repeatedly that we did not need to know it for the test). Where the class really shined was the final segment of the course, which centered on AI and Evolution. I left wishing that the entire course had been about that topic, as that was by far the most bearable part of the class.",

In every class, we will work with a wide array of primary sources, as well as secondary sources from the fields of history, economics, theology, psychology, and anthropology to address pressing contemporary questions: Is it ethical for education and healthcare to leave individuals with lifelong debt, and how should economic policies address this burden? What role should governments play in regulating commerce, administering credit and welfare, and redistributing wealth? Is capitalism inherently at odds with morality? How can businesses balance shareholder interests with ethical responsibilities? And, finally, how does the prism of moral economy illuminate ongoing issues on our own campus, such as Harvard\u2019s investment in fossil fuels?",

We will learn about major dance figures who passed through Boston\u2019s universities \u2013 among them the choreographers Gus Solomons Jr. (MIT) and Donald Byrd (Tufts), and the co-founder of New York City Ballet, Lincoln Kirstein (Harvard) \u2013 as well as how organizations such as the Institute of Contemporary Art have invited artists to test the boundaries of dance and visual arts. Further, we will examine how the city\u2019s LGBTQ+ communities and immigrant groups have used theatrical and social dancing to foster belonging and battle cultural exclusion.This is a seminar-style, discussion-based course. We will analyze a range of primary sources (dance films, photographs, reviews, interviews with artists, and more) and read essays by dance theorists as well as cultural histories of Boston to contextualize our observations and arguments. Additionally, we will meet with local artists and arts administrators and venture outside the classroom to see performances and historic sites. For the capstone final project, students will have the option to write an extended research paper or curate their own Boston dance festival. No prior experience with dance is necessary to enroll.",

The Colombian writer showed his deep knowledge of Morrison\u2019s novels and Morrison thanked him as a resource for religious themes in her writings. Later, in an interview with Professor Carrasco, Morrison stated, \u201cWhen I read his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, I literally said, \u201cOh, my God, you can do this\u201d\u2014meaning magic, strange stuff\u2014and be deadly serious. So, that freed me up in my writing. Reading him unlocked something important for me. \u201dThis course is a comparative and critical study of the religious dimensions in their writings and lives with special attention to the themes of religious experience, homeland and quests, Africa and Latin America, \"rememory\" and myths, goodness and the literary imagination. We engage with four types of \u201ctexts\u201d and link them together to decipher the ties between the writer\u2019s lives, countries, politics, liberation movements and their writings; autobiographical fragments, novels, film, critical reflections. For Morrison we will use the film \u201cToni Morrison: The Pieces I Am\u201d and interviews as autobiographical fragments. For Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez we will read his autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale\u00a0and interviews. Novels include Song of Solomon,\u00a0Beloved, Home, A Mercy, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Chronicle of a Death Foretold. This course will not be open to auditors.

It is meant to introduce students to ways of life that are informed by the most prominent sub-traditions of Hinduism today as they are reflected in the different versions of the Hindu calendar, also called Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45ga or Pa\u00f1jik\u0101. Building on the history of different Hindu calendars, which consist of lunar dates (tithis), this course aims to give a broad overview of Hindu religious life as it revolves around festivals, fasts, seasonal rituals and pilgrimages that comprise each version of the calendar. Students will begin this journey with the Lunar New Year of the Vikrama Sa\u1e41vat calendar, which coincides with the end of the Spring Festival of Nine Nights (Caitra Navar\u0101tri) dedicated to the feminine divine, \u015aakti. After exploring the many ways in which the same event is celebrated in different regions, students will progress through the calendar towards the end of the year, learning about other major Hindu festivals along the way. Because of the diversity of religious perspectives in the sub-traditions of Hinduism, often the same events on these lunar calendars are imbued with multiple meanings and celebrated in various ways, so this course will put a special emphasis on learning when and how religious events are tied to entirely different mythologies and theologies, and how that creates opportunities for pluralistic encounters. Furthermore, since not all traditions under the umbrella of 'Hinduism' agree on one New Year or one supreme deity, the course also delves into alternative New Year celebrations, the deities and mythologies honored by them, and the issues of caste reflected by them. Throughout the course, students will learn about the ways in which devotees structure their lives around sacred dates, such as the birthdays and anniversaries of their chosen deities of worship, as well as commemorations of other mythological events. In addition to this, they will gain a perspective on food, visual art, dance, and music as aspects of life regulated by the Hindu calendar. Finally, the course will highlight cross-religious experiences, as certain major festivals transcend religious boundaries and share a history with some non-Hindu festivals that coincide with them. Knowledge of Sanskrit, other South Asian languages, or prior background in South Asian religions is not required for this course. Jointly offered in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as SAS 108.",

The question of Robert E. Lee/Marcus Aurelius); the entanglement between working the land and enslavement and the parallels and divergences between Roman and New World enslavement; the influence of Roman landscape design and horticulture on later American landscapes and gardens; the legacy of Roman surveying methods and centuriation in the mapping of the US; imperialism and the construction of the Other (Neoclassical portrayals of Indigenous figures in civic spaces in the guise of ancient Mediterranean barbarians); the translation and adoption of ancient Mediterranean and Roman visual culture in American cemeteries (including a class visit to Mount Auburn Cemetery). \u00a0Class visits: Mount Auburn Cemetery (reached via public transportation) and the Harvard Map Collection.",

    "course_description": "The twentieth century produced numerous figures in Judaism and Christianity that developed ways of understanding religion in modernity that included the practical application of religious practice (piety) with activist engagement in the world (politics). This course will focus on two such figures; the Trappist monk Thomas Merton (d. 1969), and the Jewish theologian Martin Buber (d.1965). Merton excavated and taught the history of monasticism and Christian piety, living as a monk in the Gethsemane Monastery in Bardstown Kentucky, and became active in anti-Vietnam War politics until his untimely death from accidental electrocution in Bangkok in 1969. Buber was a leading philosopher/theologian and Zionist activist in Germany until his immigration to Mandate Palestine in the late 1930s and then became a voice of inspiration for humanistic Zionism, religious renewal, and the revival of Hasidism.This course will examine the writings and lives of both figures, paying close attention to their use of the past, theological worldviews, their understanding of a life of piety, and their commitment to political activism. They will serve as two exemplars of the ongoing attempt to reconsider, reconstruct, and revise religion in a changing world.",

This seminar allows students to explore the revolutionary advances in the study of the origins of American civilizations at the Olmec ceremonial centers (dated 1300-600 B.C.), and view hundreds of major new towns and cities just discovered in the Maya jungle (dating from 600 B.C.- 9 00 A.D.). Lidar imagery from Professor Fash's famed site of Copan and many others in Mexico and Guatemala will be analyzed by the students for evidence of hitherto unknown archaeological roads, ceremonial centers, towns, and cities. This technology has finally laid to rest the mistaken \"conclusion\" by earlier archaeologists that civilization and powerful cities \"could never have arisen first in the tropical forest.\"Students will also analyze objects from those cities during the seminar sessions, from the priceless collections of the Peabody Museum in class and on display in the 3rd and 4th floor galleries. There will also be a 'field trip' to Harvard\u2019s Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C. to see some of the most beautiful works of Olmec and Maya art ever created. The new discoveries of both Lidar and the decipherment of the Olmec and Maya writing systems make this is a transformative time in this highly visible field that students can explore for themselves through a variety of means via this seminar.This seminar will allow students to \u201clearn by doing,\u201d both with ceramics and other artifacts from the Peabody Museum\u2019s collections that we will be working with in the seminar room and the Mesoamerican Laboratory with Dr. Jenny Carballo, and also with digital images on-screen of Lidar imagery, and prints of selected 3D site maps.

This seminar draws on anthropological perspectives to examine critically what has come to be known as the \"replication crisis\" in health science. Framing the crisis both as a moment of danger and of radical possibility, together we will explore how debates over replication illuminate deeper questions regarding the nature, stakes, and commitments of health science and its objects of study, as mediated through themes of representation, causality, error, epistemic virtue, risk, uncertainty, and objectivity. In doing so, we will consider how scientific authority is constructed and contested; how the replication crisis affects public trust, lay participation, and broader engagements with health and science; and unexpected opportunities the crisis may present to advance the cause of health equity. Through ethnographic readings, case studies, and interdisciplinary scholarship, students will analyze the drivers of the crisis and consider its implications for the future of scientific knowledge-making and health care delivery.",

How can we understand what happened in Fiji? And, likewise, how did heaviness in the U.S. migrate from signifying prestige to stigmatizing? In this seminar, we will examine the bio-social dimensions of disordered eating and being overweight as well as the volatility of weight ideals and their enduring moral salience. We will draw from anthropological and clinical perspectives to explore the rapidly shifting landscape of body shape ideals in the U.S. over the last century, the arrival of eating disorders in the Global South, the medicalization of obesity, and the emergence of pervasive weight stigma\u2014as manifest in \u2018fat shaming\u2019 and even in policy interventions that have had unintended consequences. We will ask what the social structural determinants of obesity are, as well as how social adversities relating to the built environment, toxic food environment, climate change, and food deserts are embodied. We will examine variation in how the body is cultivated for self-presentation across diverse cultural contexts alongside evidence that the media have accelerated the globalization of thin ideals.\u00a0 We will conclude by considering both emerging threats inherent to pervasive social media platforms and digital photo-shopping as well as potential opportunities to reset social norms through social movements and policy.",

We will identify the roles personal idiosyncrasy and \u2018disfluency\u2019 can play in the pursuit of that neutrality, and the opportunities and challenges they present to the performer. We will investigate rudimentary components of story, uncovering along the way the most essential markers for perceiving story, emotion and thought in physical performance. We will explore the beginnings of creating character and story through gradual stages using both non-verbal and text-based story (solo body, body in relationship to object, bodies in interrelationship w/ each other). In the latter part of the semester, we will experiment with stylistic schools of physical performance, including mime, Blue Man Group, Charlie Oates sculpture work, clowning/acrobatics and Viewpoints, and will also investigate ensemble cohesion and material generation through games and improvisation.\u00a0Throughout the semester\u2019s explorations, we will also develop basic familiarity with simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument.\u00a0The class will be both rigorously physical and dialectical, will include several short solo and ensemble performance pieces throughout the semester and will culminate in both a full-ensemble long form piece, as well as short individual pieces.",

In fact, it marks the largest growth period in human development outside of infancy. Driven by enhanced thinking and reasoning capabilities, adolescents struggle with balancing their desires for autonomy andindependence with their desires for guidance and connection. These dynamics result in renegotiating family and social relationships and engagement in school, impact the effectiveness of educational practices, and enhance adolescents' ability to think and plan for their future. This course is designed to provide a practical understanding of the developmental issues, assets, and trajectories of adolescent thinking and reasoning. Based in classic and current theory and research and using real problems of practice, students will learn, integrate, and apply knowledge of biological and cognitive development and of identity processes. This course will prepare educational practitioners to integrate developmental approaches to their pedagogy and provide a foundation for those interested in applied research on adolescence.No prerequisites; prior course work in developmental psychology is helpful, but the course is designed for students without a psychology background. Recommended for students who are planning to work directly with adolescents or are planning to engage in applied research with adolescents.",

By obscuring the truth in false narratives, or by communicating truths through narrative and arational means, myth has been interpreted as hostile to freedom, liberalism, rationalism, and deliberative democracy. And yet, despite Max Weber\u2019s claim that the modern world had become \u2018disenchanted,\u2019 the last century saw an explosion of political myths implicitly and explicitly driving mass political movements. Political myth prompts key questions about political theory: Is it possible or even desirable to have a politics without myth? If not, then what role exactly does myth play in politics? Can political myths be open to contestation and reevaluation? Under what conditions can political myth be a means of oppression, and under what conditions can it serve emancipatory ends? To address these questions, this class will examine the relationship between myth and politics through a series of major theoretical statements drawn mostly from European intellectual history followed by a series of case studies.

      "I think this course is going to get reviews that it maybe doesn't quite deserve this year. This course absolutely suffered from \"this is the first semester it was taught\", and it was incredibly disorganized as a result, but it was my favorite course of the semester despite that. That said? The material is cool. It's very cool, I thought. We covered a wide range of topics, some I was familiar with and some I wasn't, and the crux of the class was basically \"here's this cool topic. Here are some cool applications. We'll give you the latitude to explore them\". The material provided in the course gave you ample opportunity to explore the topics you wanted to explore, and that was incredibly well done. I think the course also gave you the space to explore potential topics without fear of failure. For instance, our second project explored a topic that just didn't work. We thought it was a cool idea, maybe it would work, it didn't, and we explained why in the report and that was fine. The pacing on the course does feel a bit off, which I think will also be resolved with subsequent iterations of the class. We seemingly blitzed through all of the material in the first ~15 lectures, with very very large psets by merit of the large amount of topics we'd discussed, and then had, practically, nothing for the last 10 classes, which left very little time to deeply understand the material unless you decided to play around with the material in your project. The workload in this class is also a lot. More than you would hope for to have time to play with the concepts. Some of the section notebooks took upwards of 3 hours, the projects could reasonably be done with ~30\u201340 man hours, but there were 3 of them, and the psets were an absolute slog, mostly due to the software development component below. The software development component of the class misses the mark. I definitely understand why it's there \u2013 I think more and more we're using collab notebooks and code to solve interesting problems (demonstrated with the projects in this class), but the way it's integrated doesn't quite make sense. We had M/W lectures covering math topics, and a F lecture for software, but the software lecture wasn't tied into the math lectures, and the way these were combined was to just have the problem sets for the math component, but tack on \"write a test suite achieving x coverage on your tests, with robust python scripts\". So basically \"do the 115 problem set math, but then add all the parts of software development nobody likes, mostly because they take forever\", which wasn't particularly appetizing. I'm not sure how to do this better, but I also think this will be improved on.",
      "Don't take this class. It is incredibly disorganized and confusing. You're asked to do a lot of assignments that are confusing and time consuming. Class projects are kind of a mess and group work is always a bit stressful and annoying. Brenner is really engaged and excited about the material but the presentation style is quite disorganized and difficult to follow. The slides aren't very helpful for learning material and reference materials can be difficult to sort through since very long documents (sometimes like 70+ pages) are posted and it's unclear which parts of it are relevant. Becker teaches the software development component and the course basically is just two full classes combined into one making it quite overwhelming. Just don't take this class unless you want to be confused and overwhelmed with assignments.",

We will study questions such as: How do politicians distribute resources and promises to win over voters? When and why do citizens engage in ethnic voting? What is the value of descriptive representation in electoral politics? What factors influence the formation, success, and longevity of political parties? Students will engage with academic research which makes theoretical arguments and uses quantitative and qualitative methods to answer these questions in the context of developing countries.",

We will consider how Lucretius and Ovid position their attitudes towards love as a distraction from and/or a driving impulse for inquiry.

Johann Nikolaus Forkel\u2019s 1802 biography of Johann Sebastian Bach not only helped cement the idea of the composer from Eisenach as a musical \u201cgenius\u201d but also, arguably, signaled the birth of musikwissenschaft\u00a0(musicology) as an authoritative scholarly field. From the discipline\u2019s inception through the 1990s, biographical studies thrived through the most important epistemological transformations of musicology as a field of studies. However, at a moment when critical music research moves away from celebrating \u201cgreat men,\u201d reproducing Eurocentric teleology, and embracing grand historical narratives, one would think that the genre may lose its popularity. By critically engaging classic as well as recent music biographical literature this class seeks to interrogate the genre, its current transformations, and its future viability as music scholarship opens to modes of inquiry from ethnomusicology, popular music studies, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and performance studies.",
