But seldom do we stop to think about what a border is, or when and why some borders are defended more aggressively than others. This course looks at the modern history of borders, broadly construed, from national boundaries between sovereign countries, to supranational agreements such as the European Union. It considers how borders are erected and dissolved, both legally and materially. And it queries the legal, diplomatic, social, and ethical considerations that ensue from drawing a line between one side and another, and defending that line. We will also consider how actors within societies create internal (often racialized) boundary lines such as “gated communities” or “redlined zones,” that are sometimes extra-legal or even illegal, but have profound effects on the everyday lives of individuals and groups.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Histories, Societies, Individuals",N/A,None

Narrative voice is a lively dialogue between the author and the reader as they engage in the experience of determining the value and veracity of the narrative: whose story is it anyway? The writer creates the imaginative universe of character, plot, emotions and ideas—she seems to be holding all the cards; but it is the reader who rolls the dice as she draws on her human experience and moral values to question the principles and priorities of the storyteller. The game of narrative becomes deadly serious when storytelling confronts issues of colonialism, slavery, racial profiling and gender discrimination. Is the right to narrative restricted to those who have suffered the injustices of exclusion? What is my responsibility as a storyteller—or a reader—if I am a witness to violence, or an advocate against injustice, but my life-story is one of privilege, protection and security? What is the role of the politics of identity or cultural appropriation in determining whose story is it anyway? Throughout the seminar students will be encouraged to draw on their own histories, memories and literary experiences as the enter into the world of the prescribed readings. For the final assessment I hope students will choose critical and creative ways of telling their own stories, or the stories of others who have captured their imaginations.

As both an abstract construct and a material entity, money makes the world go around. Since before the invention of writing, money has been a common facet of everyday life, informing how we think and act. The course explores how societies across human history have made, used, and valued money in divergent ways. We will consider money as an object of aesthetic appreciation, an ethical problem, an architect of social relations, an environmental disruptor, a tool of political resistance, and much more. How has coinage design functioned as a political, religious, and cultural symbol? Is money a measure of value, and how does it align with other potential values, such as religious, moral, and aesthetic ones? Is it ethically neutral or an instrument of moral vice or virtue? What were the debates surrounding the rise of paper money? How has money been used as a tool of revolutionary movements and political resistance? Does money get recycled, and what is the environmental cost of different money forms today? What are the links between art, literature, theater, cinema, and money?

Today these same questions animate the field of neuroscience, where researchers are showing how affectivity, emotions, and our evolutionary past come together to form the “self” philosophers have long thought to be primarily “rational.” This seminar brings together the thought of James, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, with the work of contemporary neuroscientist Antonio Damasio to ask what kinds of beings we are, how our minds function, and what religion contributes to human individual and societal experience? The seminar takes up the philosophy of belief, affect, and emotion, and touches on the biology of the brain and homeostasis. We conclude by assessing contemporary views of religion from evolutionary psychology (Boyer, Atran) and cultural anthropology (Geertz, Luhrmann, Asad) in light of James’s and Damasio’s models of the human mind.","The seminar will run for only 2 hours within the time slot, Monday 3:30-5:30.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,None

Shostakovich's fifteen symphonies span his entire creative life; starting with his First Symphony, which made the 19-year old composer famous overnight, and ending with his Fifteenth, completed four years before his death. As a public genre, the symphony was the perfect vehicle for Shostakovich to react to his tumultuous times and explore the human psyche. The ups and downs of Soviet politics and culture indelibly shaped Shostakovich's career: the innovative fervor after the Russian Revolution, Stalinism (""Socialist Realism"" and the Terror), the Second World War, the post-Stalin ""Thaw"" after 1956, all the way to the height of the Cold War. Shostakovich was at times encouraged and supported by the Soviet regime, and at other times, reprimanded and punished severely.

Is this about cultural self-perception, understanding the world, cross-cultural communication, or simple propaganda?

After identifying the intellectual stakes (week 1), and discussing anecdotal glimpses from the grassroot-levels (week 2), the class deals with traditional development assistance, along with Maoist attempts to revolutionize the “world countryside” – resulting in legacies such as a China-trained guerilla fighter serving as the President of Zimbabwe. We then discuss the current footprint of Beijing, including its influence on elite politics, Chinese public and private business interests, and the diversity of the one million Chinese migrants to Africa. Four sessions specialize on (1) resource extraction versus opportunities for human capital development (2) debt-traps of Western and Eastern origins (3) emerging tensions over human rights policies (4) and the military dimension, including China’s role in Peace-Keeping Operations. Finally, the course addressees how the Chinese presence may transform established multilateral institutions, and the challenges associated with African migration to China. Social science research will be read alongside journalistic accounts and primary documents, such as leaked diplomatic cables and strategy papers. Will Africa become “Beijing’s Second Continent,” of the neo-colonial or tributary kind? What promises does the China model hold for Africans?

Social media platforms have been flooded with hashtags like #OctaviaTriedToTellUs and #OctaviaKnew as people seek to make sense of our global environmental and health crises.If Butler's visionary perspective on today's religious, political, and ecological crises is to be fully appreciated, it is essential to examine it through the lens of Black histories and literary traditions that navigate and shape new worlds. This includes exploring Black religious expressions, particularly African traditional religions, Black Christian traditions, and Black new religious movements—all of which have profoundly influenced both Butler’s personal life and her characters. The course will primarily focus on the Parable series, interviews of Octavia Butler, and secondary articles.This course is limited to 12 students.",,Harvard Divinity School,4,Available for BTI Cross Registration,Divinity School,Seminar,In Person,HDS Letter Graded,N/A,,,

As such, architecture as a discipline is not only about designing buildings, but also about challenging us to imagine new ways of seeing the world.  This studio takes on the challenge through a series of design exercises focused on understanding, engaging with, and reimaging the urban condition. Throughout the course, we will approach architectural design as both a method of producing urban environments, and also as an avenue through which to understand our cities. We will be directly confronting the social, political, and environmental contexts that are necessarily implicated in any design process.Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design. Each begins from a different scale of inquiry, but converges towards a similar end. This studio originates at the scale of the urban site, and begins with a set of design research assignments that ask students to imagine the city from the perspective of a non-human agent. Extrapolating abstract principles from these agents, we will be mobilizing the possibilities of architectural representation to reimagine the city through mapping, diagraming, and collage.The studio culminates in a design proposal for a site in Harvard Square. Students will be given an architectural brief, and will produce projects that address existing site conditions, programmatic space requirements, and projected users of the site. Technical workshops will provide all the necessary skills required for the course, and will allow students to develop aptitude in architectural drawing, mapping, rendering, and simple animation.

Ec 10b explains what economists do and do not understand about these issues by developing analytical approaches and examining data, including studying the global financial crisis and the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. The course also explains how policy makers can dampen economic fluctuations using monetary policy (i.e., government influence over interest rates and government regulation of banks), fiscal policy (e.g., government control of spending and taxation), and financial rescues in economic crises. We will also discuss how macroeconomic policies work in an international context, including the factors that affect exchange rates, trade deficits, international capital flows, and how these link economies around the world. Like Ec 10a, Ec 10b introduces students to economic models and discusses both how they are supported and how they are contradicted by available data.","Ec 10b is the second half of an integrated sequence that begins with the study of microeconomics in Ec 10a. Students may elect to take only the fall microeconomics course and receive four credits. This sequence is designed with two types of students in mind. For students who will never take another economics course, Ec 10a and 10b provide a self-contained training to prepare them to understand and engage with economic issues. For students who end up deciding to be Economics Concentrators, Ec 10a and 10b provide a wide-ranging introduction to the field and are required courses. The Department of Economics strongly encourages students considering concentrating in Economics to take these courses during their first year in the college. Ec 10a and 10b are not duplicative of AP Economics courses but aim to provide a broader perspective and a deeper engagement with public policy.

Course topics include the fall of Communism and German reunification, neoliberalism and inequality, youth culture, social democracy and the welfare state, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010s migrant crisis, and the rise of populist politics. We consider texts by Angela Merkel, Lea Ypi, Jenny Erpenbeck, Michel Houellebecq, Joan Scott, Thomas Piketty, Tony Judt, and Timothy Garton Ash; music from the Eurovision song contest; television shows such as NSU German History X; and films like the 1993 French drama La Haine, the 2003 German reunification comedy Good Bye, Lenin!, the 2013 Italian portrait of decadence La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty), and the 2016 German comedy Toni Erdmann.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History & Literature,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

Ec10a introduces students to economic models using intuitive discussions, graphical analysis, and, in some cases, basic algebra. The models study individual decision-making and markets, and range from classical approaches like supply and demand to more recent approaches that consider informational limitations and behavioral mistakes. We will also use data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these models. The course also discusses the role that ethics and values play in people's choices and in policy discussions, including an understanding and critique of approaches like utilitarianism, Rawlsian principles of justice, and libertarianism. The goal of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that will help them develop answers for themselves on how to make better choices and participate in debates on major public policy issues in areas including tax policy, inequality, discrimination and racial justice, and the environment.","Ec10a is the first half of an integrated sequence that continues with the study of macroeconomics in Ec10b. Students may elect to take only the microeconomics course and receive four credits. This sequence is designed with two types of students in mind. For students who will never take another economics course, Ec10a and Ec10b provide a self-contained training to prepare them to understand and engage with economic issues. For students who end up concentrating in economics, Ec10a and Ec10b provide a wide-ranging introduction to the field and are required courses. The Department of Economics strongly encourages students considering concentrating in economics to take these courses during their first year at the College. Ec10a and Ec10b are not duplicative of AP Economics courses but aim to provide a broader perspective and a deeper engagement with public policy and current developments in the field of economics (e.g., behavioral economics). Either Ec10a or Ec10b fulfills the Social Sciences divisional distribution requirement.

This seminar will examine and interrogate both literary and journalistic dimensions of medical writing. The investigation will be chronological, beginning with “classic” narratives by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Kafka, and then moving on to more contemporary authors such as William Carlos Williams, Richard Selzer, Oliver Sacks, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors’ behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms. The presentation of illness in journalism will be studied in selected readings from the New York Times’ and Boston Globe’s Science sections, as well as periodicals like the New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harper’s, and the Atlantic Monthly. The members of the seminar will analyze how the media accurately present the science of medicine or play to “pop culture.” The seminar will study not only mainstream medical journalists, but so called alternative medical writers such as Andrew Weil and celebrity health voices like Gwyneth Paltrow. Patients with different diseases will be invited to speak to the members of the seminar about their experiences.

This course will cover the century-long effort to resolve these mysteries and others, a story that features fantastical notions like parallel universes, pilot waves, quasi-probabilities, alive-and-dead cats, and spooky action at a distance. Throughout the course, we will engage with many relevant questions in philosophy, from determinism and causation to epistemology and the meaning of probability.Assessments: The course will have weekly homework assignments consisting of a mixture of primary-source readings, short essays, and mathematical exercises. The course will not have any exams.

This course aims to teach you how to manage argument and persuasion in your own life – not just with skill, but ethically. Accordingly, we will have two main goals. The first is to develop your skill at recognizing the myriad ways in which language can be used and misused as a tool for persuasion, by teaching you a variety of techniques drawn from formal logic, linguistics, and the discipline of argument-mapping. Master this skill, and anytime someone attempts to persuade you of something, you will be able to understand the structure of their attempt so deeply that you need not fear manipulation, but can decide for yourself whether you wish to sign on to the conclusion they want you to reach. Our second goal is even more important: we hope to show you how you can – and why you should – construct your own arguments with such clarity, honesty, and logical transparency that the people you direct them to will be optimally placed to decide, for themselves, whether and why they ought to agree with you. In this way, you will come to see argument not primarily as a contest to be won or lost, but as something that should be reclaimed for a more noble purpose: building genuine understanding between people, even across profound differences of viewpoint.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None

To begin to explore this question, we discuss key theoretical issues and illuminating examples that begin to sketch out an approach to linking language, culture, and society. Specifically, we consider the following problems: How is language use a kind of social action? (It is something we do; it has social effects.) How does language organize and provide access to shared concepts and beliefs? (It has something to do with the way we collaborate, socially, to represent, reflect upon, and think about the world.) How do speakers think about and reflect upon language, and how do these reflections affect how they use it? (We have presuppositions about what language is and rely on these notions to orient to and situate ourselves within social worlds).Throughout the course, we develop a set of powerful analytical tools for studying both language and culture and, ultimately, for defining their role in social life.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,Aesthetics and Culture,N/A,None

In the spring semester of the Intermediate course, students learn advanced skills in syntax, morphology, compound analysis, and metrics. Students learn how to analyze kṛt and taddhita suffixes, recognize a variety of poetic meters, categorize and take apart compounds in greater detail, and determine the various senses in which kārakas and vibhaktis are being used. In the final month of the course, students learn how to interpret commentarial and expository prose (śāstra). In addition to developing the discrete skills above, students read and discuss three different Sanskrit texts. We continue the story that we began in the fall semester—that of the encounter between Arjuna and Śiva in book 3 of the Sanskrit epic Mahābhārata. Then we study Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya, a sixth-century kāvya (poetic) composition based on that epic story. Finally, students practice their commentary-reading skills by interpreting select portions of Mallinātha’s Ghaṇṭāpatha, a fourteenth-century commentary on the Kirātārjunīya. Overall, the intermediate-level Sanskrit course enables students to interpret Sanskrit texts in three major genres: epic, poetry, and scholarly prose. Students expand and strengthen the skills in reading comprehension, grammatical analysis, and vocabulary retention that they developed during the first year of study. Students will be able to dissect and describe nominal compounds, verbal forms, poetic meters, and morphological and syntactical features of Sanskrit words, sentences, and verses in greater detail. As a whole, the course prepares students to participate in Sanskrit language and reading courses at the advanced level. Most lessons involve collaborative work among students. No auditors will be permitted. Enrolled students must take the course for a letter grade. Please note that this course includes a required weekly review session with the Teaching Fellow at a time to be determined within the first two weeks of the semester.Prerequisite: Sanskrit 102AR.",No auditors will be permitted.

These dangerous ideologies often masquerade as environmental consciousness.While contemporary discussions frame such rhetoric as a reaction to the growing awareness of climate change, it has deeper historical roots, particularly visible in American religious writings. Lest we forget that religion (and race) were central to the ecofascist manifestos espoused by the perpetrators of several tragic events: the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where a gunman targeted Muslims during Friday prayers at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Center; the 2015 mass shooting of Black churchgoers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas that targeted the Latinx community; and the 2022 attack at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. In the manifestos, the shooters identified as ecofascists whose mission was to protect and preserve white Christian nationalism in the wake of climate disaster.The manifestos accompanying these attacks have brought greater visibility to ecofascism today, compelling us to examine its historical roots and current operations. Is there a longer history of American religious ecofascism? How can we characterize this history, and what insights does it provide into the functioning of ecofascism in contemporary society?

Drawing on saints’ lives, theological treatises, art and architecture, and the work of authors such as Augustine, Aquinas, Thomas More, and Martin Luther, the course will examine how the interaction of spiritual ideals and material realities shaped cultural developments and affected beliefs and practices from late antiquity to the Protestant Reformation.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Medieval Studies,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

This course is designed to give students an overall good grasp of the history of the modern Middle East and of some of the major themes in modern Middle Eastern Studies. Students will critically engage with some of the most important topics that resonate in that area of the world. We will cover topics such as reformism, economic development, colonialism and nationalism, authoritarianism and democratization, sectarianism, culture, gender, literature and the arts, as well as the role of religion in politics. Most of these topics, in one way or another, will speak to the construction of nation-states in the Middle East and to the challenges they have been confronting. This is not a survey course. In particular, it will not be exhaustive in its coverage of the region in space or time, and in its coverage of topics.

How accurate are these depictions? Does it matter? This course examines the quintessential example of the “exotic, mysterious ancient world” – Ancient Egypt – to explore these questions.  Who has “used” ancient Egypt as a construct, and to what purpose? Did you know that pyramids, mummies, King Tut, and Cleopatra represent just the (overhyped) tip of a very rich civilization that holds plenty of life lessons for today? Combine the ancient Egyptians’ explanations of the world’s natural forces with all the social complexity of human interaction and you have a fully formed society—about four millennia of accumulated experience! Can investigating the “real” ancient Egypt unpack our current misconceptions about the land of the pharaohs? Hardly morose, tomb-building “zombies,” the Egyptians embraced life in all its messy details. Piety and corruption, imperialism and isolationism, divinity and mortality all played significant roles in life along the Nile. What can we learn about the nature of politics and society in our time by seeing the parallels between the ancient past and today? We will explore archaeology, modern Egyptomania, repatriation, new digital visualization technologies, and international politics. What was ancient Egyptian racism? What is modern archaeological racism? Who owns the past? Who needs it? We will take excursions into Egyptian art, history, politics, religion, literature and language (hieroglyphs), plus the evolution of Egyptology as a discipline.

The course will emphasize the entire pipeline from writing a model, estimating its parameters and performing inference utilizing real data. The first part of the course will focus on linear and nonlinear probabilistic generative/regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, Poisson regression), and algorithms for optimization (ML/MAP estimation) and Bayesian inference in these models. We will play particular attention to sparsity-induced regression models, because of their relation to artificial neural networks, the topic of the second part of the course. The second part of the course will introduce students to the nascent and exciting research area of model-based deep learning. At present, we lack a principled way to design artificial neural networks, the workhorses of modern AI systems. Moreover, modern AI systems lack the ability to explain how they reach their decisions. In other words, we cannot yet call AI explainable or interpretable which, as a society, poses important questions as to the responsible use of such technology. Model-based deep learning provides a framework to develop and constrain neural-network architectures in a principled fashion. We will see, for instance, how neural-networks with ReLU nonlinearites arise from sparse probabilistic generative models introduced in the first part of the course. This will form the basis for a rigorous recipe we will teach you to build interpretable deep neural networks, from the ground up. We will invite an exciting line up of speakers.

In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading texts from the ancient Mediterranean alongside works of poetry, fiction, and cinema from early modern Britain, twentieth-century America, and the contemporary Global South. We will look at some texts in their entirety and others in extracts, focusing on Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, Vergil’s Aeneid, Milton’s Paradise Lost, Derek Walcott’s Omeros, The Mahabharata (in prose and film versions), and George Lucas’ Star Wars, with detailed analysis of Gwendolyn Brooks’s American epics on Black life, Annie Allen and In the Mecca.

The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time.

It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction.

Guided by an interdisciplinary collection of texts, students will have the opportunity to study folklore from the ground up, not only through an academic lens, but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local communities. Throughout the semester you will be invited to develop skills in qualitative research, cultural documentation, proposal design, interviewing, and the arts of interpretation as you try your hand at fieldwork and ethnography. By examining folkways, expressive culture, traditions, and performances, and interrogating their import in the daily lives of individual and groups, we will aim to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and lived experiences, between the academic institution and the vernacular world. Ultimately, this course aims to bring “the folks” themselves into the center of the academic study, discussion, and debate.

By juxtaposing literary works from authors writing both within the boundaries of the United States and beyond, we will be able to make connections between them that highlight both their common sovereignty struggles and shared utopian visions, but also keeps in view the many meaningful differences in how Native American and Indigenous aesthetic productions perform the work of future-making.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,English,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

In many of these processes the actual steps taken by biological systems are not currently understood. Further, even the outcomes that are being realized by these processes are not well understood. In general, current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step-by-step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications, it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them. Computer science therefore offers a top-down approach to understanding what could possibly be computed in biology, and how. In this course we shall pursue this computational complexity approach, whose origins go back to Turing and von Neumann.

Technological innovation is all around us, and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. While ethical considerations enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making. This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around specific types of technology as they arise for the 21st century.

The EV transition has far-reaching repercussions from emissions to macroeconomic impacts to national security and poses substantial challenges in the rapid development of new supply chains.  In this seminar, we will study the intersection of EVs, the energy transition, environmental science, policy, and economics.

Policy is pivotal today, in the U.S. and overseas, in terms of determining the pace of EV adoption, how supply chains develop, and how fast they evolve.  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) enables faster EV adoption through tax credits for EV production and purchases.  Technological progress, especially in battery technology, will be critical in the path forward.  We will analyze a range of EV issues including those highlighted above as well as charging, health impacts, equity, and international market differences.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Envi Science & Public Policy,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

Chekhov was formed by this cultural-historical moment, and he depicted the effects of modernity on Russia of his own time, treating a wide range of characters from different backgrounds. But Chekhov has long since transcended this original context. He is celebrated as one of the greatest short story writers of all time, and his plays are performed more frequently around the world than those of any other playwright, excepting Shakespeare. Once you’ve spent time with Chekhov, he will stay with you forever.Chekhov’s work can be funny or very sad, and sometimes it is both at the same time. Much of Chekhov’s meaning lies in the details, and in what is not said as much as what is made explicit. This seminar seeks to sharpen your skills as a discerning reader and interpreter. We will also go beyond the page to explore Chekhov’s work as produced on stage and screen, beginning with his partnership with Konstantin Stanislavsky, the director of the Moscow Art Theater, where Chekhov’s plays were first enthusiastically received.

How do they arise, and to what extent is it possible for us to exercise agency over the existence and expression of our emotions? Are emotion categories like anger universal, or culturally relative? Is there something that all instances of anger (for example) have in common, or does “anger” encompass a diverse range of states and experiences? Is there a single basis for anger in the brain? Is it possible that we can create an emotion in ourselves by ascribing that emotion to ourselves?For help answering these and other related questions, we will turn to three sources, considered in rotation, to help us construct a dialogue between these authors as they develop their ideas. Brene Brown, in “Atlas of the Heart,” surveys the incredible complexity of human emotion and offers advice on managing these emotions.

This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis.

What are/were the epistemological and material vectors that constitute each word, and how do these vectors bridge the two terms, or conversely, bring them into them conflict? What specific modes of mapping the world have arisen from this combination? This undergraduate seminar sketches a trajectory of cinema as an art of formulating subjectivity in Korea, from the colonial period to the present. Bringing together multiple understandings of “technology”—in relation to mass media, natural science and engineering, and the operation of governmentality—we will probe how cinema has been a major site of technologies, a central node at which the fostering of pliant subjects for imperialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism, and heteronormative male-centered society in general; the navigation and critique of these very power relations; and encounters with new science and mass media technologies all intersected in Korea. Instead of defining Korean cinema as the homogenous realization of some unchanging cultural essence of Korea, this seminar approaches it as a conjunction of diverse modes of addressing the subject’s place within the changing techno-geopolitical, infrastructural, and ecological landscapes surrounding Korea. In tandem with an in-depth reading of each film’s aesthetic and narrative features, we will examine the rationales behind the categorization of films as Joseon film, women’s film, experimental film, Minjok film, Korean New Wave, and Korean blockbusters, to name a few, as proposed by film directors, critics, scholars, film societies, and government institutions. The focus of the seminar is placed on these cinematic genres’ (1) approach to the medium of film, audience, and screening venue, (2) their resonance with social movements and theorizations of cinema abroad, (3) the convergence of film aesthetics and infrastructural changes (train, car, factory, etc.) and new media technologies (computer animation, VR, drone, GoPro, etc.), and (4) their frustration or consolidation of the national, ideological, gendered, and epochal boundaries propping up the notion of “Korean.” Building on these concerns, students are encouraged to explore the interplay of multiple technologies through which diverse forms of subjectivity are contested, questioned, and appropriated, and to respond to the central questions posed by the seminar in their final projects.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,East Asian Langs & Civ,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The Mongol Empire has variously been credited with the inaugural establishment of a globalized world with unprecedented religious toleration and socio-economic exchange. Yet, the Mongols have also been maligned for the mass slaughter of their conquests, brutal deportation policies as well as destruction of Islamic and Chinese urban societies. Between the twin poles of efflorescence and catastrophe lies a rich geography to explore. Who was this steppe people that came to rule the largest contiguous empire in history? What underwrote their rise? How did they order such a vast realm? How much was the Mongol period a watershed for globalization? What legacy did they leave behind for successor states, cultures and the globe? We begin by looking closely at the nature of the agglomeration of peoples that eventually became known as the Mongols and how state formation in the steppe created the momentum for conquest. Next, we explore how steppe military culture combined with new technologies and operational strategies that empowered the Mongol military machine. We then turn to questions of localized rule and gender in Mongol-dominated societies. Our third approach is to look at commercial and material cultural exchange through the lens of globalization and localization: we assess the changing vectors for exchange as well as how cultural items themselves moved and transformed. This sections peaks with a discussion of how historiography under the Mongols can serve as a proxy for multi-valent elite perspectives of global empire that were simultaneously localized to their sites of production.

Such songs, known to classicists as ""epinician poems"" or ""victory odes,"" were usually performed in the victorious athlete’s native city. The poet Pindar, whose career coincides with the first half of the fifth century BCE, was a “star” composer of such victory odes, and it was a matter of stratospheric prestige for the family of a victorious athlete to succeed in commissioning Pindar to compose for their native son such a celebratory song. The odes to be read in the original Greek for this course will include selections that all students will be reading, balanced with further selections chosen by each student. The amount of reading will be variable, adjusted to each student’s degree of preparation. For example, those who have already studied Homeric poetry will be able to read more, but those students without such background can catch up rapidly, with the professor’s one-on-one help. To be studied in the course is not only the poetic language of Pindar but also the historical background of athletic festivals and of elitist as well as non-elitist ideologies linking the heroic past as a model for athletes—including women athletes.A book that will be consulted in analyzing the historical background of female as well as male athleticism is the professor’s recent book Ancient Greek Heroes, Athletes, Poetry (2024).

Attendees read a book of their choice as a way to study the art of book writing. Subsequently, they develop the skills to write a book proposal of their own. To foster peer feedback and working within a community of thinkers and artists, the seminar hosts a series of guests with whom attendees enter into conversations. Attendees will moderate discussions, serve as respondents, and engage in open discussions with some of the leading scholars and artists of the topic for the semester.            Some of the questions that we engage are: What unique ways of thinking our world might music afford? How do praxis and theory intertwine and influence each other? What kinds of methodologies and new approaches to study, research, and interdisciplinarity might listening, sound, and musicians and their work propose? Our study is aided by reading the writing of musicians who theorized the world as part of their artistic practice and of scholars whose works derive from thinking alongside these practices. Specifically, we will read musicians’ texts such as Anthony Braxtion’s Tri-Axium Writings, Alice Coltrane’s books, Cecil Taylor’s liner notes to Unit Structures, and Susie Ibarra’s Rhythms of Nature.

In Athens in the fifth century BCE, thousands would gather at the theater to grapple, through the medium of tragedy, with questions that continue to preoccupy us today: What happens if a woman is in power? How different are we from foreigners? Or what happens to the victims of war? 2500 years later, ancient Greek tragedy is all around us, from Broadway to hip hop to Game of Thrones to TV advertisements. Its adaptations can expose forms of inequity: Luis Alfaro’s play Oedipus el Rey, for example, highlights incarceration rates among Latinx communities in 21st-century America. They can examine recent historical events that have fundamentally affected our understandings of race, conflict, and immigration, from Apartheid and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Yaël Farber’s Molora) to the ongoing civil war in Syria (Queens of Syria). They can also provide models for explorations of identity—as we can see when Freddie Mercury becomes Dionysus in Queen’s iconic video for “I Want to Break Free.” In this course you will read, watch, and listen to some of the most recent reincarnations of ancient Greek tragedies alongside the original plays.

So convincing were they that one important character created by a Russian author of the nineteenth century was led to express the idea (if not exactly the words), ""if there is no God, all is permitted."" In more recent times some thinkers have challenged this assumption, and insisted that removing (or reducing) the role of God is indispensable to proper moral discourse. This course will examine the ways in which a concept of God has informed Western moral discourse, trying to help students engage the literature as they confront the basic question, why might one think ""if there is no God, all is permitted?"" and why might one think if there is a God human moral achievement is diminished or impossible. Further, we will examine ways in which the differing paradigms actually affect the moral conclusions we might generate.Belief in God and denial of God's existence have each figured prominently in Western moral discourse. Arguments have been advanced that: autonomous human reasoning is incapable of arriving at moral truths without a supreme principle to ground the system (which is sometimes invested with ""personality"" and called God); that autonomous human reasoning can have no impact on moral behavior due to human failure that only God can ""correct""; that autonomous moral reasoning is impossible, and morality can only be understood as the submission to the will of a superior moral being; that a concept of God is necessary to direct and regulate moral reasoning, but the actual confessional versions of theism are metaphysically implausible or impossible; that autonomous human moral reasoning is impossible with God, and thus only a-theism can lead to moral conclusions.

You’re one of the suckers, so are your friends, so am I, so is everybody. We don’t notice we’re being scammed because what is being stolen is not our money. What’s being stolen is our attention and our time. We’re all suckers for clickbait. What’s wrong with clickbait is that it leads you down a rabbit hole of misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories that have created and sustained widespread skepticism and mistrust of science and scientists resulting in covid-19 conspiracy theories, vaccine hesitancy, bogus drug treatments, climate change denial, anti-evolution, and so forth. Even the most educated and savvy consumer of information is easily misled in today’s complex information ecosystem. This seminar is clickbait vaccine to boost your critical thinking. It is designed to help you identify and refute misinformation, disinformation, and BS rampant on the internet. It will help you recognize sensationalism when science is communicated in the press.

Did the Prophet Muhammad preach monotheism to a group of crude idolaters, or were his opponents already monotheists (if imperfect ones) who were also familiar with biblical ideas about God and history? Was Mecca an important center of Arabian pilgrimage and commerce before Islam, or was it a small town of local significance that grew in influence only after Islam? Did the followers of the Prophet and the residents of Arabia imagine themselves as sharing a common ethnic identity as “Arabs,” or did they subscribe to a multiplicity of local tribal or geographical identities and developed a shared sense of being “Arab” after they conquered the Near East? Did the early Muslims believe in the imminent end of the world or not? Was Islam originally an ecumenical monotheistic movement open to Jews and Christians, or did Islam’s earliest adherents consider it a new and exclusive religion separate from Judaism and Christianity? Is the Qur’anic text a record of Muhammad’s own preaching or the result of a collective effort that continued after him (and perhaps had begun before him)?

In this course, we’ll learn how sexual identity and desire are understood and represented in different social and historical circumstances. We’ll move beyond the binary of identifying images as “positive” or “negative,” paying attention to how depictions, definitions, and understandings of sexuality are shaped by specific historical moments, as well as the aesthetic traditions and personal experiences shaping these individual works. Along the way, we’ll unpack terms such as “intersectionality,” “feminist,” and “queer.” We’ll think carefully about how the evolving nature of language and terminology—for instance, the shift from “same-sex marriage” to “marriage equality”—affects political discourse and shapes our understanding of what is possible. In addition to novels, we’ll look at op-eds, essays, poems, plays, photography, performance art, and film with an eye to thinking about how different genres speak to the larger world of politics, activism, citizenship, rights, and popular culture. Learning how to decode metaphors and images in novels, films, and other works will make you a more sophisticated reader of the texts that circulate outside the classroom.

Building on the foundations of Marxian philosophy and the works of 20th-century critical theorists such as Lukáçs, Benjamin, Heidegger, Marcuse, and Foucault, we will explore more recent contributions in the philosophy and post-phenomenology of technology as well as social constructivism and feminist theory. While largely designed as a theory course, this tutorial takes a closer look at artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, surveillance capitalism, data feminism, and digital culture to investigate how these new technologies shape our social reality. The tutorial ends with a module on Afrofuturism as a potentially emancipatory form of techno-utopianism.  Questions we will address along the way include: how do science and technology transform and mediate human experience and knowledge of the world? radically affect our political and social order? shape concepts of human subjectivity and regulate human behavior? And what kinds of political, ethical, and aesthetic consequences do we need to consider as we adopt new technology? Rather than conceptualizing science and technology in Promethean terms as “tools” of progress, we will closely examine how they are intrinsically constitutive of the ways we experience ourselves and the world around us. The aim is to collaboratively articulate, over the course of the semester, an amplified social theoretic framework that enables us to critically engage with the existential challenges and potential dangers of new technology and normatively evaluate scientific and technological innovations from the standpoint of human flourishing.",This course will be lotteried and is open to non-concentrators if space permits.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,Social Studies,Tutorial,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

(More than half of CS50 students have never taken CS before!) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today's newer languages, via which you'll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project. See https://cs50.harvard.edu/college for advice, FAQs, syllabus, and what's new.

Self-help books offer to teach it. Both the arts and the sciences celebrate it. It sits at the heart of some of our oldest myths and is the subject of up-to-the-minute neuroscientific research. Some say it comes in momentary flashes; others call it a way of life. Some identify it as the key to deep fulfillment; others claim that it entails intense suffering. Many agree that it sets us apart as a species—but does it? What is creativity? How have humans made sense of it across centuries and cultures, and what role might it play in our lives today? Exploring creativity takes us into the very question of what makes us human, and the answers we discover can help equip us for the lives we will lead beyond the classroom. This course casts a wide net, crossing disciplines as it takes us from ancient treatises on the art of poetic composition to modern brain scans, and from centuries-old debates over intellectual property to present-day questions of artificial intelligence. Is creativity the same as originality? Can plagiarism be creative? Should one own the fruits of one’s creative labor? What happens in the brain at moments of creative insight? Can creativity be “hacked”? We will hear directly from practicing artists and experts as we explore these questions through regular, small-stakes creative experiments and a creative final project.

Religion will feature prominently, as we study sanctuaries, ceremonies, and rituals that inspired movement or mobility at either the local, regional, or imperial level. More social questions related to migration will examine the historical evidence for large-scale demographic displacement and its causes, but we will also incorporate relevant data produced by recent advances in archaeological science.

Modes of practice will include audio recording, sound design, editing, and postproduction. We will begin by examining the rubric of “multimodality” in the context of anthropology, and its ethical implications and possibilities for approaches to sensory ethnography.

Through readings and listening sessions (or “screenings”) we will also listen beyond the academy to experiments in other domains, including sound art, ethnographic film, and other nonfiction media practices. The course seeks to problematize, perhaps even undermine, and reformulate ideas and practices which combine audio with moving image or other media. Aesthetics and ethics, theory and technique, concept and practice are interwoven at every level in multimodal work, and so this course will combine technical workshops with working through conceptual and theoretical motivations and implications of the work throughout the semester.

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy. An important part of the course is the display of Harvard flight instruments in the laboratory and the strategy for addressing unsolved scientific problems with new instrumentation.","EPS 166 integrates the challenges of climate scientific objectives with the strategy for instrument innovation, the lab is also integrated with the course structure.

Students develop a movement skillset different from that of the actor or dancer, specific to the puppeteer. While training students’ bodies, the course expands their minds’ ability to recognize the potential for liveness in all things and generate story without words. We work with simple objects, solo tabletop puppets, giant ensemble puppets, and bunraku-style dolls.Similar in format to a dance class, students begin each day with movement exercises training specific puppeteer skills: manipulating energy inside and outside the body; harnessing momentum and suspension; moving body appendages separately from one another; and performing ‘invisibly.’ Exercises lead into improvisations. Students learn to devise original dramatic material with patterns and movement dynamics in every class. We begin with non-anthropomorphic, simple objects like spheres and sticks, followed by materials that can spontaneously transform into creatures, like newspaper. At midterm, students each devise a solo scene with a tabletop puppet, figurative or otherwise. The foundation movement skills provide a common vocabulary for giving and receiving feedback. This trains students’ eyes for analysis and offers a path forward for revising their performances.The second half of the course focuses on multi-operator puppets where leading and creative following is key. Students learn to perform in a group, attend to all action onstage, and, in improvisation, react with the best choice for the whole. With bunraku-style puppets, we study how to convey a sense of gravity, the mechanics of puppet walking and running, puppeteer choreography, and what makes a puppet appear to think and feel. Movement work is supplemented with short readings that engender a conversation on the nature of puppets. What is or isn’t a puppet and why? Who is the puppeteer within a scene? How can this unique relationship dynamically change to support the storytelling? How does the inanimate nature of a puppet inspire choreography as well as thematic content? What is a puppet stage and how is it central to story and liveness?The final project is a group scene performed for a live audience during reading week.

Small losses most of us learn to bear with equanimity. But enormous, wrenching, life-changing losses open voids in our lives for which we can never feel adequately prepared, even if we can see them coming. This course tries to understand the nature of loss on a physical and emotional level, to give us some framework for coping with it and to help us develop some empathy in those very difficult situations when someone else has faced a loss and we do not know how to react.       Our main focus will be upon the loss of someone “close” to us, through either death or a personality-changing accident or illness (“close” is in quotation marks, because some of these losses may be of public figures whom we have never met personally, but whose loss makes an impact on our entire society). We will compare this form of loss with others, such as loss of country through exile or forced migration and loss of part of oneself through amputation. Our approach will be threefold: we will try to understand the physiological and psychological effects of loss; we will study the rituals that different societies have evolved to mark loss and memorialize the lost; and we will analyze literary, musical, artistic, and architectural expressions of loss, chiefly “great works,” but also some quite humble attempts to record the emotional rupture that loss entails.       We will work on a broad canvas, both spatially and chronologically, looking at testimonies as various as Cicero’s reactions to the death of his adult daughter; interviews with refugees from the war in Syria; and poetry inspired by the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial. We will read four books: the memoir of a survivor of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004; a novel about a woman’s gradual loss of her mental capacity to Alzheimer’s Disease; and the accounts of two great twentieth-century authors, C. S. Lewis and Joan Didion, each struggling to survive the loss of their spouse. We will encounter tombstones with simple inscriptions commemorating the death of family pets from the Roman world and set these in the context of scientific research on the human-animal bond. We will study prayers for the dead in the major faith traditions, and visit (virtually) the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, to consider the therapeutic effects of the somber walls of its octagonal interior. We will study photographs by Dorothea Lange documenting poverty and hopelessness during the Depression. We will learn how to listen to a Requiem Mass, whether we encounter it in a sacred building or (more likely) a concert hall.                  By the end of the course, which will have ranged far beyond these few examples, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the effects of loss on us both individually and collectively, and of the rituals and therapies that different societies have developed over time to mark and manage it. And we will have learned how fragile is the nature of what we love, and how much we should cherish it while we have the chance.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Aesthetics and Culture,N/A,None

As a foundational element in the structure of U.S. society, slavery has made a lasting imprint on social, cultural, political, economic, and ecological relations. Nevertheless, American public culture has avoided sustained exploration of the broad and complex history of racialized slavery and instead maintains a stance of discomfort, distance, and ambivalence.

But do you even know what a “book” is? Is it merely a conveyor, a platform, for presenting a text? Can a book have a use other than being read? Does the nature of the material artifact inscribed with words shape or influence the way you understand their meaning? Do people read a scroll differently than they do a book with pages? Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed—from tablets to e-books—and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a “book,” from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations—and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them.

How similar are languages across modalities (signed/spoken)? Do the languages we know determine the thoughts we can think? Do we think (only) in language? Are there right and wrong ways of speaking?

The focus is on scene and monologue work using contemporary texts from theater, television and film. Core components of the class include the idea of navigating a situation as you actually would in real life, how to read a scene or monologue to figure out what your character might want from a situation, “action-based acting” (how a person might go about getting what they want from the other person), how to find a personal connection to a character, and how to choose material that best suits the individual actor for auditions and scene work. The focus is on scene and monologue work as well as learning how to audition. We’ve designed the class around very tangible and concrete ideas and techniques, so that those who might be intimidated by the idea of an acting class, or an arts class in general, will feel exceedingly comfortable. We always have a lot of students from non-art concentrations who have had no previous art class experience, and they have found the process quick and easy to learn.

What is the role of the individual in it? How can we change our societies? This course introduces students to the field of sociology. By surveying social theory as well as empirical studies, students acquire what C. Wright Mills calls the ""sociological imagination"": the ability to think beyond our personal lives and to connect the experiences of individuals with large social structures. We examine common-sense assumptions about culture, politics, history, and psychology, and empower students to replace them with evidence-based reasoning. This gateway course introduces students to the intellectual insights and analytical tools of Sociology across the subfields of race, class, gender, politics, violence, culture, and inequality. Students are trained to critically analyze the evidence and research methods used in sociological research, and to communicate sociological ideas powerfully and succinctly through effective policy writing. Whether you plan to become a doctor who understands the social determinants of health, an education expert seeking to improve US schools, a not-for-profit worker supporting community organization, or a corporate consultant looking to improve organizational efficiency, the foundational concepts and research practices of sociology will empower you to understand, analyze—and maybe even change—our social world.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Sociology,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary-critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, ‘Course Schedule’, for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader issues: metaphysics, politics, inequality, race, colonialism/imperialism, the white gaze. You will not only have read the assigned text with critical rigor but also taken notes of the points you want to raise in class. While I do not expect you to hand in short critical essays on the texts, I will be looking for engaged, alert discussions, so it may help to have something written down to facilitate our conversations. Please note: Reading the assigned text is obligatory. Previous Creative Writing workshop experience is desirable. If you’re writing YA fantasy, there are other courses on offer that would be a better fit.In the second half of the class, divided into two equal segments of 55 minutes each, we will be workshopping the writing of two students. To this end, every week two students will hand in something they have written, to the tune of 2,500-5,000 words, to me and to everyone in the group, ideally one week before their turn. At our first meeting, I will circulate a rota for you to put down your names and walk you through the syllabus, the aims and objectives of the course, workshop rules, expectations, requirements etc. For our first workshopping session, two students should hand in work five to seven days before. Our goal is for each of you to have two turns, and approximately 5-10,000 words of your work critiqued, by the time semester ends. Copies of these writing samples will be returned to you at the end of each workshop with comments from me and from everyone in class.

This seminar will address these and other questions related to the fallibility of memory by considering evidence from studies of healthy people with normal memories, brain-damaged patients who show dramatic forgetting or striking memory distortions, and neuroimaging studies that reveal brain regions and networks that are linked to memory.  The framework for the seminar is provided by the idea that the misdeeds of memory can be classified into seven basic ""sins"". Three of the memory sins refer to different kinds of forgetting (transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking), three refer to different kinds of distortions or false memories (misattribution, suggestibility, and bias) and the final sin refers to intrusive recollections (persistence). We will consider how the memory sins impact everyday life and discuss the possibility that they can be conceptualized as by-products of adaptive features of memory, rather than as flaws in the system or blunders made by Mother Nature during evolution.  Relatedly, we will also discuss the interplay between remembering past experiences and imagining future experiences, which provides clues regarding the nature and fallibility of memory.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,N/A

Evolving Morality: From Primordial Soup to Superintelligent Machines,GENED 1046,Joshua Greene,2026 Spring,Full Term,2026-01-26,2026-04-29,1:30pm,2:45pm,Mon Wed,13089,203129,No Consent,0,0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"How can we understand the evolution of morality—from primordial soup to superintelligent machines—and how might the science of morality equip us to meet our most pressing moral challenges?In this course we’ll examine the evolution of morality on Earth, from its origins in the biology of unthinking organisms, through the psychology of intelligent primates, and into a future inhabited by machines that may be more intelligent and better organized than humans. First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below—born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the “is” of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental “oughts” of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what’s right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth’s evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children? Across diverse topics, this course explores the implications of a single idea: that the wonder we see around us, and ahead of us, is the product of competition and cooperation at increasing levels of complexity.","Not open to students who have taken PSY 2250.

After introducing systems thinking, with a focus on interconnections and feedback loops, the course will address a significant interdisciplinary issue: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relationship to human cognition.The study of AI and human cognition is both timely and dynamic. This expansive domain integrates computer science, statistics, big data, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. As a transformative technology, AI has achieved remarkable success in understanding natural language and emulating human reasoning, making it invaluable in augmenting human cognition.Despite these advances, many questions remain about the nature of AI and its relationship with human thought. This course invites participants to explore these questions through an intellectual journey. Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI’s power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises.

What makes a novel “political”? Can the novel make a contribution to political theory? How does our understanding of political power change when we imagine detailed and dramatic confrontations between individuals and the state, individuals and empire, or individuals and global ideologies? How does narrative form reinforce or undermine ideology? What archetypal dramas—protest against authority, the loss of political innocence, the battle between tolerance and conviction—have shaped the political novel in its various traditions from the nineteenth century to the present? We will consider these questions through some classic and lesser-known political novels from the nineteenth century to the present day, with readings from Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ivan Olbracht, Arthur Koestler, Ursula K.

How do political and social arrangements of labor help produce and reinforce racial categories while solidifying the boundaries separating masculinity and femininity? Through a mix of primary and secondary sources, this seminar explores histories of emotional labor and the power structures that give meaning to often taken-for-granted categories of work.

It transcends the Western paradigms by which African nationalism has been understood to interrogate African histories and the oral and visual cultures that have shaped nationalism, and the culture of power that has informed African understandings and expectations of sovereignty. The first two decades of independence witnessed the popular endorsement of the “developmental” state, which had rapid economic growth as its objective. The failure of the developmental state, both socialist and capitalist, overlapped with the rise of authoritarianism, and ushered in Africa’s lost decade of the 1980s – one of marked decline in agricultural productivity and reverses in industrialization. The informal economy assumed a dominant position in most African national economies. In the post-1980s, the West, and now Asia, have assumed leading roles in Africa’s developmental agenda.

Why Do Native People Matter?: History and the Politics of Making It,HIST  116,Kabl Wilkerson,2026 Spring,Full Term,2026-01-26,2026-04-29,,,,17615,226492,Instructor,0/15,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Historians of North America have traditionally discounted the histories of Indigenous peoples who have called its many environs home since time immemorial. This is certainly the case for scholars of United States history. As Western Shoshone scholar Ned Blackhawk has written, “Indigenous absence has long been a tradition of American historical analysis... exiled from the American origin story, Indigenous peoples await the telling of a history that includes them.” With Blackhawk’s words in mind, this course asks an essential question: why do Native people matter to US history? In pursuing an answer to this question, this seminar will focus on aspects of Indigenous sovereignty, race, gender, and environments in the process of U.S. expansion and grapple with the ways in which these struggles over land and sovereignty shaped the United States through the production of its history. Students will engage with the histories of various periods in “Native American history” and historians’ (academic and lay) assessments of them to understand the practice of writing history as itself being a political process, integral to the very phenomenon examined in class. Over the semester, students will utilize museum collections in the Harvard Peabody Museum and Harvard Archives, and explore a range of methods in the discipline of history to grapple with and ultimately re-narrate the Native history of Harvard University.","This course meets the ""Beyond North America"" History Concentration requirement.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,History,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

At the same time, the “AI boom” has raised profound questions about creativity as an essentially human trait and inspired widespread concern about AI impacts on human and nonhuman environments–or all creation.  Observers often describe the moral and existential challenges that such innovations present as new and unprecedented. But, in fact the concern is at least several centuries old. Drawing on canonical works of literature, philosophy, and cinema, this course will offer an introduction to the long history of thinking about, and working with, new technologies in the arts and humanities. In addition to close reading and analysis, students will engage in a series of “critical making” projects using historical artifacts housed in Harvard’s collections and brand-new generative AI tools developed specifically for us.

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives! Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. In this seminar, lectures during the first half of each class will provide overviews of the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep.The second half of each class will be devoted to student-led discussions of assigned study questions as well as free discussions. In a short term paper, students will research in depth a topic of their choice that they find particularly interesting related to sleep neuroscience or mental health.Students will also briefly present what they have learned about their topic during the final class meetings. Some topics students might choose are described in the following paragraph. In addition, students will keep a nightly sleep and/or dream diary for 2-3weeks at some point during the semester in order to learn more about sleep from their own experiences.They will then describe what they have observed in a short essay.In the past, students have found this exercise to be especially interesting. Lastly, there will be a short open-book, unlimited-time final exam on material from the lectures.Topics for term papers might include the characteristic abnormalities of sleep in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive or neurodevelopmental disorders.Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and a contributing cause of mental illnesses. Thus,one might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness,such as the circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness or insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. Still other topics might focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and cognitive performance. For those with more cellular neuroscience interests, topics might focus on linkages between sleep and immunity or the role of sleep in disposal of abnormal proteinsas it relates to neurodegenerative diseases.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,"Mind, Brain & Behavior",Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

They include forced sterilizations, the “euthanasia” systematic patient murder program, and forced brutal medical experiments on the living and the dead. However, under conditions of oppression by the same political system, some health care professionals chose to retain the healing powers of medicine.Anatomy in Nazi Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the medical sciences that reveals the complex relationships between scientists and the Nazi regime. Changes of the traditional anatomical body procurement manifested in the use of many bodies of Nazi victims in teaching and scientific investigations. Research gradually moved from routine studies to murder, from the anatomy lab to the Nazi prison system and then to the concentration camps. Ultimately, anatomists were complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived “enemies” of the Nazi regime.This history of medicine can thus serve as a model for the recognition of patterns and common roots with other histories of discrimination, oppression, and atrocities.

We will look at a number of different attempts to do this from a wide range of times. We will pay particular attention to the Ancient Greek Pyrrhonians and the Ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi, reading both the original texts and later commentaries on them.

We’ll consider, in particular, writers who quote other writers at length—close reading them—but in nonplussing, counterintuitive, even shocking ways. Monica Youn and William Empson, for instance, read John Milton against the grain; Pierre Bayard returns to Agatha Christie’s Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? and suggests another solution to its murder mystery; Adam Phillips reimagines Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener as a tale about an eating disorder. W.E.B. Du Bois, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov and Anne Carson all write major works that are also experiments with the rhetorics of literary criticism. Which all raises the question: how should we write about books now?

Propaganda is disseminated through forms of mass and social media, and it is used in political campaigns, during wartime, in advertising, art, film, music, journalism, and even in education. However, just because propagandists attempt to persuade you doesn’t mean that it will work every time. A variety of factors, particularly other people in our social networks, can prime us for manipulation, but they can also protect us from being manipulated. The intimate connections we maintain with others and the kind of circles we run in may even predict which types of propaganda we will believe and why. In this class, we will take a sociological perspective to the study of propaganda and persuasion in media.

Yet the links between influential fields of social science – especially economics – and behavioral medicine remain underdeveloped.  This course will first explore the frontier of concepts in psychopathology, including perspectives from rational choice theory which are both limiting and illuminating in the ongoing quest to characterize mental health and mental illness.  The course will then turn to the social and economic drivers of mental health.  From deaths of despair and the U.S. opioid epidemic, conspicuous consumption and income-wellbeing relationship, social media and American teen distress, and our general state of misery despite unprecedented material affluence, this course will systematically investigate the influences of society on mental health. Unlike most courses on mental health in other departments or medical schools, the syllabus will uncover unique empirical insights produced by the field of economics, and review in detail the econometric techniques used in these studies. Third, we will turn to the influences of mental health on society. We will consider extreme outcomes in housing markets such as homelessness and its relationship to severe mental illness. We examine classical approaches in economics to the housing market and homelessness, including new insights from behavioral health and transnational perspectives. Finally, we will turn to the roll of interventions.  From pharmacotherapy, new interventional techniques (ECT, rTMS, ketamine), therapy, nutrition, and health system organization, ACT teams, supportive housing, we will consider potential and limitations in current societal responses to mental illness, using cross-national comparisons to illuminate the important differences in outcomes.  We end with a consideration of the goals of economic policy, and examine how a focus on enhancing human mental wellbeing may offer unique opportunities in climate change and growth policy.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Economics,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,"Introductory Micro (Ec 10a), Statistics (Stat 100/104/110 or equivalent) and Calculus (Math 19a, 21a or equivalent)",N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

Basic techniques will be introduced from selected performance traditions from Sanskrit, Kabuki, Kathakali theater traditions to Butoh dance, Grotowski's movement lab, Scott Graham’s “Frantic Method” and Joshua Fried's headphone work. We will discuss how material may be generated through these performance methods (and will engage parallel discussion about the ethics of using quoted movement from cultural ritual and performance traditions).We will both investigate and physicalize the practices and methods of devised theater from the early 20th century to present (with a particular focus on the Dada and Futurist movements of 1910’s-20’s, as well as on the methods of Bertolt Brecht). Short Futurist and Dadaist scripts will be analyzed and performed as spoken text becomes more prevalent in composing classwork. Students will write a short paper on three generative techniques covered in class and will research--or create--a fourth generative technique (from any art form) and present/discuss briefly in class (and possibly physicalize, depending on the nature of the technique).Utilizing deeper levels of Viewpoints work, Richard Maxwell and BMG's 6-Archeypte Wheel, the Frantic Method and contact improvisation we'll explore more complex qualities of character, identity, archetype, mannerism, linguistic disfluencies (verbal and non-verbal) and psychological subtext.We will shortly immerse in the world of comedy improv w/ a series of games and exercises designed to deepen intuitive 'play' impulses, deepen ensemble cohesiveness and provide more methods for material generation. We will also briefly explore Rasa Boxes as an improvisational tool.Daily class time will often involve some sort of performance or improvisation by individuals or assigned small groups, culminating in final performance projects at the end of the semester.  Along the way, we will continue practice of simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument. The class will be both rigorously physical and dialogic...and often fun!","No prior performance/acting/movement experience is necessary, though it is strongly encouraged to take the ""Physical Approaches to Acting and Storytelling"" (TDM 121MV) class first to set foundations for the vocabularies and concepts of this class.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,"Theater, Dance & Media",Studio,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

It was originally used to write the Sumerian language, a language that continued to be written for over 3 millennia and produced a corpus of well over 100,000 preserved texts. The act of writing—a means of externalizing and visually representing language—has an inherent materiality to it, one that was new and innovative in the ancient world. In this class, we will explore the relationship between the Sumerian language and the materiality of its writing. Topics will include:How did the cuneiform script develop from visual depictions of material objects to abstract, polysemous signs? How were clay tablets made? How were they prepared for writing? What was the process of inscribing Sumerian on other materials? How did formatting of the tablet develop to provide additional information beyond the text itself?

Case studies focused on various groups of Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for discussion of many different aspects of Mesopotamian religious life.The civilization of Sumer is the oldest civilization in recorded history; the first texts known to humankind were written in Sumer over 5,000 years ago. From the start of writing, and continuing over next three millennia, Sumerian texts offer a multifaceted wealth of insight into religious practices and beliefs of the ancient world. From these texts, we learn about ancient conceptions of creation, the universe, and humanity; myths about gods, goddesses, and demons; the performance of rituals and cultic rites; the construction and provisioning of cult statues; the day-to-day functioning of ancient temples; and much more. Elements of Sumerian religion can be traced through subsequent and surrounding cultures and traditions, both in Assyria and Babylonia, and further afield in the Hittite, Israelite, and Greco-Roman worlds. The study of ancient religions is not only integral to understanding these societies and civilizations to which they belonged, but it also serves as an invaluable point of reference for reflecting on modern-day religions and worldviews.Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for exploring all the topics mentioned above. Primary texts will be provided in transliteration and translation; students will read the texts in translation while making frequent reference to the original Sumerian.

The course will examine the historical conditions in which these traditions emerged, and in which they have developed. It will also explore the premise that while the contents of otherworldly abduction/intrusion narratives often show remarkable similarities between one cultural context and another, storytellers from different times and places have deployed these traditions in substantially different ways. We will investigate possible reasons both for these similarities and for these differences, drawing especially from relevant scholarship in folklore studies, anthropology, and the comparative study of religion.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Folklore & Mythology,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Consider water: vapor, liquid, solid! The solid phase will generally have a crystalline structure (liquid is amorphous or has no long-range order).  It can be an insulator, semiconductor, or metal; it can be magnetic or non-magnetic. In this seminar we shall discuss a number of remarkable phases of matter. Below a certain temperature a metal can become superconducting, flow of electrical current without resistance; helium liquifies and at lower temperature becomes a superfluid, fluid flow without dissipation. As temperature is lowered, magnetic moments on atoms in a solid align and one observes a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phase. Not all materials have a solid phase: helium remains a liquid as temperature approaches absolute zero. But, applying pressure causes liquid helium to solidify.  We shall discuss not only the materials but the techniques to create high and low temperature, high pressure, and high magnetic fields that affect the phases of matter and how they are studied. We will not carry out rigorous arguments for the behavior of matter, but rather rely on so-called “hand-waving” arguments.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

It will address questions like the following:Does the existence of widespread ethical disagreement mean that there can’t be any objective facts and it’s all just a matter of opinion? Can we reconcile the idea of an objective ethical reality with evolutionary and sociological arguments that explain how we developed our beliefs? Is it strange that there can be facts that tell you what to do?We will begin by examining three famous arguments for an “anti-realist” metaethics: J.L. Mackie’s arguments from disagreement and from “queerness”, and Sharon Street’s “Darwinian dilemma”. All three arguments challenge the idea that our ethical beliefs reflect some kind of mind-independent facts. We will begin to develop philosophical skills through close analysis of these arguments, identifying their logical structure and the places where they could be challenged. We will then apply these skills to a series of texts defending alternative metaethical views, including reductive and non-reductive naturalism, quasi-realism, and constructivism. We will explore those four positions and the main challenges for each of them. Throughout, we will ask whether our ethical beliefs are on surer footing than some other kinds of normative beliefs, especially beliefs about aesthetics, beliefs about rationality, and – most importantly – beliefs about what we should believe.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Philosophy,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

The concepts taught result from decades of scientific research. Research is a process of inquiry that seeks knowledge about important problems that are not understood. Experiencing the intellectual excitement and challenges of performing research can support your long-term career goals regardless of what those are, but how does someone go about creating new knowledge through research?Lab courses teach the mechanics of performing specific techniques, keeping a notebook, and interpreting data, yet they rarely address how new knowledge is generated. How does a scientist know what questions to ask? What makes a question worth spending time and resources on? How do scientists come up with strategies to address these impactful questions? All scientists start by critically evaluating a field, but what does that mean? How do you read a scientific article and analyze their methods and conclusions? How can primary literature effectively help frame the questions in need of answers? This seminar guides students into the world of scientific research and prepares them for a real-world research experience. Through different assignments students learn how scientists think and perform science, while developing critical thinking and reading skills that are especially useful in research.

The course is a journey through vibrant historical hubs, each connected in a complex web of trade, culture, and politics. From Byzantine Constantinople, Europe's cultural and commercial powerhouse, to the kingdom of Aksum, East Africa's crossroads of trade and religions, and from the splendor of Venice to Hangzhou, one of ancient China's capitals, as we trace Marco Polo's footsteps. Delving into the rise and fall of empires and kingdoms, we will investigate conflicts, journeys of exploration, economic and scientific developments, and a rich tapestry of art and material culture.At the core of The King's Money is the study of medieval currencies—the most widely circulated art form extending from Britain to the Indian Ocean. The course highlights how coins, seals, and medals served as vital symbols of political authority, artistic innovation, cultural identity, and economic exchange. By examining how disparate communities separated by language, religion, political systems, and swathes of land and sea interacted through currencies, we will gain insight into the profound connections money forges along routes of trade, warfare, pilgrimage, and diplomacy. The course also examines the lasting impact of medieval currencies on 21st-century economics, art and literature, politics, and national narratives, as well as their significance in museum collections and the digital landscape, emphasizing their relevance to our modern world",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History of Art & Architecture,Seminar,N/A,None,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

European empires in Africa sought to impose their ideas of ""civilization"" and ""modernity"" on Africans through organized athletics, and yet Africans themselves - both during and after the period of European rule - used athletics for their own purposes. Notable athletes played a key role in both combating and supporting colonialism, and in establishing national identities following independence. In recent decades, Africans have starred globally at the Olympic Games, the World Cup, and many other global athletic competitions. And increasingly, individuals from more recent African diasporas have starred for countries around the globe, raising important questions about belonging, diaspora, and nationalism.

If humans were all the same, free of identity, ideology, or culture, then many social scourges—prejudice, discrimination, perhaps even some violent conflict—would be dramatically reduced, if not eliminated. But with diversity also comes the wonderful variation that allows for the forces of evolution and innovation to better societies. In response to this tension, humans have created institutions to manage diversity by regulating conflict and reconciling differences of opinion. Politics is the process of navigating these difference managing institutions. The problem of politics then is the problem of diversity.Drawing on the disciplines of political science, psychology, economics, and philosophy, this course examines the question of how diverse societies and institutions can be successful. The course ultimately aims to provide students with the tools to be informed citizens and leaders in a diverse society.In the first part of the course, we start with the psychology of division, examining the basic question of why there is variation between humans and why this variation affects our social behavior. We then examine the consequences of diversity. Why does diversity make the necessary elements of society, such as coordination, difficult?In the second part of the course, we will draw primarily on philosophy to ask if diversity is a desirable state for societies and institutions or if societies should rather seek homogeneity.Having considered these questions, in the third part of the course we examine how political institutions manage diversity by employing different strategies, sometimes strategies of division and sometimes strategies of creating unity. Drawing on classic works of political theory and contemporary political science, we will examine institutions, including ethnonationalist and multicultural states, constitutions, and other institutions that are created to successfully manage diversity.Finally, in the fourth part of the course, we will examine the public policy of managing diversity. How do societies choose to manage public spaces, restrict flows of immigration, and create institutions, such as schools, to reconcile a diversity of interests.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,None,N/A,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None

Theater and Theatrical Culture in Early Modern Japan,JAPNLIT  262,David Atherton,2026 Spring,Full Term,2026-01-26,2026-04-29,3:00pm,5:45pm,Thu,16083,226316,No Consent,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,"The Edo period witnessed the rise of two major theatrical forms—jōruri (puppet theater) and kabuki—that would exert an enormous impact on early modern culture. Both remain living performance genres today. Yet studying them as forms of early modern theater proves daunting. Both forms have undergone significant changes since the end of the Edo period (as, indeed, they transformed across the centuries of Tokugawa rule). And because performance is, by nature, ephemeral, reconstructing the dynamics and experience of an early modern play presents significant challenges. This is particularly true in the case of kabuki: a form for which the script (few of which survive) served primarily as a general outline for performances that could change significantly from one showing to the next. Yet both theaters left a wide range of traces in diverse media: playbills, actor critiques, actor and theater prints, objects, book illustrations, and theater-related books of all varieties, from satirical “audience critiques” to adaptations of plays into illustrated print fiction (kusazōshi). This seminar has three aims. First, it will introduce students to practical methods for studying early modern performance: familiarizing them with archives of theatrical ephemera, introducing strategies for accessing elements of performance from secondary materials, studying accounts of playwriting and performance by early modern playwrights and actors, and weighing the pitfalls and rewards of relying upon the conventions of modern performances. Second, it will invite students to understand early modern “theater” not only as a matter of performance, but as a broader cultural phenomenon that most people accessed not within the playhouse, but through secondary media like playbills, prints, critiques, merchandise, and fiction. And third, the seminar will delve into broader cultural, social, and political dimensions of theater in the early modern period, touching on such subjects as the relationship between the theater and the sacred; the theater’s relationship to early modern discourses of emotion; the body of the actor and the performance of gender; fan culture; the relationship between urban and rural theatrical culture; and the ongoing debate about whether early modern kabuki is better understood as a subversive or a conservative genre.

Through a series of case studies, the course explores art historical issues for which the folding screen provides a unique perspective, including the relationships between painting and architectural space, poetic practice, and religious ritual.  Functioning simultaneously as furniture and pictorial surface, spatial divide and architectural decor, the folding screen has played an important role in shaping culture and lived experience in the Japanese archipelago for over a millennium.  Transportable and displayable in a variety of ways, the folding screen can surround a space and immediately charge it with meaning. Some of the most historically significant Japanese paintings were executed in this format, and its influence around the world can be seen in everything from the painted panels of James McNeil Whistler to the biombo of colonial Latin America. This graduate lecture surveys the history and development of the Japanese folding screen from the 8th to the 20th centuries. Each week will focus on one case study from the screen painting tradition to highlight a historical theme and methodological problem closely linked to the unique properties of this format. These themes offer a range of issues crucial to the reconceptualization of Japanese painting history as a whole: 1) The function of screens in different social spaces (the Nara Imperial Palace, the Heian aristocratic compound, the Buddhist temple hall, the Ashikaga shogunal residence; or the modern reception room); 2) the various text-image relationships embodied by different types of screens (including both the relationship of painting to poetic practice and the pictorialization of narrative texts); 3) the role of screens in religious ritual, including the Esoteric initiation (abisekha) ceremony and mortuary practice; 4) compositional strategies reflected in the adaptations of painting subjects in other formats to the folding-screen surface; 5) the function of screens as representations of different types of topoi, charged with a panoply of political and cultural meanings; and 6) the interpretation of depictions of screens within other paintings.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History of Art & Architecture,Conference Course,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

While Shi’a Islam is a minority sect within the larger Islamic World, Shi’a Muslims are estimated to comprise some 35-40% of the population of the Middle East. The rise of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq, and the world’s only theocracy in Iran all represent major changes in the politics, society, and trajectory of the region linked to Shi’a Islamic revival and mass movements that include both political parties and armed wings. This course addresses the role of Shi’a Islam in the contemporary Middle East especially after the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran through to the 2003 Iraq War, the Iran-Saudi rivalry, fluctuation of sectarian identities, civil conflict, proliferation of non-state actors and Shi’a militias, and the current geopolitical competition over the security architecture of the Middle East. The course further focuses on the foundations and varieties of modern Shi'a political thought and theology; the history of religious clerical institutions (the system of Grand Ayatollahs); Shi'a political parties and paramilitaries in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; and Iran's Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and the Basij paramilitary organization.

There are nearly 20 rhythm and movement stylings situated within Koteba.

The things that arrived in Harvard’s collections came in many forms, ranging from great architectural monuments and motifs to little stuff such as belt buckles, pilgrims’ flasks, and fragments of pottery. Why did we want medieval stuff? And what have we since learned about the world from which it came? This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard’s collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects—things, images, texts—in Harvard’s collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object’s acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard’s collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world. The semester ends with a concrete proposal to the museum regarding areas of the collection that we need to build up to promote the concerns and issues of our own day.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Aesthetics and Culture,N/A,None

What is it like to be a child? Drawing on the tools of sociology, we will see how children’s lives and life chances are shaped by their social position, their social contexts, and the broad social structures in their society. Additionally, we will examine how the very notions of “childhood” and “adolescence” are socially constructed, varying across history and cultures rather than stemming from biology alone. We will consider why contemporary constructions of children are so contradictory—sometimes framing them as victims needing protection, and sometimes as deviants needing correction—and what these views say about broader societal anxieties. Next, we will examine several key influences on children’s socialization, highlighting how class, gender and race shape children’s experiences. Throughout, we will consider how children actively shape their own social worlds, and how their existence shapes society itself.

Nowadays, in the majority of markets, a handful of firms interact strategically and compete in numerous dimensions, including prices, products offered, advertising and investment. We will use formal models in order to address questions like: Why are markets organized the way they are? How does market organization affect firm behavior, such as firm production or pricing? How does the behavior of firms in turn affect the market structure? How does government policy shape firm behavior and market structure? What is the impact on welfare? Through the use of both theory and data, we will attempt to answer these questions.The course will proceed in three parts. We will first tackle decentralized markets; i.e. markets where many small firms compete in an ad hoc fashion (e.g. taxis, oceanic shipping, real estate). A recent and growing phenomenon in this setup is the emergence of platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, Uber Freight, Airbnb, etc. We will discuss their impact on markets and societal welfare.Then, we will introduce key concepts from the field of Industrial Organization in order to study oligopolistic markets. Through the use of models (mainly game theory) but also empirical analysis, we will explore the strategic interactions between firms and the impact of market power on society. Using these tools, we will study collusion and mergers. We will rely on game theory to analyze the strategic environment under study.Finally, we will study market power in global markets. In a strong recent trend, governments around the world are engaging in industrial policy (e.g. Made in China 2025). What are the rationales behind these initiatives? Are they effective? What is their impact on both domestic and global societal welfare? In this last part of the course we will focus on the role of governments in shaping global competition.The goal of this class is to get you engaged in topics of current interest and heated policy debates; “what is market power and how does it affect the world?”, “how has uber changed transportation?”, “does industrial policy work?” but also to get you to think about these questions through the rigorous lens of an economist armed with a good combination of formal modeling and empirical tools.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Economics,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community.

How do the historical, social, cultural, and legal frameworks around a text shape its meanings and its effects? Combining major critical and theoretical writings with primary works, the course investigates how literary production and interpretation are informed by philosophical and aesthetic traditions, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, national and post-colonial identities, and the material forms in which literature circulates, from parchment books to the internet. Students will also practice fundamental literary research methods through close engagement with Harvard libraries.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,English,Tutorial,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities
