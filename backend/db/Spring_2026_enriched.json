While Shi\u2019a Islam is a minority sect within the larger Islamic World, Shi\u2019a Muslims are estimated to comprise some 35-40% of the population of the Middle East. The rise of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq, and the world\u2019s only theocracy in Iran all represent major changes in the politics, society, and trajectory of the region linked to Shi\u2019a Islamic revival and mass movements that include both political parties and armed wings. This course addresses the role of Shi\u2019a Islam in the contemporary Middle East especially after the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran through to the 2003 Iraq War, the Iran-Saudi rivalry, fluctuation of sectarian identities, civil conflict, proliferation of non-state actors and Shi\u2019a militias, and the current geopolitical competition over the security architecture of the Middle East. The course further focuses on the foundations and varieties of modern Shi'a political thought and theology; the history of religious clerical institutions (the system of Grand Ayatollahs); Shi'a political parties and paramilitaries in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; and Iran's Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and the Basij paramilitary organization.

Through her work she brings that history alive in all of its violence, contradiction, pain, and pleasure, seeking to make the unknown, repressed, forgotten, or erased visible, legible even as illegible, somehow even potentially livable. Her poetry--and her criticism, as I often find it hard to distinguish, fully, between the two--is a refuge and a refusal, performing a contradictory doubling without which we can't survive, without which we probably don't deserve to (thrive). The course will be an exploration of Howe's project, with crucial attention to the work Howe reads, to reading and rereading Howe's work, and to thinking about the archive itself and its relationship to possible futures.This is a limited enrollment course.

It was really not hard or time consuming at all*** Lectures were from 3\u20135pm which is like primary nap time for me (homeostatic sleep pressure was high, as you'll learn in the class), so being completely honest sometimes it was hard to stay awake. However, I always fought to stay awake because the lectures were sincerely so entertaining and informative (eat some Altoids mints). The professors have so many cool anecdotes about their lives, and everything you learn in that class somehow ties back to your own life. Section is very helpful too, as lectures are only once a week and it helps to really consolidate/review everything in the last lecture for the weekly quiz (super easy, 3 questions, don't sweat it). This was legitimately my favorite class I took this semester. I was originally on the fence about adding it to my schedule at all, but I'm so glad I did.

In this course, we will investigate the role of colonialism and neocolonialism in racial imaginations of gender and sexuality and how these histories shape contemporary understandings of LGBTQ politics, reproductive and sexual rights, and anti-colonial resistance around the world. We will explore histories of sexual control, colonial and racial difference, and marginalized, queer, and trans sexualities in colonial and postcolonial spaces, including parts of West Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The course will cover many forms of sexuality, including interracial relationships between colonizer and colonized peoples, questions of sexual violence, queer desires, sexual outcasts like \u201cprostitutes,\u201d \u00a0transgender rights, and the politics of gender difference and LGBTQ rights in the postcolonial world.",

Readings and class activities will engage New England colonialism, the long history of Indigenous dispossession and resistance, and the political struggles of Indigenous communities today. We will closely examine texts including poems, speeches, oral narratives, maps, short stories, and deeds, exploring the centrality of land and environment in colonial and Indigenous histories and literatures. In the second half of our class, we will work collaboratively to design and execute group or individual research projects.

We are the only ones who expend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and resources trying (sometimes obsessively) to understand our futures before they happen. While the innate ability of individual people to predict has not changed much in the past few millennia, developments in mathematical and conceptual models have inordinately improved predictive systems. These systems have integrated comparisons to past results and quantified how \u201ccertain\u201d we can be about various aspects of the future -- processes that were, in many cases, inconceivable at one point in the past. This course is a coordinated investigation of the history and future of prediction, beginning with Ancient Mesopotamians reading signs in sheep entrails and ending with modern computer simulations for climate, health, wealth, and the fate of our Universe. In this class, you will design your own predictive systems to critically engage with assumptions about how the world works and situate your explorations in a study of how motivations and techniques for divining the future have changed\u2013and not changed\u2013throughout human history.",

      "Take this class if you are ready to deep dive into Asian literature! Although it is a survey class, and many weeks you will read excerpts rather than the whole work, it is still quite intensive! The workload and time commitment is certainly manageable, but because the class meets once a week for nearly 3 hours, our conversations can get really deep and still require ample effort/preparation. Nonetheless, it is structured so some weeks will be heavier than others, so if you need a break, you will get one some weeks. If you are passionate about Asian/Pacific/Asian American history and Asian/American women's history, this class will be very enjoyable and fruitful for you. It is a great way to gain exposure to more writers, learn about history/imperialism/misogyny/modernization, and build up your back pocket of works you are able to reference. Professor Choi is very knowledgable on the topic and has high expectations for you, even though she will adjust the course to help you succeed! Even though it is a chill and understanding class (as many WGS classes are), Prof. Choi still makes discussions very deep and you will have to read actively! There are not many assessments, which I really enjoyed, besides the big final project, which can be as inventive as you like. I don't think you'll regret taking this class, but it's also not a must\u2013take! Very useful nonetheless to expose urself to more authors",

But seldom do we stop to think about what a border is, or when and why some borders are defended more aggressively than others.\u00a0This course looks at the modern history of borders, broadly construed, from national boundaries between sovereign countries, to supranational agreements such as the European Union. It considers how borders are erected and dissolved, both legally and materially. And it queries the legal, diplomatic, social, and ethical considerations that ensue from drawing a line between one side and another, and defending that line. We will also consider how actors within societies create internal (often racialized) boundary lines such as \u201cgated communities\u201d or \u201credlined zones,\u201d that are sometimes extra-legal or even illegal, but have profound effects on the everyday lives of individuals and groups.",

The writer creates the imaginative universe of character, plot, emotions and ideas\u2014she seems to be holding all the cards; but it is the reader who rolls the dice as she draws on her human experience and moral values to question the principles and priorities of the storyteller. The game of narrative becomes deadly serious when storytelling confronts issues of colonialism, slavery, racial profiling and gender discrimination. Is the right to narrative restricted to those who have suffered the injustices of exclusion? What is my responsibility as a storyteller\u2014or a reader\u2014if I am a witness to violence, or an advocate against injustice, but my life-story is one of privilege, protection and security? What is the role of the politics of identity or cultural appropriation in determining whose story is it anyway? Throughout the seminar students will be encouraged to draw on their own histories, memories and literary experiences as the enter into the world of the prescribed readings. For the final assessment I hope students will choose critical and creative ways of telling their own stories, or the stories of others who have captured their imaginations.

Since before the invention of writing, money has been a common facet of everyday life, informing how we think and act.

We will consider money as an object of aesthetic appreciation, an ethical problem, an architect of social relations, an environmental disruptor, a tool of political resistance, and much more. How has coinage design functioned as a political, religious, and cultural symbol? Is money a measure of value, and how does it align with other potential values, such as religious, moral, and aesthetic ones? Is it ethically neutral or an instrument of moral vice or virtue? What were the debates surrounding the rise of paper money? How has money been used as a tool of revolutionary movements and political resistance? Does money get recycled, and what is the environmental cost of different money forms today? What are the links between art, literature, theater, cinema, and money? Be part of a thrilling journey of exploration that will take us from the economic systems of Ancient Mesopotamia to 21st-century digital currencies.

You learn how to think about experiments in new ways and be better able to critically evaluate claims people make about experimental designs. You might even discover a topic you're interested in pursuing for a senior thesis or just otherwise (on the flip side, the midterm and final papers are so open that you can continue to explore existing interests/organizations you're already part of). Make sure to go to the TF and Prof. Pallais for feedback on your midterm and final paper ideas so they can make them even stronger. Also, don't be fooled by the first topic listed on the syllabus: we skate by regression discontinuity and diff\u2013in\u2013diff designs \u2013\u2013 the course talks about them just to say what we're ~not~ focusing on.

    "course_description": "The symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-75) are just as relevant and controversial today as they were during the composer's lifetime. Shostakovich's fifteen symphonies span his entire creative life; starting with his First Symphony, which made the 19-year old composer famous overnight, and ending with his Fifteenth, completed four years before his death. As a public genre, the symphony was the perfect vehicle for Shostakovich to react to his tumultuous times and explore the human psyche. The ups and downs of Soviet politics and culture indelibly shaped Shostakovich's career: the innovative fervor after the Russian Revolution, Stalinism (\"Socialist Realism\" and the Terror), the Second World War, the post-Stalin \"Thaw\" after 1956, all the way to the height of the Cold War. Shostakovich was at times encouraged and supported by the Soviet regime, and at other times, reprimanded and punished severely. But Soviet audiences always treasured his work because they heard in it deeply felt emotions that could not be publicly acknowledged. Today's audiences react just as strongly, for different reasons. In the seminar, we will listen closely to all fifteen of Shostakovich's symphonies, learning about their musical features and the political contexts in which they were born and received. We will focus on three main themes: 1) composing in a totalitarian state, 2) how music can be said to \"narrate,\" and 3) the orchestra as sound world. We will work from scores and selected recordings, and will attend a live performance of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.",

We will focus on developing skills in close reading, while using this monumental work to survey the flourishing cultural landscape of early modern China. Our discussions will situate the novel alongside recent scholarship on gender and sexuality, material culture, and performance.

His reference bewildered observers who were unaware of a long tradition of citing Romans 13 in American political controversies, including such formative conflicts as the American Revolution and the sectional crisis over slavery.This course introduces students to a complex history of political invocations of scripture, encouraging them to think about why this practice persists, the interpretive strategies it involves, and the implications of such scriptural appeals for civic culture. Co-taught by faculty with expertise in biblical studies and American history, the course asks students to engage texts thoughtfully, to consider historical contexts thoroughly, and to see why these texts and their use matters in the present.Course materials includes primary sources (e.g., campaign speeches, Congressional debates, Civil Rights slogans) and scholarly literature, such as the wealth of research on the history of biblical justifications for war or the legal theories that guide applications of the First Amendment.Student projects afford class participants the chance to engage in both historical research and textual hermeneutics. The objective of the course is to equip students to recognize the historical legacies that contemporary political conversations carry, to engage critically the modes of textual interpretation that inform political rhetoric, and to write cogently about the complex implications of political appeals to scriptural authority.",

It's very different from what you'd expect judging from just the title of the course, but no joke, it's the best Gen Ed I've taken here, and I firmly believe the Harvard experience would be so much better if all other Gen Eds were structured like this. No busy meaningless work; the few assignments we had were actually meant to help us engage with the course material, and didn't ask anything beyond that. Prof. Holland does an amazing, amazing job at showing just how messy, complicated, and central of a role scriptural invocation has played in American political life. I have no religious affiliation at all, and I found the course instruction to be incredibly even\u2013handed, fair, and interesting to learn. Not only were the history lessons themselves actually cool and fascinating, Holland also does an incredible job in including and fleshing out overlooked histories of religion in American life, such as the Nation of Islam, queer hermeneutics, and many other niche topics you'd likely miss out on in a generic American history of religion course taught elsewhere. Also, Prof. Holland is a master of the English language; it's crazy how he answers student questions with such beautiful yet concise responses. He speaks exactly how a great author writes, and it blows my mind how he can come up with that language on the spot. The TF team was also goated this year; they're all incredibly sweet Div School grads who show up to class with their own rich understanding of the works we engage with.

Students will learn about the history of theatrical producing and the evolution of the role of producer. Additional units will focus analyzing the mission and vision of nonprofit institutions, labor negotiations and collective bargaining agreements, financial analysis, commercial vs. nonprofit producing, and the role of the audience in performance.",

      "This was a great class! If you are interested in producing, specifically for the theater, I would recommend you take it! You learn a lot about the different components of what goes into producing and will definitely leave the class more aware of the industry. The material is interesting and you get super cool experiences like talking to artistic directors at theatre companies. However, it is a niche industry, and if you are more interested in the film/television production world, this might not be the class for you as there are differences. Overall though I had a great time.",

Is this about cultural self-perception, understanding the world, cross-cultural communication, or simple propaganda? More importantly, how can we tell China stories from perspectives outside of China?What seems beyond dispute is the power of stories to bring China to the world and the world to China. In exploring the \u201cfictional turn\u201d of contemporary Chinese cultural politics as it relates to the world, we will also trace its genealogy to earlier historical moments. Stories matter in China, not only in our times but also throughout history.Narrative fiction is one of the most effective ways to engage with the Chinese past and the Chinese present. Instead of presenting China as a monolithic civilization, this course uses stories to understand \u201cthe world of China\u201d and \u201cChina in the world\u201d from ideological, ethnic, cultural, and geo-political perspectives. The course highlights the variety and vitality of stories from both modern and pre-modern periods. In genres ranging from religious allegory to science fiction, from moral fable to fantastic romance, from philosophical anecdote to political satire, Chinese stories have enlightened, intrigued, puzzled, and scandalized readers, reflecting and constructing ever-changing worldviews.",

We will examine questions such as: How does the brain process threats, and how do we learn about potential threats from others? How, and why, do our memories for emotional events differ from memories for mundane events? How does the brain process rewards, and respond to social rewards such as trust? What can we learn about implicit social biases from understanding their representation in the brain? What can we learn about the brain systems of human emotion and social interactions from studying other animals? Building on this foundational knowledge, we will explore how advances in human brain science might inform larger societal issues, including legal decisions, clinical interventions for the treatment of anxiety, and racial bias.",

Moving from Chinese farm households in Mozambique to state-owned copper mines in Zambia, military bases in East Africa and the United Nations headquarters, this seminar critically assesses the potential for China\u2019s presence to transform Sub-Saharan Africa. After identifying the intellectual stakes (week 1), and discussing anecdotal glimpses from the grassroot-levels (week 2), the class deals with traditional development assistance, along with Maoist attempts to revolutionize the \u201cworld countryside\u201d \u2013 resulting in legacies such as a China-trained guerilla fighter serving as the President of Zimbabwe. We then discuss the current footprint of Beijing, including its influence on elite politics, Chinese public and private business interests, and the diversity of the one million Chinese migrants to Africa. Four sessions specialize on (1) resource extraction versus opportunities for human capital development (2) debt-traps of Western and Eastern origins (3) emerging tensions over human rights policies (4) and the military dimension, including China\u2019s role in Peace-Keeping Operations. Finally, the course addressees how the Chinese presence may transform established multilateral institutions, and the challenges associated with African migration to China. Social science research will be read alongside journalistic accounts and primary documents, such as leaked diplomatic cables and strategy papers. Will Africa become \u201cBeijing\u2019s Second Continent,\u201d of the neo-colonial or tributary kind? What promises does the China model hold for Africans? How do the partners on both continents react to experiences of disillusionment and retreat?

As such, architecture as a discipline is not only about designing buildings, but also about challenging us to imagine new ways of seeing the world.\u00a0 This studio takes on the challenge through a series of design exercises focused on understanding, engaging with, and reimaging the urban condition. Throughout the course, we will approach architectural design as both a method of producing urban environments, and also as an avenue through which to understand our cities. We will be directly confronting the social, political, and environmental contexts that are necessarily implicated in any design process.Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design. Each begins from a different scale of inquiry, but converges towards a similar end. This studio originates at the scale of the urban site, and begins with a set of design research assignments that ask students to imagine the city from the perspective of a non-human agent. Extrapolating abstract principles from these agents, we will be mobilizing the possibilities of architectural representation to reimagine the city through mapping, diagraming, and collage.The studio culminates in a design proposal for a site in Harvard Square. Students will be given an architectural brief, and will produce projects that address existing site conditions, programmatic space requirements, and projected users of the site. Technical workshops will provide all the necessary skills required for the course, and will allow students to develop aptitude in architectural drawing, mapping, rendering, and simple animation. No existing expertise or technical proficiency is necessary for this course. Students from all backgrounds are welcome; we will be encouraging interdisciplinary thinking throughout the design research process.",

We will analyze the speeches as pieces of legal rhetoric and for the insight they offer into ancient approaches to crime and punishment, the regulation of sexuality, the trial jury, and court procedure. Taught by a law professor, the focus will be on comparing ancient and modern approaches to problems faced by all legal systems. We will use the ancient material as a jumping off point to debate modern legal topics such as the role of victims in the criminal process, jury nullification, the proper exercise of discretion in prosecution and sentencing, the provocation doctrine in modern homicide law, transitional justice institutions (human rights prosecutions, amnesties, truth commissions); theories of punishment, the use of collective sanctions in international law, free speech and the protection of dissent in a democratic society, and direct vs. representative models of democracy. Approximately half of each class session will be devoted to discussing the Athenian cases, the other half to discussing analogs in modern legal debates.",

There are no lecture slides or any teaching of content that you weren't expected to read about beforehand. PSETs were very reasonable except for the fact that you actually have little guidance on what is actually important from the \"readings\". there were no practice exams for the midterm or the final so no one had a clue of what was going to come up unless you make it to office hours if your lucky enough to have that time available in the week. Labs were good and were actually a pleasant break from lecture. final project was fine but it would have been better to have more time for a more thorough final project rather than a final exam (this class has both a final project and a final exam ). Section is great and Griff is wonderful soul who cares for his students and made the class bearable. Heat transfer is an interesting topic but please consider if you as an engineer really need to do an entire semester on radiation, conduction and convection. the class used to incorporate mass transfer too which I recommend that they revert to. Also I thought this class would teach me COMSOL but it didnt. we had two classes on COMSOL where we essentially followed a step by step pre made guide from the active learning labs.",

      "The course is not too bad, but it is crucial that you understand the material early enough (it builds up throughout the whole semester) and don't get caught in a cycle as you will be having labs, psets, and exams every week for the course. The components aren't  overwhelming, but can be if you are taking other courses as well (took with LS1B and Math 1B). Be ready to study and put in effort though, the class is really not bad in hindsight but it was often overwhelming and stressful knowing you have other exams and work on top of understanding this material.Try on EVERY exam, especially the first. Getting three attempts on a question is better than two or one as you will not always get an easier question on the next attempt or can make a small, correctable mistake that you can try on the next exam.  This happened and often found myself stressed over stars to get a good grade, but everything worked out in the end once I realized how to study for the course and learn the material. The questions are also not easy, there is no partial credit and you will need to get every component 100% correct to get the point which can often seem overwhelming. The concept of stars seemed great, then horrible, but then great once I got the rhythm of efficiently studying. The psets are also designed to challenge you, but make sure you understand them weekly as if not, you will struggle on the exams (like it said in the syllabus). I found myself only completing the psets and not really understanding them which made for applying what I learned so much more difficult. Definitely know the lecture material before attempting, it will all click once you get it. Kathryn and Gregorio are great professors and want you to succeed. Make sure to use their office hours effectively as their sessions are the most useful. They are also happy to meet 1 on 1 if you are struggling, which helped me get caught up and get back on track.The labs are heavy coding based, but not bad. Definitely know the basics python if possible, it will make them labs so much easier, but they are also not very hard and are mainly there to reinforce concepts from lecture and are mainly taking data and analyzing it with python equations.Stay on track, understand the material, put in effort on exams and you will succeed! Getting an A is not too hard, definitely doable.",

The course will include a dissection of a human brain, an examination of how the actual brain maps onto two dimensional neuroimages, and discussions of how the classic lesion based maps of cortical function are related to contemporary maps based on functional neuroimaging.",

      "Oh boy... Real Analysis. First and foremost, there is no getting around this. This class is hard. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly: The good: This is a difficult class, which sometimes can be made more difficult due to: idiosyncracies, arbitrary grading, and unnecessary difficulty on assignments. YMMV,  but there wasn't a lot of that under Prof. Max Weinreich. That's not to say the class was perfect. But it also was not horrible.  Max was a great lecturer, but a little monotone sometimes. He was hard to reach outside of class/OH. The midterm was fair and we got a nice curve. The bad: However, some things you should know: Your experience in the class will depend a lot on who the professor is, and how many times you go to office hours a week. Some Psets were easy and doable, others were near impossible unless you went to OH. There were two WONDERFUL CA's, but other CAs were not as good. The first few Psets will be graded as if you were a mathematician, and errors will cost you. Then, they relax the grading. This tends to be due to different reasons, but I like to think is to give you a false sense of improvement. There's arbitrary grading and you should reach out when this happens. The ugly: Some problems were hard enough that CAs even had trouble solving them. If a CA doesn't know how to solve a problem... that will tell you. This is my general guideline: If the Prof is writing their problems, you'll be ok. If they are choosing problems from Rudin, then good luck. This was a WAY better class than last Fall, which under all metrics was a horrible experience for everyone. The final exam was rough. Instead of testing knowledge of a definition or theorem, you need to realize \"the trick\" that each problem requires. This is more on intuition than true knowledge. We were given a review sheet of 10 problems and told to study it intensely. Only 3 problems showed up in the final and one of them was *heavily* modified. It should have been a take\u2013home or something. TLDR: Max is good, other profs may not be. OH is the most valuable resource for Psets. If exams are in person, they will be difficult but hopefully curved. Find friends and build a study group!",

Notice that the first couple weeks of the class were unbareably hard because of its long psets. I had an amazing schedule. I was waking up at 7, sleeping at 12, etc. I was on top of my game! I was doing all the readings for my classes. I was writing my reading responses with so much attention to detail. Then, the third and forth psets came in. They hit me like a truck! I pulled an all nighter for each of the psets even though I put in 50 hours a week for my classes overall. The ripples from those all\u2013nighters made my whole semester miserable. Because I pulled an all\u2013nigher, my other work had to be delayed. Then, the work after that got delayed. Stat 111 caused a domino effect that ruined my semester. I unequivically blame Stat 111. I have no extracurricular activities. The ones I was in, I gave up on ALL of them, just to be able to keep up with myy classes. How can a pset for a class take ~20 hours to finish? None of the CS124 psets took that long. I got an A in Stat 110 and in 111.  The concepts in both I love and I have covered somewhat before because of math olympiad. I got the psets done. Every week. I pulled back\u2013to\u2013back all\u2013nighters because I am not a quitter. But the psets were simply too tedious for the first 4 weeks. Legend has it that one of those weeks, MORE THAN HALF of the class had not submitted the pset by the deadline and took the extension. I was determined to not take them since I knew that my second half of semester would be even worse (it was worse indeed). Because of this, apparently, Joe decided to give everyone an extra extension. IT DOES NOT HELP to make the course lighter after the fact. I couldn\u2019t care less about the easier weeks afterwards because they are not the issue here.Make the time commitment an even 13, heck an even 16, but do not make it 27 hours one week and 7 some other week. I pulled a total of 7 all\u2013nighters for this class. Having done all those all\u2013nighters, I think my life was shortened measurably. I think I might have killed millions of neurons in pursuit of perfection in this class. I blame myself for creating my schedule first, but then I blame Stat 111 next. In total, I spent 169 hours on this class. With that, this class takes third place among all the classes I\u2019ve taken with CS61 and CS124 coming in first and second with 196 hours and 180 hours total respectively. If the course continues like this next year, please use your extensions on the earlier, tedious psets. The later psets, as seen in the data, are relatively fine. Anyways, how to do well in the class? Know stat 110 well. Know your conjugacies, know your pdfs, know the properties of the distributions you\u2019ll be working with. Memoryless property, chicken\u2013egg etc. Read the stat 111 textbook (a new addition to the course this year). The textbook is amazing. It has too much info that is not all relevant to the class.  But the textbook is a superset of the class. Read the book and the lectures will become review. If you read the textbook, you\u2019ll also see special derivation etc. that will give you new methods of problem solving for the psets. You better go into the class with a pset group. My god was it necessary. You should to be able to talk through problems and ideate. Going to OH for every question is hard. Collaboration within the confines of the collaboration policy is key. The TFs are nitpicky. The grading RUBRIC is nitpicky. The psets were graded out of 48 for most psets and each question has an excrutiating amoung of subparts. Each subpart is worth, say 1 point. YOU WILL LOSE 0.5 of that for the smallest of reasons. Note that your psets are worth 45% of your grade and so each pset is almost 5% of the grade. Be as perfectionist as possible. Double proofread just to make sure. The smallest things! Because of the denominator, each small loss adds up quickly and suddenly you might find yourself with whole percentage points lost on your final grade because of silly mistakes. A friend of mine experienced this. I repeat, BE PERFECTIONIST. There are exponentially diminishing marginal benefits to another round of checking your pset. But you do want to get an A, right? So buckle up and do it. I did not go to a single lecture for the class. Totally unnecessary. Watch them all online. I have a panopto extension that allows me to watch the lectures at arbitrary speeds. Watch it at a speed comfortable to you. I watched at 2.5\u20133.5x speed. Frequently stop the lecture and take notes. That way, it will come out to be about 1\u20131.5x speed still, but you will get a series of notes out of it. On that note, please take notes. It helps a lot with review and you better believe you will need that review material come midterm and final season. This class, similar to Stat 110, is extremely well staffed. The stat department is really good at this (at least for 110 and 111). There are office hours in convenient times and locations almost all days. Even as a quadling, I had access to 4 different office hours in 4 different nights. Thanks here to Jamie, Nick, Shea, and other TFs that I am currently unable to remember on the plane. Tips for R, LaTeX and submissions:For R:Learn how to vectorize everything! It significantly increases your productivity and reduces execution time. Functions such as replicate, sapply, lapply together with anonymous functions are VERY helpful for coding up stuff. Watch some tutorials and it will pay dividends as the semester goes along. There will be a lot of times where you will have to do some calculation/data generation and then repeat it for some B times. I recommend writing a function that does the procedure for one iteration of it and then using the replication/application functions mentioned above to process it for the total B times. Ends up being very clean and fast code. Learn to use the documentation. Use ChatGPT for your graphing needs. You have the data, let GPT handle the specific code needed to display it well.  R Studio:Its a piece of S**t. Compared to VSCode, it is garbage. But you are sort of stuck with it. I explored running R in VSCode, in NVim, etc. None are as good imo. LEARN THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS. Please! I cringe everytime someone manually goes to the beginning of a line to change that line to a comment. Use Ctrl+Shift+C instead. Learn how to copy and past whole lines and reorder them with just alt lol. If you have the time, change the shortcuts to those you are familiar with. This will noticably improve your quality of life. When you're close to the deadline, the last thing you want is for your progress to be halted by R Studio. How to put code in your pdfs? Here's my process. I hated R Studio, so I only used it to **write** my R code and test it. Once done, I used RTEX to compile my final doc. I use a VSCode extension called LaTeX Workshop to compile latex on my local computer (eliminates reliance on janky harvard wifi and Overleaf). This extension can be used to write rtex files as well. The workflow goes as follows: Download that week's pset. Optionally generate a pdf for my ipad with more spacing between questions to handwrite some answers. Copy the .tex file into a separate folder and name it with the .rtex extension instead. copy over csv files and resources that the .tex file needs to the same folder. Whenever I want to insert R code, I write the following incantation: <<cache=TRUE>>= [MANY LINES OF R CODE HERE]@.The extension neatly runs the code and plugs in both the result and the code into the pdf file. Super convenient. The cache=TRUE allows for computation to not be repeated for each LaTeX compilation round since simulations can take some time to finish.  It only reruns if you change the code withing the incantation. Writing latex itself is slow and so I try to write in the fastest medium. Questions about explaining intuition are done in RTeX. Questions about code get done in RStudio and then the code gets copy\u2013pasted into Rtex as well. Having done the pset, the pdf generated in computer is sent to ipad for final assembly with handwritten answers. Never had an issue with using handwritten submissions for some questions/parts.Midterm stats: Direcly from Joe: mean = 67, SD = 22. (first quartile, median, third quartile) = (52, 70, 85)Final Stats not released. I feel stockholm syndrome from this class. It might have convinced me to do stat AB/AM instead of the CS AB/SM. See my other reviews for the many woes of the CS department. The concepts you learn here are invaluable. Together with Stat 110, this class has literally changed the way I think and my everyday language. Cs124 was tedious too, but also almost nothing from it stayed with me. Stat 111 though, has changed the way I have discussions with my friends. The concept of conditioning is really the soul of statistic and perhaps rational judgement itself. Not to get to philosophical here, but this class will change how you think, period. Do I recommend the class? You bet I do. Suffer through it and come out the other end a new person. Battle scarred, but a veteran. I wish you serenity for the many frustrations you will experience with the class and for the many all\u2013nighters you might embark on. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world.",

It will help so so so much! Class support is great (preceptors, CAs, MQC, etc.) and as long as you stay on top of the concept, the workload and content is fairly digestible.",

The problem sets are difficult, and often cover content that was not taught in lecture. The exams include 20 true/false questions and the practice tests are hard. Overall, you need to do a lot of outside of lecture reading and studying to understand the content enough to do the homework. The final counts for 40% of your grade, and there isn't a curve.

      "Overall: CS 148/248 is a VLSI design course centered on building a full tape\u2013out of a CMOS camera chip, covering all its components including digital logic, pixel arrays, SRAM memory, pad rings, and wire bonds. A great follow\u2013on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred\u2013slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one\u2019s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year\u2013to\u2013year): MOSFET circuits, RC\u2013timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout\u2013level inverter/nand/nor/half\u2013adder/full\u2013adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically\u2013generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega\u2013OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch\u2013up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in. Additionally, the distinction in expectations need to be made more clear between 148/248.",

      "Even though 3 psets a week can look scary, I promise that Math 1b is a course worth taking, especially if you don't have a very strong background in math. For example, I came to Harvard that I hadn't done integrals in school, and so I needed a course which would make me go back to the basics and do a lot of math, and 1b definitely gives you that: psets are long but not too difficult, and are super useful to learn the content from sections. Small sections are great, you get to actually do Math in class and even to know your classmates. Exams are super fair: they prepare you with much more difficult practice tests, which is good (heard of the opposite for many other math courses!). Jonier is a great teacher and his exams, as I said, are super fair.

      "Okay, first the pessimistic side of things: Physics 143b is hard. Not for everyone in this class, many people seem to be chilling, but from someone who is generally maybe not the brightest physicist let me tell you that for us normal kids it is really hard. HOWEVER, it is doable. I never went to office hours before taking this class, which I definitely had to change. And you certainly need to put some hours in, but no one fails and people care for you, especially Prof Mitrano. And now to the optimistic side of things: Prof Mitrano is A\u2013MA\u2013ZING!!! He cares so incredibly much about this class, he encourages participation so well and above all his humor is so sharp and great that it is a pleasure going to class. He creates a great sense of community (the fact that it's hard also plays into that community\u2013building aspect) and I got my graded exams back three hours (!) after I put down my pen. He also really cares about how things are going with this class, so if something is going harder than you think it should go you can and should definitely tell him right away. And for the academic side of things: I only understood how little I had understood from 143a and quantum physics after taking 143b. There is a reason why the courses have the same number, not necessarily because the topics overlap a lot but because you won't get any understanding of quantum with just taking 143a. I would say I only understood like 70 % of this class but at least now I understand everything from 143a and trust me I did not understand anything coming out of that course. So take this class. If you want to go to grad school or not, it is worth it. I will probably not go any higher level for now but it was definitely a really rewarding experience and trust me: If I could do it, you can do it for sure! :)",

      "THIS IS A GREAT COURSE. Professor Samuel is such an amazing human being and very smart. It was interesting to hear him ask insightful questions during talks. The course format involves meeting twice a week: visiting a research lab on Mondays, usually in LISE, Lyman, Jefferson, Northwest, or sometimes Mallinckrodt, and attending a talk on Tuesdays. There is free dinner in Lyman before the talk with the professor, where they discuss their research and career journey, and it has always been fun attending the dinners. Besides attendance, we had to write three response papers. These papers are about what piqued our interest from the talks and research lab visits. Writing the response papers might seem intimidating at first, but it is actually not bad and can be interesting if you ask the right question. There was also a final presentation at the end about one of the response papers. It was not a lot of work, just a brief 10\u2013minute summary of the response paper.Professor Samuel and Armaan have been amazing, and they are so nice and understanding. You will also learn a lot about the research happening in Harvard labs from the visits and talks.",

    "course_description": "This graduate seminar course will expose students to foundational theoretical and methodological debates in the academic study of Black religions across the African diaspora in the afterlives of slavery and colonization. We will read canonical works and study the interventions and contributions of pivotal thinkers in the field (Du Bois, Hurston, Herskovits, Frazier, Cone, Long, Williams, etc.) while also examining their legacies and continued influence upon both Religious Studies and Black Studies, respectively. In addition to familiarizing students with a variety of approaches to studying the varied manifestations and articulations of Black religions (as phenomena, traditions, cultural practices, and aesthetics), the course examines the construction of the category of \"Black religions,\" ethical and political issues involved in the study of Black religions, and discourses and topics (slavery, African retentions, gender, sexuality, colonialism, etc.) profoundly affecting our changing understanding of Black religions in the contemporary period and reshaping our understandings of the field's intellectual history.Note: Course is by application to the instructor. Please provide a short paragraph answering the following: What is your year and course of study? Why do you want to take this course? What are your research experiences with regard to the study of Black religions?",

      "This is a wonderful course. Melanie is a great professor. Her course organization is incredible (really stands out as very organized with great course materials, slides, etc.) and her lectures and lecture slides are well explained, easy to follow and organized. Melanie is a wonderful lecturer. If you take the class, Melanie's office hours are very helpful and an incredible resource that you should take advantage of. The course has a little bit of a different, more mathematical flavor than your average machine learning course at Harvard (which can be a good/bad thing depending on your interests), but I really enjoyed seeing machine learning presented from this angle and learning about geometric techniques. If you are interested in the material, you should take the course! The course is accessible to undergrads with good linear algebra knowledge and CS 181 level understanding of ML and coding. I would say the listed prerequisites are accurate and you'll get a lot out of the course if you're coming in with that background. There are a lot of undergrads taking the course, so if you're looking for a first graduate course, this is a great class with a great professor and interesting material that should be accessible to you if you have the prerequisite background.",

Throughout the course, either individually or with partners, you will develop an independent project that explores the design of K\u201312 computer science learning experiences. Some examples of possible projects include: designing CS-standalone or cross-curricular learning activities and curriculum, building a programming language for novices, developing an annotated bibliography, critically analyzing policy documents such as curriculum frameworks and standards from around the world, or contributing to current K\u201312 CS education research initiatives.",

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! I don't usually write long reviews but I have to give KB and Brian their flowers. They are the absolute BEST teaching team and this class was the best I have ever taken at Harvard. They create a delightful classroom environment (warm, engaging, creative, relaxed, fun) and their focus on learning as a journey rather than a destination with set checkpoints allows you the space and freedom to fully explore your interests as you work on your semester\u2013long project. The work load is super manageable as class only meets once a week and depending on your personal project, you choose how much time you put in. And you end up putting in the time because the work is so fun! The weekly design cases are so interesting to read and the collaborative classroom culture allows you to participate in other people's projects and be inspired by their work as well. There are no tests or exams, just the semester long project, but the course has plenty of built in check\u2013ins and scaffolding to keep you on track. This class single\u2013handedly made me excited to be a CS concentrator again (burnout is so real) and introduced me to the Education Studies department which I will now be taking more classes in.

We begin by investigating the apparent triumph of Western liberalism in the aftermath of the Cold War\u2014what political scientist Francis Fukuyama dubbed \u201cthe end of history.\u201d How did this supposed victory of Western values confront new realities of economic stagnation, migration, racial conflict, and war?

Course topics include the fall of Communism and German reunification, neoliberalism and inequality, youth culture, social democracy and the welfare state, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010s migrant crisis, and the rise of populist politics. We consider texts by Angela Merkel, Lea Ypi, Jenny Erpenbeck, Michel Houellebecq, Joan Scott, Thomas Piketty, Tony Judt, and Timothy Garton Ash; music from the Eurovision song contest; television shows such as\u00a0NSU German History X; and films like the 1993 French drama\u00a0La Haine,\u00a0the 2003 German reunification comedy\u00a0Good Bye, Lenin!,\u00a0the 2013 Italian portrait of decadence\u00a0La Grande Bellezza\u00a0(The Great Beauty),\u00a0and the 2016 German comedy Toni Erdmann.",

      "This course is incredibly informative with a very in\u2013depth textbook that everyone should spend the time reading. Professor Gilbert is a very entertaining professor and everyone should absolutely attend his lectures as they are very interesting, lecture attendance isn't mandatory and recordings are posted right before the exam to review but you take the exams in the same lecture hall that the lectures are in and going to lectures greatly helps with remembering the material. Your grade is based entirely on the 2 exams in the course that are non\u2013cumulative, but there is an extra credit book club that would boost your grade by one step (B\u2013>B+ or B+\u2013>A\u2013) which is a very helpful boost given how difficult the exams are and it gives great insurance that you will get a good grade in the course. The course is graded on a curve (60% get an A, 25% B, 15% everything else) and the curve, being as generous as it is, really saves your grade. The median on the first exam was ~75% and on the second it was ~70% so the curve brought a raw score of a C up to an A which is incredibly generous. On both exams, I studied a ton because I want to concentrate in psychology and wanted to do well in the course and my raw scores for both exams were 82% and 80% so my curved grade was an A. I also did the extra credit book club which is a great opportunity to get basically free extra credit and I recommend everyone to do it because the extra credit is very helpful when there are only 2 exams making up your entire grade.For studying for the exams it is truly just memorization of the bolded terms in the textbook and the experiments discussed in lecture. There are a lot of terms in the textbook that you have to memorize so a good trick that I used was that I rewatched all the lectures and just highlighted all the terms that were repeated in both lecture and the textbook and just studied those which saved me a ton of time and it made me rewatch all the lectures. Overall, the course is amazing and a great time, for the exams just make sure you study hard, the curve is generous and the extra credit is very helpful. This course makes it entirely possible to get an A and although it may be more difficult in terms of what makes up your grade when compared to other intro courses it's absolutely doable and not super difficult overall. \u2013 MN",

      "Pettenuzzo was a great professor whose lectures + section materials were really helpful! Section was especially useful \u2013\u2013 would 100% recommend going each week even though it's not required (the bulk of what you need to know for the class, especially pre\u2013midterm, can be gleaned effectively from section with a good TF like Karen). Pace picks up insanely fast after the midterm though \u2013\u2013 I wish less time was spent on basic stat review material at the beginning of the semester so all the new content doesn't feel so overwhelming / jam\u2013packed post\u2013midterm. So make sure to stay locked in after the midterm! The textbook was also helpful for me to review content.Overall, course is super fair (just 6 weekly\u2013biweekly Psets \u2013\u2013 make sure to check at OH etc though because they're pretty strict on grading) and you get a lot out of it \u2013\u2013 econometrics is super cool and widely applicable throughout econ! You'll just have to put in quite a lot of time/effort to get there.",
      "This class is hard, but everyone knows that. Section was completely USELESS and all of the Tf's suck. Students would benefit if the section was mandatory and it was practice problems rather than useless material. Midterm and Final were hard, but to be expected. Pettenuzzo is really cool though",

Don't get me wrong, whatever class Popa teaches will probably not be easy. But that's the point. Some classes if you really want to learn, the instructor and the class are just subpar.

      "I LOVED GOV51. I learned a lot about quantitative methods to apply to social science questions, and the difficult material was made very digestible. Don't get me wrong, the material was challenging and complex, but I found the class super interesting. This class actually made me reconsider what I wanted to study because I loved the topics/possibilities in this area. Naijia, Jeremiah, and the course assistants were beyond helpful and dedicated to making sure you have the tools to understanding the concepts and succeed. The course staff definitely made the class great. The problem sets were difficult for me, but I was able to complete them by going to office hours and collaborating with peers. One thing to note is that the distribution of work is not very consistent: some weeks I would do 0 work and other weeks (like when we had a problem set, exam, or project) I would do many hours of work. However, the work is very manageable *especially if you go to office hours*. I also found the final project very interesting, though it was a bit difficult to apply what we learned. Although I don't feel like I have a super strong grasp of R, exposure to coding in R will surely be beneficial if I ever need to use statistical coding again (which I likely will because this class helped me realize that I want to pursue more quantitative social science or related field). HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you have any interest in applied statistics or working with data (even if you're not a Gov concentrator \u2013 I am not).",

      "Great teachers, too much homework. Noh \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8, Lindsay \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8, and You \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8 were all fantastic teachers. They all teach well, are approachable, and are understanding. I hope for the future 120B classes they reduce the amount of homework. We already meet every day. But in a typical Korean 120B week we had multiple vocabulary quizzes, an essay, a recording project with a partner, a one on one speaking practice zoom call, workbook homework (like 4\u20135 pages per), and of course every few weeks a lesson test. I only complain because I feel like a lot of the work was unnecessary and unhelpful towards progressing my language skills. Mostly everything about lecture and section was super positive. Section is super fun and more fun than lecture becuase its a smaller class size and so you have more opportunity to talk with your peers, etc. But that's kind of the point of section vs. lecture. Lecture they want to drill into your head like 2\u20133 grammar concepts and then section they want you to practice those grammar concepts with others.The vocabulary quizzes became pretty hard from 120A to 120B. They essentially became grammar quizzes and we all know grammar is harder than vocabulary to \"study\" for. 120B they introduced full sentence completion and more nuanced, \"trap\" grammar questions. 120A vocabulary quizzes were straightforward to study for and easy to bag 10/10s on but I found that in 120B they became complicated to prep for and I was getting 7/10s even though I put in the same studying effort as 120A. Overall I kinda had to take this class as I had already taken 120A in the Fall and planned to do 120B in back to back semesters. But if someone had told me in advance that the jump from 120A to 120B in terms of attention to detail and workload was a thing, I would've been appreciative.",

The vast literature produced by scholars in diverse fields provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe.

      "If you have to take this class, know that it is not as bad as people say. If you go to section and one office hours every week (e.g. I just went to Ted's every week), you will do fine. It is fairly easy to get an A if you keep up with the material and the midterm exams are fair, so I would not recommend taking it pass fail unless you're in your senior spring (note I took this along with 5 other classes \u2013 6 total). That being said, the final was very hard, and if you fall behind for a week it will cascade and make it harder to catch up. However, Ted does a great job of recording review sessions and office hours on top of class, so it is okay to miss lectures if you have other commitments and watch the recordings. Ted also really cares about the class, and his dry sense of humor can be very funny (once it stops being scary). He puts a lot of time and effort into the class, and you can feel it as a student. He is also super accessible outside of class. He is of course super super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject as well. If you do not HAVE to take this class, I likely wouldn't recommend it. I walked away feeling like I learned very little about chemistry. It did not really give me any fundamental understanding on a molecular level nor did I learn how to predict reactions, etc. I don't even feel much more confident reading papers about inorganic chemistry. On the other hand, Chem 20/30 were super useful and I felt like I learned a lot of practical skills and gained way more understanding during both those semesters.",

We will also seek to understand key data sets for research . At the same time, these are dynamic fields, with new topics attracting academic (and real world) interest.

Mooney ALWAYS approached students with utmost respect, and generated extreme enthusiasm for tissue engineering. I know from other BE courses that professors often don't have a lot of energy for teaching when they also do so much research, but this IS NOT the case for Mooney. Even amongst his busy schedule, he stays engaged throughout the entire lecture and every student presentation. Additionally, Mooney is very available outside of class, and always made time to check in when any group needed it. The main component of the class is the in\u2013class journal club presentations. These can feel very scary and challenging at first, but by the end of the semester I was much more comfortable discussing the journal club papers in front of the class. I know this will be very beneficial for my career, and I am super glad I built this skill now instead of later. I also got much better (and faster) at picking out the key points in scientific literature. Great course and great professor!",

We will examine these themes with close attention to their historical roots and their constitutional and theoretical origins, to their manifestations in our current political discourse. We will take up issues at the level of jurisprudence or political theory, but also as they arise in public controversies, or are settled in legal cases by the courts\u2014cases in which racial or gender equality are at stake, religious or sexual freedom, cases in which the nature and content of political speech are questioned, cases in which the imperatives of religious communities seem irreconcilable with public institutions, cases in which the nature and extent of punishment have been debated and the question of who deserves to be punished decided, and notorious public trials in which the national self-understanding has been shaped.\u00a0Our aim is to bring theory to bear, and down to earth, in each consideration (we will read Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish, and also examine prisons and mass incarceration).

It's a great class regardless of whether you plan to study more theoretical math or not.In terms of content, I would say it is pretty manageable especially if you have some background in abstract algebra (i.e. linear algebra or further) and/or proof\u2013writing, though definitely not a necessary pre\u2013req. Homework is weekly, a bit on the longer side (occasionally some rather tedious exercises) but quite straightforward (takes around 10 hours at most, and Harris is super lenient about extensions). The main textbook (D&F) and class content align pretty closely, so it is helpful to look at. The final follows very closely from homework so if you do well on psets/understand how to do the problems then you should be set! My only minor concern throughout is that we get feedback on homework quite late, though homework solutions are posted for reference which is nice. Overall a really good class :)",
      "Fake class unfortunately. Joe is a very illuminating lecturer, but he is hindered by a.) answering every question, even the extremely stupid ones, with 10\u201315 minute\u2013long tangents, and b.) not knowing what is on the psets and therefore covering topics completely out of sequence, sometimes covering material necessary for homeworks after they are due. These two things combined made me feel that, even though I would often leave with some kernels of useful intuition, attending lecture was on the whole a waste of time, and so I stopped attending after the first 2 or 3 weeks.Another issue I had was that the homeworks, while mostly fine, sometimes contained extremely tedious, useless problems for seemingly no reason (e.g. verify that these theorems hold for this group by checking all 20+ cases), which really gave me the impression that Joe had both not written the homeworks and also had no idea what was on them. By the start of finals, we had gotten back 2 of the 11 homeworks, so there was also no real way to gauge one's performance or level of learning in the class; I also suspect, writing this the day before grades come out, that our final exams were never graded or looked at. I understand that this is kind of just how math classes are at Harvard, but it really did not fill me with confidence about this course.Take if you love self\u2013studying and reading terrible textbooks. Or if you need to take this class as a Math concentrator. Otherwise, don't take.",

      "This is a requirement as an Economics Concentrator, but it should not be a dreaded one. If you choose a subject you are somewhat interested in, the readings can be very engaging. Even if it is not your top choice, there is something to be said about learning to read the type of economics papers you will encounter. There is a ton of reading assigned, especially for someone like me that is a math and social sciences guy. But as my TA said this is a lesson in learning how to skim as much as it is how to read economics papers. A 60 page research paper, in my opinion, has about 30 important pages and a few sentences that are relevant on the other ones. So not that bad. And the paper, if you actually start early, is genuinely fun. Meet with your TA about the code and get all your regressions and results coded out early. That way whenever you sit down to write its not actually an awful time crunch but more doable. And its like working out: hard, but feels awesome after your done. Take it with Shivram Viswanathan, if you can!",

We will also consider issues that connect musicology to the broader world. Emphasis will be on weekly readings of recent publications, brief writing assignments, and discussion.",

What is it to be human? Where are we going? Are we alone in the universe? And last, but not least, what are the dangers of becoming a multi-planet species? Life and planets are intricately linked through geological processes, chemistry, and ultimately, biology, all of which you will explore in this course as we endeavor to answer questions about our place on this planet and beyond. You will gain knowledge of some natural sciences fundamentals while exploring current issues in biotechnology and space exploration technology.

What did Franklin and others mean by republic, and why did he and so many others worry that it might be something hard to hold onto? This course will give you the theoretical basis and historical evolution of republics so that you can understand the American system of a democratic republic, now spread widely around the planet even as it is considered under threat. You will read Hamilton alongside Jefferson, Machiavelli alongside Montesquieu, and Angelina Grimk\u00e9 alongside Frederick Douglass. You will consider systems of governance in Republican Rome, medieval Europe, early modern England and France, Native American nations and the United States. The thinkers and founders you will read thought long and hard what freedom is, how to balance executive and legislative power, and why republics and democracies can be unstable. As a democratic republic, the United States places great faith in the capacity of voters to choose their rulers, who in turn make most of our policies. Is this faith misplaced? What is the role for virtue in a republic, and what is virtue? How does inequality undermine republican stability, and what might be done about it?Screen reader support enabled.",

      "I found the content of this course very interesting, but the structure of the course was not great. \u2013 I did not find that lectures were particularly useful, and found reviewing the posted lecture notes to be the most helpful way of learning the material. \u2013 However, section was very helpful and my tf was great at explaining concepts. The labs were sometimes tedious, but overall not bad. \u2013 My tf hosted office hours directly after section/lab time and I found it helpful to do as much of the psets as I could earlier in the week and then stay after lab for office hours to ask any questions I had. I also found SSN a helpful resource. \u2013 In terms of PIEs I found it helpful to make my reference sheet by scrolling through the lecture notes and taking notes mostly on bolded words (definitely make sure you know the bolded words) and important concepts, and then taking the practice PIEs and adding to my notes based on anything I found confusing/got wrong. I would definitely try to move fast on the PIEs \u2013 as someone who has never struggled with time on exams before, I found myself rushing on most PIEs and almost running out of time on some of them. The actual PIEs tend to be pretty similar in difficulty and content to the practice PIEs, so if you feel pretty solid on the practices I wouldn't be too worried about the PIEs.  \u2013 The lab write\u2013ups can be kind of annoying/time consuming, but I honestly would just recommend sitting down for a couple hours, locking in, and just grinding them out. They can seem daunting at first, but if you just answer the questions that they give you it really is not that difficult, just kind of tedious. \u2013 Some of the course content especially at the beginning is pretty repetitive if you've taken ls1a and/or ap bio, but towards the middle/end of the course it starts getting more interesting and I found some of the psets to be kind of fun. Overall I would recommend this course and I think there are definitely ways to streamline your experience so that your learning is most efficient.",

      "The readings in this course are definitely the highlight. They are well\u2013curated and very interesting! I loved the variety of sources, from those that are purely history of science, STS, or even Supreme Court decisions. While I think that the discussion\u2013leading is good in theory, I wish that Jasanoff was more involved in asking questions. Often times, the discussion questions were very niche and we didn't make it to discussing all of the readings. For how fascinating they are, I wish the discussions were more grounded in the readings. It might be helpful for the TFs and Jasanoff to lead a discussion in the first or second class for a model of how it should be done and what kinds of questions should be asked. But, often, the discussions felt quite divorced from the readings and it didn't feel productive. Additionally, the feedback in this course is very unclear. All semester, we were getting grades on the basis of a check, check plus, or check minus, which is hard to translate into grades. I liked that they sent a midterm participation evaluation \u2013\u2013 something similar for the overall course grade would be really helpful.",

      "My first course in AMO, Physics 175 was a bit of an odd experience. Long story short, the course really has the potential to be the best undergraduate course in the department, but there are many shortcomings to it that I think are impossible to overlook.\tLet me start optimistic. \tI am in strong belief that Physics 175 has some of the most if not the most interesting material out of any undergraduate physics course in the department. Studying both classical and quantum approaches to optics, with their various degrees of formality, all give tremendous insight with regards to both theoretical (seeing how the various levels of model simplification in classical optics make themselves amenable to the description of key phenomena of light) and experimental (studying the immense scope of applications of the simple principle of interference) considerations, as well as physical (thinking about the behaviour of Gaussian cavities, geometrically interpreting time evolution of superpositions of spherical harmonics) and mathematical (the multitude of natural and beautiful applications of harmonic analysis, most notably the duality between convolution and multiplication of functions) intuition. 175 is also one of the main undergraduate courses where one sees both classical and quantum theory in action, which both makes it an important history lesson, both in terms of the theory itself (seeing how one would go abouts forming true quantum analogues for our beloved classical objects such as the theory of coherent state solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator) and in terms of the experimental tools that quantum optics has gifted to us (notably laser theory, which is a wonderful playground for a lot of interesting ideas in the experimental side of physics). It has all the ingredients to be an absolutely beautiful segway into modern AMO that I am certain many students would find both fun and useful to take. \tSecondly, the problem sets in this course are absolutely the star of the show here. None of them are particularly long or overly bashy, and so are definitely not a huge huge time commitment, yet I feel like they are some of the most well\u2013constructed problem sets I have seen from any course I have taken at this school. Unlike certain other aspects of the course, they are written to appeal to a wide range of interests, and often are able to give tremendous amounts of important physical and mathematical intuition and to serve as an excellent way to make sure you actually understand what is going on in lecture. (The interference problem set deserves a special mention for contributing 100% of the intuition I now have for what Fourier theory actually tells us, despite the existence of several other courses in maths and physics that I have taken which have made absolutely pathetic attempts in comparison to do the same; doing the problem sets for the quantum optics unit of the course genuinely helped me stop panicking about the class and about whether I actually understood what was going on). The problem sets are relatively light compared to some other courses in the department but definitely not completely trivial \u2013 it can be pretty hard to figure out what to do when you're stuck \u2013 but they definitely make the course feel like a good bang for your buck. \tThirdly,  TF Lev Kendrick did an absolutely incredible job and has been a shining beacon for helping me clear up all misunderstandings I have had in the course. He is fantastic at gauging his students' backgrounds and re\u2013explaining the material in the course in a way that would maximally benefit them. I will recommend any course that he TFs.\t Onto the bad news.\tUnfortunately, I have not really been a big fan of Prof. Greiner's lecturing this term. He clearly is an incredible physicist with an absolute fortress worth of wealth in terms of physical intuition, but two main aspects of his teaching have kept me a bit apprehensive about the course. \tOverall, I felt as though the presentation of the material, although done in an order that makes a lot of sense, was rather disorganised. Prof Greiner's poor blackboard management makes lecture incredibly difficult to take good lecture notes from. If one's attention slips even for a short while, one can and often will find themselves completely and utterly lost about what is going on. The real highlights of Prof Greiner's teaching are the excellent snippets of intuition that he gives verbally during lecture, which would be perfect in an ideal world where everyone had perfect focus and was able to jot down exactly what he was saying in real time, but of course this is not possible. It also happens that Prof Greiner goes through all calculations incredibly slowly on the blackboard (this is especially notable during the second unit when long QM calculations seem to be a ubiquitous culprit with regards to ensuring that the student will lose track of what is going on conceptually), which thus makes it especially hard to catch the real takeaways every time he goes through a computation. Not only that, but if one attempts to look at the lecture notes he posts on Canvas to try and understand what happened, one is usually left disappointed as these are incredibly terse to the point where it's often difficult to even decipher what exactly he is trying to illustrate. All of this resulted in me spending more time finding out what was going on than actually trying to understand what he was saying, which made for a somewhat frustrating course experience.\tProf Greiner's amazing physical intuition is extremely beautiful to watch, but often his attempts to convey this intuition result in correspondingly huge losses in mathematical rigour. I'm all for presenting us with a clear setup of a problem or example followed by a clear statement of the final result if the computations involved were sufficiently routine, but Prof Greiner's lack of rigour made it sometimes quite unclear what it even was that we were trying to bash in the first place, which is not ideal when you're learning the material for the first time. Lev again was instrumental in helping me deal with this, and even helped elaborate some more on some of the relevant underlying mathematics (if you ever wondered what taking complex analysis in physics was useful for, I have finally found it to be used a nontrivial amount in AMO), but it was sort of frustrating waiting for section or office hours to clear this up nonetheless. I feel kind of bad complaining about this to be honest, as I am really grateful for Prof Greiner's focus on intuitive explanations \u2013 these get harder and harder to come by as you get higher up the department and knowing exactly what some of the maths is telling you definitely gets difficult in 175, but I just wished that there was sufficient rigour to make it clear exactly what his intuitive approach was trying to justify. \tIt really is a shame that Prof Greiner's genius was not conveyed to me as much as it should have been this term, but I think the issue might just be that currently the course is designed for people wanting to go into an AMO lab for summer/ term\u2013time research, when the course could be adapted to accommodate a larger range of backgrounds and interests. Having spoken to a few upperclassmen doing undergraduate research in AMO, they seem to all have really appreciated how much perspective 175 gives them in their lab work, and I am completely not surprised \u2013 I just think it so happens the course has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic introduction to AMO that would be received better by a much wider range of physics concentrators had it just been a bit more clear and organised, and I guess I am just somewhat frustrated that the course is not attaining its massive potential.\tAs usual, none of my physics department Q guides would be complete without a discussion about prerequisites, so here we are. I personally think that to gain a meaningful understanding of the course content, Physics 153 (or equivalent) as well as a solid first exposure to quantum mechanics would be ideal. The first of which I would argue is important as Prof Greiner does not really go very far into the theory of electromagnetic optics in 175 (stuff like wave guides are left completely undiscussed, for example) and it is also assumed that one has knowledge of D, P, H and M fields for example to talk reasonably about birefringence. Of course, quantum principles are essential for understanding the theory of quantum optics \u2013 I specifically did not recommend Physics 143A as I believe that to be an insurmountably terrible course whose horrendousness is not often realised until long after its completion; if that is your quantum background coming in (as was mine), you will be alright but be prepared to be horrified in 175 by how absolutely insignificant your knowledge and intuition of quantum mechanics would be coming out of that (which to be honest is probably a good character\u2013building moment, I just have a lot of residual resentment for it still a year and a half later). Haven't taken 15c so I can't really judge on how good that is as a means to prepare you. Essentially, if you have a decent working knowledge of QM, a knowledge of EM optics, and know a couple basic wave principles, you will be ok.\tAgain, a course that in my opinion has the potential to be the physics department catalogue's shining star, but currently with some very high highs and (in my opinion) some definite lows. Will still definitely recommend the course in its current form if you don't really mind the things I discussed, just so you could see for yourself how interesting AMO can be.",

The staff, especially my teacher, Dana Malhas, do an amazing job of synthesizing a very diverse class in terms of skill level. My class contained those with reading/writing backgrounds but no understanding of the language due to Islamic studies, students like myself who could speak but not write, and students who had absolutely no Arabic experience. I was so impressed by how Dana made the class fun, interesting, and useful for everyone in it. If you have no experience, you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the letters and sounds, but there is SO much in class practice that you can do it. There are also lovely gatherings and outings during which you can practice your Arabic and any level of interaction is encouraged at those events. I had an amazing time in this class and it brought me a lot closer to my Arabic\u2013speaking family; I can\u2019t recommend it more! There is SO much support for you; do not be intimidated by the fact that it is a difficult language. It is difficult, but also beautiful and worth the effort. I made so many friends in class, too, because we do lots of talking and getting to know each other! Take AA!!!!!",

I know as an incoming freshman, I wanted to know what the student got with their perspective, which is why I am putting this here. So here's what I have to say:\u2013 If you have not taken economics before, like me, get ready to lock in. At first, it is going to seem like common sense, but it picks up quite quickly. The midterm will be more difficult then you think and be ready for that. All of the other qreports from what I read before coming was that it was going to be pretty easy, but please please please study. \u2013 If you mess up on the midterm (any students), DON'T WORRY! I didn't do amazing on the midterm, but I pulled out an A on the final, which saved my grade. It is possible, I promise! If you didn't understand the midterm that well, please go back and understand it. It will come back into the future concepts and you will only get more lost if you do not put in the effort immediately. \u2013 If you did well on the midterm, do NOT let off the gas pedal. I know students who got high A's on the midterm and get C's on the final. The class does get harder and it is not as easy as other people say it is.\u2013 Do your problem sets with one of those office hours that goes over the entire problem set. For me, this semester was with Jack Kelly, which was so beneficial for my pset grade. Psets are worth 25% of your grade and this is an easy way to help you get that A at the end!\u2013 Finally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do the Unit Review Programs. These are easy 2% extra credit bonuses on your final grade! This is what got me my A (I think). It literally could be the difference between an A and an A\u2013, so please please please go. It's like one hour out of your week, every two weeks. Just go and get your extra credit!",

If you do this, you WILL do poorly in the class. This is not the class to mess around. It is a hard course and you must put in the time and effort to do well, that is the hard part.

This seminar will examine and interrogate both literary and journalistic dimensions of medical writing. The investigation will be chronological, beginning with \u201cclassic\u201d narratives by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Kafka, and then moving on to more contemporary authors such as William Carlos Williams, Richard Selzer, Oliver Sacks, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors\u2019 behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms. The presentation of illness in journalism will be studied in selected readings from the New York Times\u2019 and Boston Globe\u2019s Science sections, as well as periodicals like the New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harper\u2019s, and the Atlantic Monthly. The members of the seminar will analyze how the media accurately present the science of medicine or play to \u201cpop culture.\u201d The seminar will study not only mainstream medical journalists, but so called alternative medical writers such as Andrew Weil and celebrity health voices like Gwyneth Paltrow. Patients with different diseases will be invited to speak to the members of the seminar about their experiences. Students will try their hands at different forms of medical writing, such as an editorial on physician-assisted suicide that would appear in a newspaper and a short story that describes a personal or family experience with illness and the medical system.",

The writing assignments were often in the form of op\u2013eds (something that I didn't know until this course) which made them more fun to write and they often prompted you to consider your own feelings on a particular topic as it pertained to medicine, illness, or legalities.  I learned a lot this semester about different ways to consider readings as well as how to write my own.  The in\u2013class discussions of the readings were always engaging, and everyone always had the opportunity to participate and provide their own insight.

      "Where do I begin...\tMy second\u2013favourite course of all time, Physics 210 was a truly fantastic experience. I came in to the course with high hopes and little intuition, just purely interested in the course to learn about \"the most beautiful scientific theory of the 20th century\", and let's just say it did not disappoint. \tLet's start with the star of the show. Prof Jacob Barandes is an outstanding lecturer who clearly cares an incredible amount about his students and physics education as a whole. His endearing and respectful personality, excellent board\u2013work and fantastically engaging presence just made lecture an absolute joy to be in. Combining this with how much he cares about presenting the historical development of the physics and his emphasis on instilling within us a genuine, intuitive conceptual understanding of the material has resulted in GR lecture actually giving me goosebumps and leaving me in awe of the material on very many occasions. Informal chats with Prof Barandes at the end of lecture were great opportunities to gather further perspective on the material, learn about his fascinating research and hear what follow\u2013up questions other students have, leading to a wonderfully vibrant academic climate in the course that I will look back upon fondly. The course staff in general were excellent, but a well\u2013earned special mention and thank you goes to TF Rui\u2013Zhe Lee, for his great patience, knowledge, humility, kindness and approachability. \tThe material itself really lives up to its legendary status in physics. I really enjoyed the discussion of relativistic field theories that leads up to the derivation of the linearised Einstein Field Equation in unit one, which I understand to be something that is uniquely covered in Jacob's course, as it really nailed home the similarities in construction between Maxwell's Electrodynamics and General Relativity. The third unit (on the physics of curved spacetime), was the heart of the course and possibly my favourite section of any class I have ever taken \u2013 the final two weeks, an incredible collage of the astrophysical phenomena that the theory allows us to describe, was genuinely instrumental in keeping up my excitement and curiosity for physics through what is normally an exceedingly stressful time of the year. Overall, there are one or two lectures that are in my opinion need a little rethought, and depending on one's level of mathematical maturity the middle section of the course might feel a bit out of place pace\u2013wise, but otherwise I am in strong agreement with the course's current structure. In general, Physics 210 just does a brilliant job of acting as a very necessary confluence of all the little streams of knowledge flowing in a student of theoretical physics' mind (Courses on Analytical Mechanics? Electrodynamics? Quantum Mechanics? Pure Maths? Pop science exposure (desperately in need to be rephrased rigorously)? They all combine here to make one beautiful unanimous whole).\tPhysics 210 is in general known in the department as a course in which the coursework is famously \"bashy\". Whereas I will not attempt to dispute this, I will say that Professor Barandes does make the experience far less painful than it would otherwise be by making most of the quite involved computational problems be key steps in results that we establish in lecture, so that even when we are in agony bashing tensor calculus on a blackboard late at night in Jefferson, we are constantly reminded of the significance of what we are doing each time we review the course material. In addition, unlike in some pretty infamously glaring examples of physics courses on this campus, one does find that in Professor Barandes' problem sets that staying close to one's organic mathematical intuition when solving problems does give a clearer picture of what is going on \u2013 always is a great plus to see a course be built upon solid conceptual understanding in all its aspects. Just a heads up \u2013 please do have a TF around when you try getting off the ground for the first time with Einstein notation, I was fortunate to have it be carefully walked through the first time around which was very helpful as I got the chance to integrate it very naturally with my structural intuition of linear algebra quite well early on before things started becoming too involved.\tAs is typical in my Physics department Q guide reviews, I feel a need to give my take on the prerequisites of the course. I am of the opinion that one will benefit the most from Prof. Barandes' Physics 210 having previously done Physics 151 and 153, and have the mathematical preparation of Math 22 or equivalent. None of my recommended prerequisites are formal requirements of course (besides like basic mechanics including Newtonian gravitation, and of course Linear Algebra and Several Variable Calculus \u2013 just a heads up these are most definitely completely necessary), but I am of the view that 210's narrative will make the most sense for those with the background I have just described \u2013 the physics discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the language of classical field theory with Maxwell's Electrodynamics being frequently revisited as the de facto example, and the mathematical discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the notion of an abstract vector space, for example, and will present mathematical ideas at the aforementioned level of exposition. Minor detail, but I will however put a word against having done a differential geometry course beforehand, however, as one would put themselves at risk of not enjoying the middle unit of the course as much as they would otherwise \u2013 not saying that one would find it dull (I have heard that Prof. Barandes' GR teaches Math 136 better than Math 136 does, and I can imagine that this is true), just an \"I wish I learned things the other way around\" kind of feeling if you get what I mean. This is definitely specific to Prof. Barandes' 210 though \u2013 I have heard that other versions of the course tend to do a less thorough treatment of the mathematical side of the subject, in which case it would probably make more sense to disregard what I just said. Definitely speak to more alumni of the course to get their views on this however, as I feel like this is both a subtle and a subjective thing to discuss \u2013 I'm just presenting my view on the matter.\tOverall, a phenomenal course that I would recommend to everyone interested. I strongly believe that every student of physics will be at a stage in their education where Prof Barandes' GR would be an excellent addition to their catalogue; if you capitalise on this and take the course at your \"proper time\" (no pun intended), Physics 210 truly has the potential to blow your mind every lecture and remind you of how exciting life can be as a student of our wonderful subject.",

Beyond analysis of key musical and lyrical characteristics of gospel, this class gives attention to the religious and sociocultural contexts that inform gospel composition and performance. Consequently, this course is a musical introduction to African American Christianity. Finally, the global resonances of this music are explored to situate the music in the context of global Christianity.

If you are looking for more of a small class experience, you want to go to lecture, and you think psets would help you understand the material, I would take this version.

      "A Frustrating and Useless Economics CourseThis course was an absolute disaster from start to finish. It is shocking how little thought seemed to go into making this class a worthwhile educational experience. Here are just a few of the glaring issues that made this class worth avoiding if possible:Problem Sets: A Marathon of TediumThe problem sets were absurdly long, often nearing 100 questions. This would be bad enough if they were meaningful, but they were anything but. Instead of fostering understanding, they devolved into tedious calculation marathons that added no real value to mastering the material. To make matters worse, many of the problems were structured to cascade: if you made a single mistake early on, it snowballed, guaranteeing you got several more questions wrong. This setup punished even minor errors and discouraged actual learning.Lectures: A Waste of TimeThe lectures were utterly unhelpful. The professor\u2019s slides were crammed with irrelevant math and equations\u2014stuff that didn\u2019t even align with the level of understanding required for the course. Rather than clarifying or simplifying concepts, the lectures left students more confused. If you walked in hoping for clear, concise explanations, you walked out disappointed (and more stressed than when you came in).Exams: Unreasonably Difficult and ArbitraryThe midterm and final exams were very difficult\u2014not because they tested mastery of the material, but because they were riddled with random, nitpicky questions. It\u2019s absurd to expect students to recall obscure tidbits from readings or parse the meaning of some minor detail on a graph buried in the lengthy textbook or one of the many readings assigned. This format doesn\u2019t measure understanding\u2014it\u2019s a scavenger hunt designed to trip students up. Add in the multiple\u2013choice calculation problems, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for disaster. A single small math error meant getting multiple questions wrong. This is an economics course, not a math competition!Overall Experience: Frustrating and PointlessUltimately, this course completely failed to fulfill the purpose of an economics class: TEACHING ECONOMICS. The relentless focus on excessive calculations and arbitrary details detracted from any meaningful engagement with broader concepts or critical thinking. Instead of leaving the class feeling enriched, I walked away frustrated, burnt out, and deeply disappointed. Every review I read on the Q before taking this course proved accurate, showing that the professor and the economics department clearly have no interest in improving this course or providing an enriching experience for future economists. If you're reading this and considering taking this course, don\u2019t be surprised if nothing changes. If you\u2019re taking this course as a requirement, it\u2019s doable, so don\u2019t stress too much. However, don\u2019t expect to gain much from it\u2014it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll walk away feeling like a more confident macroeconomist.",

The first is to develop your skill at recognizing the myriad ways in which language can be used and misused as a tool for persuasion, by teaching you a variety of techniques drawn from formal logic, linguistics, and the discipline of argument-mapping. Master this skill, and anytime someone attempts to persuade you of something, you will be able to understand the structure\u00a0of their attempt so deeply that you need not fear manipulation, but can decide\u00a0for yourself\u00a0whether you wish to sign on to the conclusion they want you to reach. Our second goal is even more important: we hope to show you how you can \u2013 and why you\u00a0should\u00a0\u2013 construct your own arguments with such clarity, honesty, and logical transparency that the people you direct them to will be optimally placed to decide, for\u00a0themselves, whether and why they ought to agree with you.

To begin to explore this question, we discuss key theoretical issues and illuminating examples that begin to sketch out an approach to linking language, culture, and society. Specifically, we consider the following problems: How is language use a kind of social action? (It is something we do; it has social effects.) How does language organize and provide access to shared concepts and beliefs? (It has something to do with the way we collaborate, socially, to represent, reflect upon, and think about the world.) How do speakers think about and reflect upon language, and how do these reflections affect how they use it? (We have presuppositions about what language is and rely on these notions to orient to and situate ourselves within social worlds).Throughout the course, we develop a set of powerful analytical tools for studying both language and culture and, ultimately, for defining their role in social life.",

By the end of this course, you will have the linguistic and cultural foundations necessary for your adventures all\u2019italiana. You will be introduced to contemporary Italian culture through a variety of topics from everyday life (family, shopping, food, fashion) to the arts (music, literature, cinema). Materials include films such as La meglio giovent\u00f9 and cultural readings that explore the history of modern Italy (i.e., 1968, Italian Terrorism, the mafia, etc.). Assignments include short creative writing and oral projects, cooking activities, and multimedia presentations. In-class assignments will be supplemented with individualized conversations with native speakers of Italian to further enhance your understanding of the diversity of cultural perspectives within Italian communities.",

      "Lecture material was kind of confusing at times but reviewing during section and office hours was helpful. We spent a lot of time on derivations which I guess is nice if you're super interested into the why and how of certain formulas that we learn, but I wasn't. That wasn't on the exams though so I appreciated that but some psets used info from the derivations so we definitely didn't learn them for nothing so if you're interested in derivations there's that. The TFs were great at letting us know what the key concepts were to review while studying for exams which was useful because we cover a lot. There's no final in this course which was much appreciated, just two exams (a midterm and a 'final' that was only on the 2nd half of the course on the last day of class). The practice tests were so so so useful in preparing and the grading, at least for this past year, was generous which was nice given the difficulty of the exams. The problem sets were sometimes very difficult but having a good pset group and going to office hours should put you in a good place to do well. I personally wasn't super interested in statistical thermodynamics (and this course didn't change that) but it taught me what I'm supposed to know and I didn't suffer that much which is all I was really hoping for. There are actually a lot of chemical applications which was helpful to contextualize all of the math and stats. Overall this was actually one of the better classes of my semester and I'd definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill the physical chemistry requirement. Prof Zhuang was a great professor (and actually being IN the lecture hall for lecture will do you a world of good in terms of understanding the material, forming a pset group, and just generally increasing good faith between yourself and the teaching staff/Prof Zhuang) and Carl and Vaibhav were great TFs. I didn't have a strong math background (only took 21a/equivalent my freshman fall and took this course my junior spring) so I got frustrated at times but the TFs were really nice in explaining some math concepts at office hours and otherwise I was fine so don't be too worried if you don't have a stats/math background.",

      "This is the worst course that I've taken at Harvard. The flaws are numerous: 1. Should not be taught in IRAF. Modern astrophysics is done in python, leaving this course is very outdated.2. Course structure: it was always very unclear what tasks were required/graded, and most assignments were submitted through email...?3. Final project is very undirected. No assignment requirements or rubrics are provided, despite it almost entirely determining our grade.4. Final project support is minimal, but not at fault of the TFs. After completing data reduction, groups are left to do data analysis on their own (and all groups chose to do it in Python, as this is the modern coding language of astrophysics), but because each group is doing a different type of project, the TFs are not able to help very much. 5. After spring break, class time becomes equivalent to office hours, but attendance is still mandatory.6. Introductory lectures do not offer any educational value as they are, largely, covering material that is a prerequisite for the class.7. First half of the course is spent going through IRAF \"documents,\" which are outdated, riddled with typos and errors, and impossible to go through individually. They do not incentivize learning as they require dependence upon TFs \u2013 you get too bogged down in the outdated software to learn anything meaningful.8. I have not received any written feedback, in any form, for a single assignment this entire semester.The spring break trip to Arizona is pretty fun, especially if you have friends in the class. However, with the numerous glaring issues that this course presents, I do not think that it is anywhere near worth it.If you are considering taking this class to satisfy astro requirements, take any other course in the department before this one. If you are planning to take this class for some other reason, don't.",

      "This is literally the best STEM class I have taken in my time at Harvard as a junior in applied mathematics. Here are the reasons why:1) Ample study material. The course is accompanied by a very clear and well\u2013written textbook that has been generated specifically for this course over Eli's many years of teaching APMTH 120. This is paired with a DropBox of coding examples for most of the topics you need to be able to replicate (which you should note as a useful resource for homework assignments). You will never need to scour for random resources or PDFs on the internet, as I have for so many previous classes. These materials tell you exactly what you need to know, with clear explanations or examples for each topic.2) Extremely fair quizzes and exams. You will be provided with a clear list of topics to master, as well as access to every past practice exam covering that same material. Eli doesn't believe in surprises on exams (though it would have been good to have a heads\u2013up about the block power method this year...). The TFs are clear and responsive when you request help or need additional clarifications. If you decide to prepare in advance, you have every ability to do well.3) Highly applicable and relevant content. It was rare that we studied a topic that seemed unrelated to direct applications in data science. This is genuinely an applied class.4) Useful and achievable assignments. All the problem sets have clear instructions, as well as ample help available via office hours and Ed. They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head\u2013banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure. The TFs under Eli are fantastic and responsive. There are a lot of windows for office hours, and they will take time out of their busy weeks to write clear responses to your stupid questions on Ed. They'll even do things like make supplementary materials or videos to explain trickier concepts. You'll never feel lost at sea.6) An awesome professor. Eli is a wonderful guy \u2014 I laughed out loud at least once per lecture \u2014\u00a0and he's the perfect person to teach this class.Don't get me wrong, the course is not necessarily *flexible* \u2014 there's a strict lateness policy, and the homework assignments come like clockwork every week, including spring break \u2014 but it's consistent, realistic, and the course staff will provide all the support in the world for you. I'm a burned out junior in AM who doesn't really feel like taking mind\u2013numbing and/or poorly organized upper\u2013level technical classes anymore, slogging through random proofs, learning about abstract concepts I don't care about, or spending hours debugging in whatever awful programming language my professor happens to like. Most classes I've taken at Harvard involve at least one of these attributes, typically several, but this class had none of that. It was clear, helpful, and the right degree of challenging, and I feel like the value I got out of the course scaled linearly with every hour of work I put in. I learned a lot of content in spite of myself. I'm really glad I took AM 120 and hope you take it too.",

    "course_description": "Continuation of Sanskrit 102AR. In the spring semester of the Intermediate course, students learn advanced skills in syntax, morphology, compound analysis, and metrics. Students learn how to analyze k\u1e5bt and taddhita suffixes, recognize a variety of poetic meters, categorize and take apart compounds in greater detail, and determine the various senses in which k\u0101rakas and vibhaktis are being used. In the final month of the course, students learn how to interpret commentarial and expository prose (\u015b\u0101stra). In addition to developing the discrete skills above, students read and discuss three different Sanskrit texts. We continue the story that we began in the fall semester\u2014that of the encounter between Arjuna and \u015aiva in book 3 of the Sanskrit epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Then we study Bh\u0101ravi\u2019s Kir\u0101t\u0101rjun\u012bya, a sixth-century k\u0101vya (poetic) composition based on that epic story. Finally, students practice their commentary-reading skills by interpreting select portions of Mallin\u0101tha\u2019s Gha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101patha, a fourteenth-century commentary on the Kir\u0101t\u0101rjun\u012bya. Overall, the intermediate-level Sanskrit course enables students to interpret Sanskrit texts in three major genres: epic, poetry, and scholarly prose. Students expand and strengthen the skills in reading comprehension, grammatical analysis, and vocabulary retention that they developed during the first year of study. Students will be able to dissect and describe nominal compounds, verbal forms, poetic meters, and morphological and syntactical features of Sanskrit words, sentences, and verses in greater detail. As a whole, the course prepares students to participate in Sanskrit language and reading courses at the advanced level. Most lessons involve collaborative work among students. No auditors will be permitted. Enrolled students must take the course for a letter grade. Please note that this course includes a required weekly review session with the Teaching Fellow at a time to be determined within the first two weeks of the semester.Prerequisite: Sanskrit 102AR.",

      "If you are considering this course as a freshman and are mentally prepared for the challenge (and imposter syndrome lol), I say go for it. I took 124 as a freshman with the following preparation, and I was able to do pretty well in the course with a cracked pset group, begging for answers at office hours, regular section attendance, and a lot of grinding:High school math up to multi and linear but they were not rigorous at allSome small coding projects in high schoolMath 22a with Cliff TaubesCS50Self\u2013studied discrete math over winter break based on the CS121 websiteNO competition math or competitive programming in high schoolNO CS120 or Stat110I don't think the amount of preparation you have coming into the class is super important as long as you are comfortable with math proofs, know discrete math (more or less), and know how to code. The biggest challenge in this course is how quickly you can process new information and how much time you can spend on the course \u2013\u2013 it is very fast\u2013paced, so you will have a lot of very difficult information thrown at you in a very short period of time. If you are able to either learn quickly or put in the effort to understand each of the topics, not taking Stat110 or CS120 will not cause you to fail this course.My advice for future students taking this class:KEEP UP WITH SECTION EVERY WEEK! This is super super important. Sections help you understand the algorithms conceptually, understand what the process of running them looks like, and learn relevant information for the week's pset. There have been countless times when I was completely lost after a lecture and then everything clicked when I went to section. The 124 TFs are really good teachers. Take advantage of that. Find a section that works well with your learning style and stick with it. If you absolutely have to miss a week, make sure you watch the section recording.GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are invaluable in this course. Make sure you go to them to ask questions about the pset and inevitably to beg for the answers.MAKE SURE YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND YOUR PSET ANSWERS. In my opinion, it's okay to work with a super cracked pset group and leech off of them/office hours for some pset answers. But it is SUPER important that you understand the solution and why it works. The psets are designed the way they are for a reason. They teach important conceptual topics/problem\u2013solving strategies. The intuition behind them is very helpful for a general understanding of topics, and variations of pset problems may come up in exams. (One of the finals questions this year was pretty much just a reduction to an algorithm we had to give in a previous pset).MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FALL BEHIND. It is very easy to fall behind in this course, and it's very hard to catch back up when you do. If you are confused about a topic after that week's section, make sure to ask questions about it or figure it out as you work through the corresponding pset problem. I think understanding an algorithm conceptually is the most important thing, because once that makes sense, everything else will (more or less) fall into place after a lot more thinking. This will also help with problem solving on exam problems.CHECK AND USE ED. Ed is the platform we use to ask questions about lectures and psets. If you have a question, don't be afraid to use Ed. Either someone else already asked that same question or a TF or Prof will give you a very good answer. Also check what people ask about pset problems it can give you hints lol.Also we had a very good late\u2013day policy this semester, so make sure you're utilizing those to keep yourself sane but also budgeting them so you still have enough by the end of the semester when all of your classes are hella busy.You will likely be pulling all\u2013nighters to finish psets and you will likely feel a lot of imposter syndrome. I felt the same, but I feel like taking this class was 100% worth it. It's a grind, but the concepts you learn are so cool and important, and you will look back and realize how much more knowledge you've gained through just one class. You belong in this class. Good luck!",

      "this class was actually a continuation of grandma's thanksgiving dinner \u2013 last year you were so full that you never wanted to take another bite of food again, but after a good nights sleep you wake up hungry and yearning to go back. i went into this class with great expectations because this semester promised to touch on some of the modern concepts and problems in qft and the standard model, and it did not disappoint. this class just begins to touch on some of the modern ideas used in high energy, and I feel like i have a good base to start exploring more into the stuff that people are currently doing. back to the analogy, this was completely in the same spirit as last year's thanksgiving dinner, in the sense that halfway through the roast turkey you suddenly get hit with a wave of drowsiness and you cant really eat anymore. but this time it feels even worse than last year. as usual, the course got pretty heavy after the first few weeks, but this time i would say it was a more sustained sort of difficulty that persisted through the entire semester after the first few weeks. again, i felt that the best way to really learn the material was by doing psets, and even though they were biweekly, they were involved enough that it would keep you busy for the whole 2 weeks inbetween. as usual, relying on the textbook and the tf was absolutely essential to completing everything on time \u2013 Arindam was great and gave us lots of help during OH, which was greatly appreciated. At the end, the course reminded me of thanksgiving dinner again, when everyone would start gathering and telling stories, but on occasion some of the older people would start randomly throwing shade at literally everyone on the dinner table. Final presentations were interesting to sit through because everyone presented on really interesting stuff, and it gave us a good idea of what doing research in high energy theory even begins to feel like. but during every single presentation, prof schwartz was quite critical of each presentation and really drilled us on our familiarity with our projects. its very intimidating at first considering that some of us might be very new to presenting, but in retrospect it really is good criticism, and its good to help us get accustomed to the kinds of questions that people will ask. what really stood out to me is that at the end of the drilling, prof. schwartz would still commend each group on their effort and reassured us that we did a great job despite the difficulty of our topics. this in my opinion is what made him such a great teacher, and what made this class bearable and enjoyable to look back on even though the concepts were not the easiest to understand.",

He's not the clearest lecturer in the department and sometimes he makes strange notation choices, but on the whole I never felt like lecture was too hard to follow. Just be aware that it's often his style to state a result, derive consequences from the result, and only then go back to prove the statement.  It can make the line between remark and proof a little blurry, but once you pick up on it it's not a big deal. Also, there were only 4 homeworks all semester and when Prof. Kisin says the exams should be completely straightforward if you do the homework, that's pretty much his way of telling you the exams will mostly be homework questions.

This is likely the only project you will get to design fully and implement, and I'm so happy and proud that I did it. Econ 985 specifically is a great course. It's low\u2013stakes, because the thesis grade replaces the course grade that you get, and all of the instructors sound great. Kiran was the absolute best, hands down, but since she's not teaching a thesis seminar next year I won't waste time telling you how wonderful she is.

These dangerous ideologies often masquerade as environmental consciousness.While contemporary discussions frame such rhetoric as a reaction to the growing awareness of climate change, it has deeper historical roots, particularly visible in American religious writings. Lest we forget that religion (and race) were central to the ecofascist manifestos espoused by the perpetrators of several tragic events: the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where a gunman targeted Muslims during Friday prayers at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Center; the 2015 mass shooting of Black churchgoers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas that targeted the Latinx community; and the 2022 attack at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. In the manifestos, the shooters identified as ecofascists whose mission was to protect and preserve white Christian nationalism in the wake of climate disaster.The manifestos accompanying these attacks have brought greater visibility to ecofascism today, compelling us to examine its historical roots and current operations. Is there a longer history of American religious ecofascism? How can we characterize this history, and what insights does it provide into the functioning of ecofascism in contemporary society? How have communities resisted ecofascism?",

In this course, we will focus on computational properties of interpretable machine learning methods, such as faithfulness or stability. Assessing methods with respect to these properties may allow us to rule out poorly-performing approaches without the need for expensive user studies. By categorizing methods by their computational properties, we will also be able to start thinking about which methods might be useful for a specific context.

      "This was overall a very informative course in interpretable ML. I think it's also a good opportunity to practice the ML research process through the course project (for context, I am an undergrad).Strengths of the class: The project checkpoints provide a lot of opportunity to get feedback and input, so there really aren't a lot of surprises when you turn in your project. I think this was a really well done part of the course, and Finale did a great job giving feedback. Class presentations where you could get feedback on your project were nice, though I question how engaged many students in the course were during these presentations and ultimately I'm unsure of the quality of feedback I got from peers, but this is less a criticism of the course/course staff and more just a reality of student attention in project presentations. The depth of discussion in the course I think was really impressive especially considering the size of the class. The course staff did a great job of trying to get people interested and engaged in discussion, and during the paper discussions I think people were really engaged and had a lot of good ideas. I learned a lot from the discussion part of the course. I personally think Finale is a good lecturer/presenter as well, provides excellent feedback and steering on the projects in office hours, and is detail oriented, precise, and thoughtful.Weaknesses: I'm unsure how important some of the interpretability methods covered in the course will continue to be as models get larger and more complex, like foundation models. Specifically, I would have liked to see more content in the course on mechanistic approaches to interpretability beyond one class. Also, though it is impressive that Finale (1) kept the course enrollment uncapped and (2) managed to at least simulate a close knit discussion environment in such a large course, it is unavoidable that when a course is this big it's not the same as a small little seminar, so I would keep this in mind. One suggestion for the course staff is to implement an Ed discussion board, where people can ask questions about the content, homework assignments, readings, projects, course logistics, etc. I think a lot of courses benefit from this and do a really good job of it, and I know it is a burden on the course staff, but I think this would be a really good thing to do and frankly I was disappointed that this is one of the first CS courses I've taken without an Ed discussion board. In terms of workload and grading: Finale said herself at the start of the semester this is a pretty chill class, and I wholeheartedly agree. I think you get out what you put into it though, and you want to focus on doing a really good project and not letting all that work catch up to you during reading period. I think they could have been more transparent in terms of grading at the onset \u2013 there was an announcement about how grades would go down toward the end of the course, and I think it would have been better to say that at the start. I think for a graduate course the grading scheme they claimed they would use was harsher than I would have expected going in, as they said A and B range grades, though the project feedback is designed to get you in that A/A\u2013/B+ territory, but really most graduate courses in CS have a grade distribution much more generous than this if they're really handing down B+'s. In the end though I think the grading was fair and reasonable and I wouldn't be intimidated by the course workload or grading at all, but do put in effort especially into the project, and really the more you engage in discussion and the course content the more you'll get from the course.",

The small class size means that it was really easy to get familiar with everyone, and Pia really encouraged open discussions and exploration. Class is 2x a week, no additional lab or discussion sections. The workload was practically nonexistent outside of class other than a few short readings, a short midterm project, and the final project (which is when you might really have to invest time into the class / come to the lab during non\u2013class hours, based on what question you want to study). I ended up doing a solo project while most people worked in groups, which Pia and Alex were super supportive of, and helped me with planning the components and making sure that they were feasible to complete within the allotted timeframe. They absolutely encouraged students to dig into what interested them. The classes were also filled with lots of delicious fermentation experiments, many of which are very reproducible at home! but maybe not in a student dorm lol. The field trips to breweries, labs, etc. were also super interesting! I was also thesising during the semester, and this was an absolutely great class to balance with that workload and other more time\u2013consuming stem classes. Overall, absolute gem for anybody and everybody, and I can't recommend this course enough, even just to hang out with/talk to Pia and Alex on a regular basis!",

      "LS 50 is a truly transformative experience. Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes' Theorem!). It's really satisfying seeing how the material from the spring builds upon material from the fall \u2013 all the science you learn really *integrates* together. For example, linear algebra is the *basis* for Markov chains which *feeds forward* into neural networks and then suddenly dynamical systems is back to provide a *stable* foundation for models of action potentials. There is so much interesting material in the spring \u2013 I especially enjoyed Markov chains, protein structures, and computational sequence analysis. My one note is that the linear algebra crash course is very fast so it might be helpful to prepare for that. You really won't find another class like this. Not to sound dramatic, but LS 50 has the power to change the way you think and approach problems, and an important part of this comes from having the experience of the entire year. Sure, in LS 50A Bayes' Theorem might just sound like a fancy name for two way probability tables and what even is a prior, but when you actually put it into words and apply it to hypothesis testing in the context of sequence analysis, it suddenly becomes concrete and relevant. who knows, this might become some arrival\u2013esque thing where you start to think of your life in terms of ls50 material \u2013 there's enough of it to go around.LS 50B is a chiller course than LS 50A \u2013 easier psets and exams (and no stat mech) \u2013 and by the spring you'll already have had a whole semester to get accustomed with the idiosyncrasies of LS 50, so that altogether makes for a more relaxing experience. This semester is less about trauma bonding and more about bonding over being in LS 50 together and realizing that time is coming to an end.But obviously, the biggest reason to stick with the course is for the community. The LS 50 community is so special and was a significant part of my freshman year \u2013 and while it's not immediately apparent, the truth is that the class is really instrumental for building and maintaining friendships. Daily meetings, late night psetting, lab karaoke, and post lab Berg meals go a long way toward forging connections and core memories. Also, you get to partake in designing class merch which is so much fun. Truly, through \u2013 the course staff, the CAs, and your classmates are what make the class special. And assuming that you've already taken LS 50A, you already know how kind, available, supportive, and all around amazing the LS 50 course staff is \u2013 all the more reason to stay. If you're still on the fence, I highly recommend speaking to them to figure out what's best for you.I cannot stress enough the value of staying for a second semester of LS 50. The content, the connections, the community \u2013 there's so much to gain from continuing on. And the spring is much less stressful than the fall, so you'll be alright. You'll do great in LS 50Bby any means necessary. \u2764\ufe0f",

Also you don't really need to have taken that many classes in math before to feel fine in the class (I had taken up to 101 and the 21s). Also no exams is epic",

If you take this class, just be prepared to devote a lot of time per week, nontrivially more so than other language classes. You will learn a ton of Hebrew within one year (again more so than other language classes), which is the point of the class, but the class has a hard time respecting the fact that you have other things to spend time on. The 9am is also rough. You might think that you will just deal with it, but thats what I did and simply having a 9am everyday made my year that much harder. Not a fault of the class itself, just a fact.  However, I must say that if you do go into this class prepared for the things I listed above, the class itself is a good experience.

What kinds of governments are there, and could be? Why do civil wars start? In this course, we will examine such areas using the theoretical framework and analytic tools of political sociology. We will survey exemplar studies and consider different ways of conceptualizing power: from the micro level of the family to the macro level of geopolitics. Theoretical works are combined with practical applications and illustrations in specific national and historical contexts. Through quizzes and section discussions, students will acquire proficient knowledge of the central themes, methods and empirical concerns of political sociologists.

Plus, the class makes an effort to apply the chemistry concepts to broader discussions around climate change and energy usage \u2013\u2013 sometimes, the content doesn't really line up, but it's still cool to have a course that makes the effort to not only focus on pure chemistry. The learning curve for this class was also not too bad, as any previous knowledge that was needed was briefly summarized in class and not too bad to learn. That being said, I did take AP Chemistry before this, and I definitely think a bit of a chemistry background will probably not make you hate your life in this class. The sheer amount of resources and support that was provided for the class was also great \u2013\u2013 I especially found PSL group coaching to be helpful, and I appreciate the amount of resources dedicated to supporting students. Section was also super helpful \u2013\u2013 I learned most of the content there, so make sure to go. I also liked that we got an exam drop, so that relieved a lot of stress when studying for the exams, even though we have three midterms and a final. One thing is that the lectures were often a bit hard to understand and to follow what was going on, which became especially challenging later on when the material got more difficult.

      "The course is pretty disorganized in my opinion. I took it because I had to, as many others who took the course did, but it could definitely be structured better. Joost is super cool, but does not have any lecture slides, lecture recordings, and doesn't write very legibly. I really encourage him to record his lectures in the future. The midterms and exams are infamously difficult with the averages usually being a failing grade. However, the course should be curved, TBD currently on how fair this curve is but I scored right around average for the most of my exams. TFs aren't the best either unfortunately. We can never get through more than 1\u20132 questions per office hours, and I feel like they often struggle to interpret the answer keys. Even more, there are no practice exams for any of the midterms or exams. We are given a random assortment of practice questions that the TFs put together and for two of the exams, these were literally released within 24 hours of the exam... To be honest it didn't matter that much though because the content didn't match up super well for any of the exams either. The content of the course is pretty foundational for engineering majors in my opinion, but the course is taught a bit dysfunctionally. Avoid the course if you can take another course for your requirements, but find some good pset friends if you must take the class.",

Editing gives us the power to manipulate time.For the first half of the semester, students will be introduced to a new technique each week, and will be given an assignment to start in class and finish before the next one.

      "This class is great!!! Yes, it is difficult, yes you may once or twice find yourself on the verge of tears at office hours, but it is totally worth it. The only thing to focus on is the psets, no bells or whistles, so it's super straightforward to know what you need to do each week. I would usually do a first pass of the assignment on Friday and work on it on the weekend, and then go to office hours on Monday to figure out where I was off, so Monday was usually the whole day spent on this, and then fix up a couple things Tuesday before submitting. The TFs are super helpful and friendly (Shoutout especially to Josh and Liana, they are the best!!!!!!) and they are committed to getting you to the finish line, so as much as there's difficulty, I never doubted that I could do it because they were so helpful during office hours. Also students are really collaborative explaining how to get started if you don't know how to start, so it's a great class to form a pset group.The psets are highly interesting!!!!!! The pset questions nicely fit together, so once you figure it out, it's super satisfying!!!!!!! Palpable sense of accomplishment every week. That's what made this course so interesting, learning so many new methods each week and analyzing data in a way that felt transferable to real life things. Highly recommend for AM\u2013Bio and anyone who is up for a bit more of a challenge that will pay off. I also finally understood coding and feel much more confident creating my own functions / outlining bigger sections of code. Of course, now there's chatgpt to debug, but I think this course does a great job of taking elementary coding knowledge you might have from just like,,, being alive in the 21st century and giving you the training you need via pset scaffolding to make it useful. Def consider your overall courseload, but this is a must\u2013take for AM\u2013bio, Sean is a great, dedicated, and personable professor, and the TFs are gold. You will learn a lot, it's totally worth it!",
      "This course was extremely difficult for me as someone without much math or coding background. It is advertised as a class which is accessible to those without much background, but this is NOT true. The assignments will be extremely challenging, and the lectures will not explain concepts on a basic level, but will assume you already know stats. Some will say there is a large \"learning curve\" at first, and then it will get easier \u2013 this is not true because new statistics concepts get introduced every week. The lecture notes are confusing and very wordy and it is often hard to piece together what is actually expected for each assignment. The office hours are semi\u2013helpful but if you do not  already have an understanding of math and coding, you cannot get the level of help you actually need.",

      "Take this course if you have any interest in prints, be it intaglio or 3d printing or somewhere in between. First: Jennifer and Matt are huge fans of each other, and the way they navigate their conversations about printmaking gives you a firsthand perspective on how art history and artmaking are disciplines that are construed as different, but largely overlapping. Second: the people in this class are selected for the interdisciplinary perspective they might offer to printmaking questions, and so you're guaranteed to emerge with at least one out\u2013there, wacky angle on the print tradition and print futures that you might not ever be able to encounter outside the highly free, cross\u2013disciplinary, encounter\u2013based discussions we have. Third: the course is extremely time\u2013consuming\u2014you enact the practice of spending way too many hours in both the studio and in HAM, allowing you to understand the practical considerations of why most people just specialize in one discipline. The amount of time required to become at least functional in some of the printmaking techniques introduced in studio + the amount of time required to be able to identify those techniques and theorize about them in master prints will sum to a huge chunk of your week. The only point of improvement I would recommend for the course is that, especially at the end of semester, it felt more like an AFVS course than an HAA course, and lost some of its interdisciplinary charm. I wish we had had one more class section in which we took a birds\u2013eye view on what the two fields could learn from each other, and whether printmaking is a good frontier for the two disciplines to begin taking first steps towards joining again: i.e. modern printmakers must know the tradition and the techniques of print.Moreover, you should take this course if you're looking for a truly open environment where you can be as experimental as you want to be, in theory and in practice, with the full support of two brilliant and extremely kind and supportive professors.",

[During my year, there were a couple lab members/guests that were getting or had gotten their education in Israel and were doing or had done psychology research in Israel. Pretty much nothing came up directly about the current actions of Israel/Israeli government, but if you foresee conflict arising around that subject or think it inherently violent to engage in large systems within Israel in these ways, I suggest finding a different lab. ] That being said, it is a flexible lab and there's a lot of freedom to learn and grow as a psychology researcher.",

    "course_description": "An introduction to Middle Eastern Studies focusing on the modern period (19th and 20th centuries). Lectures will be broadly sequenced according to historical chronology but will be thematically organized. They will provide some historical context for each topic examined, as well as present specific examples through primary sources, visual sources, and numerical data when relevant. This course is designed to give students an overall good grasp of the history of the modern Middle East and of some of the major themes in modern Middle Eastern Studies. Students will critically engage with some of the most important topics that resonate in that area of the world. We will cover topics such as reformism, economic development, colonialism and nationalism, authoritarianism and democratization, sectarianism, culture, gender, literature and the arts, as well as the role of religion in politics. Most of these topics, in one way or another, will speak to the construction of nation-states in the Middle East and to the challenges they have been confronting. This is not a survey course. In particular, it will not be exhaustive in its coverage of the region in space or time, and in its coverage of topics. Students in search of a specific topic, country, or period are strongly encouraged to take a look at the syllabus prior to enrolling to make sure their specific interests will be covered. Assigned readings will consist of primary and secondary sources. Students will be exposed to first-hand accounts by protagonists in the history of the Middle East (primary sources) as well as to the diversity of approaches that the scholarly literature (secondary sources) has taken across disciplines, e.g. anthropological studies, quantitative analysis, philology and textual studies. The larger aim of the course is to develop students\u2019 critical thinking in dealing with the history, cultures, politics, and political economies of the contemporary Middle East.Required for all NELC concentrators in The Modern Middle East. This course is primarily for undergraduates.\u00a0Graduate students must request instructor\u2019s permission before enrolling.\u00a0There are no prerequisites for this course.",

The course will emphasize the entire pipeline from writing a model, estimating its parameters and performing inference utilizing real data. The first part of the course will focus on linear and nonlinear probabilistic generative/regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, Poisson regression), and algorithms for optimization (ML/MAP estimation) and Bayesian inference in these models. We will play particular attention to sparsity-induced regression models, because of their relation to artificial neural networks, the topic of the second part of the course. The second part of the course will introduce students to the nascent and exciting research area of model-based deep learning. At present, we lack a principled way to design artificial neural networks, the workhorses of modern AI systems. Moreover, modern AI systems lack the ability to explain how they reach their decisions. In other words, we cannot yet call AI explainable or interpretable which, as a society, poses important questions as to the responsible use of such technology. Model-based deep learning provides a framework to develop and constrain neural-network architectures in a principled fashion. We will see, for instance, how neural-networks with ReLU nonlinearites arise from sparse probabilistic generative models introduced in the first part of the course. This will form the basis for a rigorous recipe we will teach you to build interpretable deep neural networks, from the ground up. We will invite an exciting line up of speakers. Time permitting, we will provide a model-based pespective of the building blocks of modern language and image generative models.",

I really enjoyed taking this class with my fellow undergrads because subir was so memeable that this course became very fun even though the psets were not fun at all. the material was very important to know for condensed matter, but there is an implicit requiremnt that you already know quantum field theory before taking this class. Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things.",

Ireland), and the Rwandan genocide; and 3) a research and writing workshop emphasizing students own work.

The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time. Readings will include classic papers on development, textbook chapters that provide overviews of specific developmental stages, recently published research articles on genetic inheritance, selected contemporary children's and young adult literature, personal memoirs, and short stories written about childhood.",

    "course_description": "Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, \u201ca criticism of life.\u201d But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: \u201cnon-fiction.\u201d At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction. This class will disinter the essay from its comparative academic neglect, and examine the vibrant contemporary borderland between the reported and the invented. We will study the history of the essay, from Montaigne to the present day. Rather than study that history purely chronologically, each class will group several essays from different decades and centuries around common themes: death, detail, sentiment, race, gender, photography, the city, witness, and so on. In addition to writing about essays \u2013 writing critical essays about essays \u2013 students will also be encouraged to write their own creative essays: we will study the history of the form, and practice the form itself. Essayists likely to be studied: Plutarch, Montaigne, Hazlitt, De Quincey, Woolf, Benjamin, Orwell, Camus, Primo Levi, Barthes, Baldwin, Sontag, Dyer, Didion, Leslie Jamison, Knausgaard, Ta-Nehisi Coates.",

      "English 185 is a fantastic course for concentrator and non\u2013concentrator alike. I personally am a joint CS and Math concentrator (but am doing an English secondary), so I feel that I can \u201csee both sides of the veil,\u201d if that makes sense. I have a few diffuse thoughts. First, the reading list in this class is absolutely excellent. You read a good dose of the \u201cclassics\u201d (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of \u201cmodern picks\u201d (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood\u2019s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all\u2013time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi). Second, Prof Wood is really quite an amazing lecturer. He has built a career doing \u201cliterary deconstructionism,\u201d and so it\u2019s a treat listening to him break open a piece. I do think the lectures near the end of term fall off, however; he has less to say about some of the packets of modern essays. Finally, a word on this class\u2019s difficulty. It really isn\u2019t a huge time sink, and you can skate by if you want to without doing much reading. However, the beauty of English 185 is that the readings are actually manageable\u2014so you will get so much more intellectual richness out of this class IF YOU READ! Also, the workload outside of reading is fairly light; it\u2019s just 2 essays. However, these are supposed to be good pieces (by the standards of an English concentrator, not by the standards of your gen\u2013ed TF)\u2014and that is a nontrivial task.",

      "This is a great class for learning things you don't get anywhere else in the Harvard physics curriculum. You get to learn how to use lab equipment for a bunch of really neat experiments, and honestly it's pretty fun. I would strongly recommend it to other physics concentrators, although that's probably not that relevant since you have to take it anyways for honors. That said, even if you don't need this class, I think it teaches really valuable lab and writing skills.Now, the warnings... You need a good lab partner, and not necessarily your best friend\u2013\u2013\u2013you need someone who will do work. Also, it is a big time commitment. Tu/Th, 1:30 to 5:30, but often you need to stay until 6 to finish a measurement, not to mention the writing and planning you need to do outside of class. Don't expect to get good grades on the first try, either; you will have to do revisions for all of your papers to fix even very minor things to get an A. Is this annoying? Yes. Does it take a lot of time? Sometimes. Is it reasonable? Yes\u2013\u2013\u2013it makes you a better writer. The point is, some weeks you will probably be spending around 20 hours working on this class. With an awesome lab partner, maybe less. With a crappy lab partner, definitely more.Go in excited about the experiments. It's a really fun, really useful, and really unique class in the physics department. Good luck!",

This class will probably make or break if you want to pursue EE. If you spend time to understand what is happening in the labs, you will literally be a circuit god. You can build anything, do anything. Super cool hands on experience in lab! The labs are pretty challenging/intensive though. The psets are very long and difficult. Start them early and do them with friends. Also, don't pick the lab section that happens during Wednesday Mega EE office hours. You're going to want to go to those OH.

She is also very accessible outside of class, and I would definitely recommend that you go to her office hours!! This class is definitely not easy, but you have a really good support system with Professor Coleman and the TF Ashwin. You will succeed in class and take a lot out of it if you do the readings and the readings journals regularly and participate in class discussions. It is a fairly big class compared to other anthropology classes, so it was very interesting and enjoyable to listen to different perspectives and ideas during class discussions!! Read the assignment guidelines carefully and make sure that you know what is expected from you before writing your essay in terms of the approach, content, and writing technique. This class is a great introduction to social theory and anthropology, and the reading list is very diverse and comprehensive! I would highly highly recommend that you take this course!",

Both ethnographic and theoretical readings serve as the material for class discussion and the foundation for ethnographic fieldwork.At once a crash course in ethnographic theory and ethics, and a practicum in qualitative methods, FM97 weds scholarly inquiry and academic study to practical experience in cultural documentation and personal involvement with local tradition bearers and folk communities. Guided by an interdisciplinary collection of texts, students will have the opportunity to study folklore from the ground up, not only through an academic lens, but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local communities. Throughout the semester you will be invited to develop skills in qualitative research, cultural documentation, proposal design, interviewing, and the arts of interpretation as you try your hand at fieldwork and ethnography. By examining folkways, expressive culture, traditions, and performances, and interrogating their import in the daily lives of individual and groups, we will aim to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and lived experiences, between the academic institution and the vernacular world. Ultimately, this course aims to bring \u201cthe folks\u201d themselves into the center of the academic study, discussion, and debate. And it aims to give you the tools to help amplify and illuminate their voices, traditions, practices, and lore.",

      "This is a wonderful class! Even if you are not a Folk&Myth concentrator (like me), this can be a wonderful way to get out of your comfort zone and try something new (or to fulfill your Divisional Distribution requirement).Pros:\u2013 Interesting content from which you learn a lot. I was interested in folklore before taking the class, but to me, this just meant folk songs and dances. This class delves much deeper into the field of ethnography and you get a totally new understanding of folklore through this prism. I feel I really learned a lot about the world in this class\u2013 Engaging class discussions. Be sure to do the readings so that you can meaningfully engage in the discussions (or at least understand what is being talked about). This class is rather discussion\u2013based (not really a lecture style) so you really need to do the readings to learn and have a fun experience\u2013 Assignments are very fun to do and make you get out of your comfort zone. I had so much fun taking field notes and engaging with different places in Cambridge, events, and folk groups. I had a lot of fun attending a performance and engaging with my chosen folk group. I am really glad this class pushed me to have all those experiences \u2013 Deadlines are flexible. This saved me on many occasions. Sarah is very understanding and really tries to make the class as low\u2013stress as possible\u2013 SARAH IS WONDERFUL!!! She put a lot of effort into the class and made it very interesting and engaging. She also has a lot of experience and is very knowledgeable on the subject. I was so interested whenever she entered a more lecture\u2013like mode and shared her experiences and thoughts!Cons:\u2013 The has a heavy workload. There is a lot of reading and an assignment to do each week. These are all fun and interesting, but still, it takes a significant amount of time (perhaps especially if you are more of a STEM than a humanities person). However, I felt that all the work was insightful and needed. This is just a warning if anyone is looking for an easy elective. I would say that this will definitely be an amazing experience for everyone but you should have the heavy workload in mind",

Regardless of whether or not you\u2019re an experimentalist/going for honors/going to grad school, I would recommend you give this class a shot since being able to perform these experiments is really a special opportunity. One small downside was that the introduction to the experiments given by the lab wiki/manual could do with some updates and improvements, since a lot of time you might have to do a substantial amount of outside reading and research to understand the theory/experimental background. The highlight of this course was the teaching team: Prof Silvera and Yacoby are the best. Prof Yacoby pushes you to deeply understand the relevant physics behind your work, and some of his explanations and lectures in this course have been the most enjoyable and illuminating expositions I\u2019ve ever experienced. Prof Silvera is very sweet and caring, bringing liquid nitrogen ice cream and pie on the last day to share with the students. Joe and Jieping though, are the true stars. Not only are they genuinely some of the kindest and most caring folks I\u2019ve met here, always wearing a smile and brightening the mood at the lab, they\u2019re also so knowledgeable and helpful about all the experiments.

      "So, if you're reading this, you're deciding whether to take Math 21b or Math 22a, and you've stumbled across the forgotten APMTH 22a.Let me list you out the pros and cons.Pros:\u2013\u20131 PSET a week, around 8\u20139 problems (with multiple parts, that in total probably amount to 30 questions overall). Due every Friday at 11:59pm. This is obviously much better than Math 21b's 3 PSET's a week.\u2013\u2013No proofs like in Math 22a, although most of the time you spend on PSETs will be answering True or False questions that require justification. Best to do this numerically/algebraically or with a counterexample, if you really want to avoid relying on the Theorems and any associated proofs. If you're taking a course like CS20, CS120, or some other proof based class, then you should already be growing your mathematical maturity in those classes, and that should be enough.\u2013\u2013Supposedly, partner PSETs. Although, as of writing this for 2024 Fall, Margo Levine is covering for the professor that is on sabbatical, and removed this benefit.\u2013\u2013Supposedly, 80% of your grade comes from the PSETs. Margo also changed this into a standard grading percentage. If the regular professor is back, both of these will be benefits for you.\u2013\u2013PSETs do not take extremely long. I was able to start and complete many of them after I finished my STAT 110 homework (due every Friday at 5:15pm). So it took me around 7 hours in total just to complete it all. Not bad for not visiting office hours and not showing up to lecture.\u2013\u20134 late days. I was quite grateful for this.\u2013\u2013Exams are quite easy. Do the homework, and you will understand most of the content you need for the exams. I only studied by doing a single practice exam the night of (12am\u20136am grind).Cons:\u2013\u2013Classes are at 9AM MWF. Attendance is required, although attendance was already going to be required in Math 21b anyways (not sure about Math 22a). No engagement during lecture, everyone is silent because it's a 9AM class. Does lead to a few moments of awkwardness, but not the end of the world. No shade to Margo as a person or even as a teacher, she is genuinely great at both. \u2013\u2013Because this class is so small (maybe 30 ppl? can't tell cause maybe half the class actually shows up to lecture), you won't get as much support as you would in the alternative classes. Decide if this is worth it. Ultimately ChatGPT can  often be a substitute for learning these topics if you really need it.\u2013\u2013Also as a consequence of the small support size, you will be getting your PSETs back very late. I am still waiting on my PSET I submitted 2 months ago as of writing this, although solutions are posted.\u2013\u2013You learn Matlab. CS majors, this is not a language you are likely to use in your career. If you have absolutely 0 programming experience, I could imagine you struggling quite a lot.  Perhaps this is useful for engineers, but I doubt it. I don't know if this will last for the next semester, but Margo was kind enough to allow us to use Python instead of Matlab (which, if you've taken CS109 or even if you're just generally ok with Python, you will want to do this). Python code for this class gets a little messy because of numpy and matplotlib having lengthy notation, but it makes it a lot easier to code with for those who are more CS\u2013inclined.\u2013\u2013You may need to watch a few videos on linear algebra on YouTube to actually understand what you're doing. I'd suggest the Essence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown. Short videos, no actual math, just watch them as recaps on what you're doing when you perform the operations you learn in class (especially for what a basis is). This is all I can think of. I think the cons of the alternative classes outweigh the cons of Math 22a. Pick the lesser evil. Save yourself the effort. Otherwise, when you're drowning in your work for the alternatives, you can think back to this Q\u2013guide comment I made and wish you would've chosen the easier path. Good luck, soldier.",

      "This course was a really fantastic introduction to stem cells, the diseases they treat, and the patients these diseases impact. The most valuable portion of each lecture is the patient presentation, in which we see how a disease and its treatment uniquely impact the individual and their quality of life. Most presenters were compelling, as well, with some variation from week to week. The section portion of the course involves student presentation of assigned papers and discussion. The papers selected each week tended to be very strong, though I do wish some were more recent. Assignments are not at all painful and entail: a short weekly write\u2013up, one presentation in section, a final paper (divided into an introduction, midterm, and final over the semester). Feedback on the midterm paper, which includes the instructors, was mixed. Be prepared for feedback that doesn't address the salience of your argument, but the beliefs of the instructors on whether the argument is sensible. This is a bit frustrating, as the feedback doesn't require elaboration or evidence; thus, you might hear \"X won't work\" with very little explanation. The feedback from the section leaders, conversely, was all very helpful! They tended to focus on weaknesses of the argument and its organization with clear suggestions for improvement. Be sure to meet with your TF about the papers before submission. They are very willing to help. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an introduction to stem cells! It isn't perfect, but the unique focus on the patient experience is incredibly valuable and not something that many students get the chance to experience during undergrad.",

Topics range from the structure of Native-American economies to the economic consequences of the Civil War; from the impact of capitalism on gender relations to the changing structures of American businesses; and from the position of the United States in the world economy to the role of the government in channeling economic development. Boston merchants and Georgia sharecroppers, enslaved cotton growers and reforming statesmen, workers at the Ford assembly line and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs will all appear in the story. The course will put particular emphasis on the global context of American economic development and situate it deeply in political and social changes. Ultimately, students will gain an understanding of how the contemporary capitalism that so powerfully shapes all of our lives has emerged over the course of several centuries, and how the tools to understand the history of American capitalism can be applied to understanding our contemporary situation.

We covered the entire history of its development in the US since colonization began in 1492. You will learn some cool things and I guarantee there's a little something in it for everyone. I would recommend this course with reservations though because it is very history heavy and very focused on the economy (granted given the name), so if it's not something you're devoted to learning it can get boring pretty quickly. In general, there were some not very interesting days. Also, there are many deliverables (including weekly reading summaries, and end of lecture reflections), butt you get used to it.

      "Great class! Definitely more difficult than I was expecting, though. The exams were not hard in the normal sense, more just challenging because they were weird, at least compared to other physics classes. It was hard to get partial credit on several problems, and the topics seemed a bit niche. The exam reviews were super helpful in highlighting what would be important, though. Also, there were no practice materials for the exams, which made it even harder to know what to expect. I would not say the exams were unfair, but they were hard to prepare for in a way that maybe could have been fixed. It is possible that future iterations of the course, if taught by Morii, will have better materials because they will have exams from this year to use. P\u2013sets were also a bit weird and sometimes a little niche, but they were not as grueling as I have found for other physics classes, and office hours were extremely helpful. Lectures were effective, if occasionally moving a little fast, and the lecture notes provided were pretty thorough. Labs were definitely a substantial time commitment, but I found them to be far more enjoyable than in previous 15\u2013series classes. The teaching staff cares a lot, which really made a difference. I came into this class with no particular affinity for physics (chem student) and walked out with a much greater appreciation for physics and a chem/phys concentration.",

      "This class was much better than I expected honestly. Lectures were very interesting and Prof Cikara was super super knowledgeable on everything she spoke about, she made the class feel engaging, and she always helped us feel like we were doing well.Lab (section) was extremely helpful because we were able to work on our final projects during that time which saved our group time outside of regular class hours. Also, having the TF answer our questions immediately during lab helped save time with troubleshooting. We also learned how to use Qualtrics and reviewed R basics which definitely assisted with the final project.Readings were interesting but honestly should be skimmed because we only really use them during lecture and for the Slack discussion posts. Also, during lectures, Prof. Cikara always mentions the key takeaways and quotes from each reading so that\u2019s useful.The final project was so fun if you have a good group. Make sure to have fun with your topic. As someone who did a survey instead of in\u2013person trials, it is much easier to set up in the long run. Make sure to test your qualtrics survey MULTIPLE times before publishing it. Also, communicate well with your group and don\u2019t let anyone take control.The assignments were really chill since they were graded based on completion, but make sure to do them to your best extent because I got all my feedback early on and by the time my draft was due, I didn\u2019t need any more revisions before the final project. It saves you time during reading period and finals to avoid having to write most of the paper if you have it done already.Lastly, the exam was good if you payed attention to the prerecorded videos or during in person lecture. I took notes during lecture in person and didn\u2019t watch the videos and got a good score. I wasn\u2019t stressing like the people that skipped lecture most days",

      "I personally liked this course. I thought the content was interesting, the lectures were engaging, and the section component was great. I definitely think about IR in a different light now. Here's a list of pros and cons for the course.PROS:Chaudoin is extremely engaging as a lecturer and super passionate about the material.The material straight up is not difficult. There's an entire section of a lesson dedicated to reading a regression table and determining whether the result was statistically significant. Other lessons are about basic game theory (stag hunt, PD), the bargaining model of war, etc. The tests were not super difficult. The averages were always around 90. Each test question / assignment is graded by the same TF, so grades are usually pretty fair. Katie is awesome. So friendly, responsive, and passionate about the material. Seriously made this class 100x better. CONS:The assignments did seem to be graded kind of harshly (but feedback was pretty good). Chaudoin sort of has a high school teacher mentality sometimes where he calls people out for not paying attention in lecture or not doing the readings. While I understand this must be frustrating as a professor, this is college and I sort of assume that lecture time is my choice to do with as I want (as long as I don't disrupt others). I then suffer the consequences of not paying attention. Chaudoin would often call people out and embarrass them for not paying attention to lecture, which I thought was unnecessary and uncomfortable. For reference, I never was one of the students who were put on the hot seat for this. The cutoff for an A this year was quite harsh at 95% (although nobody got below a B\u2013, and most got either A's or A\u2013's). The Pick a War Assignment. You'd think group projects would be better at Harvard. Nope.Overall, great teaching staff, great content, great class. I'd definitely take it if you're a Gov concentrator.",

    "course_description": "The intersection of environment and health is by necessity an interdisciplinary focus. The most promising advances in lung biology and respiratory disease are resulting from teams of scientists with diverse disciplinary training, including biology, medicine, engineering, and physics. In addition to a strong foundation in a specific discipline, the ability to recognize and act upon opportunities presented by outside disciplines is a crucial skill. This course is designed to train scientists to approach lung biology and respiratory diseases with an interdisciplinary perspective, in particular by bridging the gap between life sciences and physical/engineering sciences. With a focus on laboratory sciences and on mechanistic levels of understanding, course materials will cover 3 main problem areas: asthma, air pollution, and lung infection. The course consists of weekly course-meetings (lectures and case-studies) plus weekly research seminars from the physiology program. Students will gain skills in recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different disciplinary approaches applied to pulmonary sciences, in designing interdisciplinary experiments effectively, and in interpreting interdisciplinary results critically.",

By juxtaposing literary works from authors writing both within the boundaries of the United States and beyond, we will be able to make connections between them that highlight both their common sovereignty struggles and shared utopian visions, but also keeps in view the many meaningful differences in how Native American and Indigenous aesthetic productions perform the work of future-making.",

I think that there was a little too much focus put on trying to develop an alternative story of Appalachia than the one that is commonly told and not enough focus on the things from that narrative that are accurate, but the content was still interesting and informative.",

You learn so much stuff about 20th century Korean history and culture and consequently gain a much deeper understanding of the cultural forces that shape Korean popular culture, both then and now. Even for people who have no interest in K\u2013pop or Korean dramas, I think this class would be equally as fulfilling if you have even a slight interest in modern Korean history. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that both the professor and TF were South Korean, I think this class was able to convey a much more nuanced and accurate perspective of Korean culture than you might get in other EAS classes. Section is honestly just an hour of having the most fun and insightful conversations. Workload is super light, especially relative to the amount of knowledge you get out of the class.

      "This course introduced me to a range of books I probably wouldn't have read otherwise, but am grateful that I did. It was a really interesting opportunity to read contemporary translated literature and many times, talk to the translator to ask about their process and the prize selection in general. Class discussions were always interesting and everyone seemed very engaged with the material. However, I think that one major area for improvement would be handing back feedback in a timely manner. Our first essay was due in early March and was not handed back until the day before our last class period. The delay in feedback made it difficult to show consistent improvement based on feedback.",

In many of these processes the actual steps taken by biological systems are not currently understood. Further, even the outcomes that are being realized by these processes are not well understood. In general, current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step-by-step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications, it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them. Computer science therefore offers a top-down approach to understanding what could possibly be computed in biology, and how. In this course we shall pursue this computational complexity approach, whose origins go back to Turing and von Neumann. Emphasis will be on evolution and neuroscience, but other topics such as development will be also discussed. Research papers that address some aspect of the complexity question, whether by mathematical analysis, computer simulations or experimental findings will be discussed.",

Technological innovation is all around us, and new\u00a0possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not\u00a0only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point\u00a0of modifying the essence of what it is to be human.\u00a0While ethical considerations enter\u00a0prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics.

The EV transition has far-reaching repercussions from emissions to macroeconomic impacts to national security and poses substantial challenges in the rapid development of new supply chains.\u00a0 In this seminar, we will study the intersection of EVs, the energy transition, environmental science, policy, and economics. The current pace of change is dramatic but has roots going back 50 years to early U.S. environmental regulation and efforts to reduce dependency on Middle East oil; auto has been a critical element in trade policy back to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Policy is pivotal today, in the U.S. and overseas, in terms of determining the pace of EV adoption, how supply chains develop, and how fast they evolve.\u00a0 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) enables faster EV adoption through tax credits for EV production and purchases.\u00a0 Technological progress, especially in battery technology, will be critical in the path forward.\u00a0 We will analyze a range of EV issues including those highlighted above as well as charging, health impacts, equity, and international market differences.",

There is so much valuable information to grasp from the readings, and the discussions that you get to have with your peers are priceless. Les is such an amazing instructor and is really what made this course a gem. You are essentially given full creative freedom for the final project, and it is such an enriching experience to work under his guidance. Take advantage of office hours because he will open doors to new ways of approaching your idea that you'd never even considered before. The readings are not only interesting, but the load is very manageable as well and it would only take you a couple of hours of focus per week to be able to make the best of class time. If you are a student like me who is also interested in pursuing medicine, I feel that this class was essential to my understanding of how the foundation of medicine was developed, and think that any good doctor should know this history. This discussion style course was 3 hours, but I swear it always passed so fast because of how engaging the discussion and class activities are. 10/10 I could not recommend it more :)",

    "course_description": "Anton Chekhov was the last of the major writers from the \u201cclassic\u201d period of Russian literature, producing his distinctive short stories and plays during the twilight years of the Russian empire. Chekhov was formed by this cultural-historical moment, and he depicted the effects of modernity on Russia of his own time, treating a wide range of characters from different backgrounds. But Chekhov has long since transcended this original context. He is celebrated as one of the greatest short story writers of all time, and his plays are performed more frequently around the world than those of any other playwright, excepting Shakespeare. Once you\u2019ve spent time with Chekhov, he will stay with you forever.Chekhov\u2019s work can be funny or very sad, and sometimes it is both at the same time. Much of Chekhov\u2019s meaning lies in the details, and in what is not said as much as what is made explicit. This seminar seeks to sharpen your skills as a discerning reader and interpreter. We will also go beyond the page to explore Chekhov\u2019s work as produced on stage and screen, beginning with his partnership with Konstantin Stanislavsky, the director of the Moscow Art Theater, where Chekhov\u2019s plays were first enthusiastically received. Since then, Chekhov\u2019s plays have been produced across a diverse range of approaches, which we\u2019ll sample. More broadly, we will consider Chekhov\u2019s life and times and explore his on-going reception inside Russia and around the world.",

How has control over oil\u2014the single most important commodity in the world\u2014shaped the nature of power, politics, and environmental and social life in the twentieth century?

This interactive seminar will address these and other questions by examining the political, social, material and cultural history of oil. Given the centrality of oil to modern life, control over this prized resource has resulted in a complex and often violent history. We will thus look at the ways in which the political economy of oil has shaped the rise and fall of empires, the fate of nation-states, the making of the economy, the nature of class, gender, and racial discrimination, and the production of historical knowledge and the built urban environment. By moving between primary source documents and films, novels, multi-disciplinary scholarly analyses, in-class discussions, and written assignments, students will learn to be principal investigators and thereby sharpen their own critical interpretive abilities. While this seminar will address global trends and processes, the primary focus will be on the Middle East.",

What is the motivation for these claims, and why is their fervor often in inverse proportion to the economic value ascribed to music by society?\u00a0 Our entry into the subject is both via several famous philosophers and via contemporary reappraisals in a recent publication, The Oxford Handbook of Western Music and Philosophy.",

By analyzing texts from Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm\u2019s influential collection Children\u2019s and Household Tales, comparing them to similar fairy tales from other cultures, and examining the contributions of visual artists to these transformations, we will explore pressing human questions such as love and desire, infertility and procreation, trust and betrayal, hunger and abundance, parental guidance and child abuse, and the discriminatory practices embedded in these texts, and demonstrate the universality and particularity of such stories and their impact on society at large. By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of fairy tale archetypes and plot structures, various scholarly perspectives on these tales, an awareness of intertextuality, and the ability to analyze stories with multiple layers of meaning. You will also be able to reassess how you and those around you tell stories.",

By centering methodology, students will learn to prepare, collect, analyze, and share oral histories in a variety of written, digital, and artistic forms. Topics of discussion include how to build relationships, conduct interviews around difficult topics, and use citational practices that honor nonhuman and other-than-human actors. Required readings pair classic and new oral histories with texts on the theory, practice, and ethics of storytelling. By centering works by Black, Indigenous, gender minorities, and writers of color, the course examines how storytelling is used to establish and redistribute power.

In November 1969, a group of Indigenous activists occupied Alcatraz Island, claiming that a 1851 treaty required retired federal lands to be returned to Indigenous peoples. Since early colonization and to the present, Americans have practiced \u2018squatting\u2019 to claim lands and spaces as their own, even without legal title.\u00a0These are very different events, but they share a common theme. Each prompt us to consider the central importance of spatial belonging and situatedness to political life. What did the land mean to these people?

Toward that end, the class will be organized around 5 modules, foregrounding present-day and historical movements, following by theoretical reflections.

This course explores the range of answers to such questions by surveying the rise and fall of several major Bronze and Iron Age empires of ancient southwest Asia, including New Kingdom Egypt, the Hittites, Assyria, Babylon, Achaemenid Persia, and the arrival of Hellenism under Alexander of Macedon. In concert with investigating the structure, ideologies, and characteristics of expansion of these imperial powers, the archaeological, visual, and epigraphic record will be engaged to give equal focus to the diverse experiences of peoples subjected to such structures of domination. Specific focus is placed on the region of the ancient Levant and the communities therein, exploring their reaction to these imperial programs throughout the late second through first millennium BCE. In doing so, we will investigate how the intersection of imperial objectives dovetailed with local strategies of resistance and/or adaptation, resulting in the making of ancient Near Eastern societies.",

Strong emotions (both our own, and other people\u2019s) are often involved in both the best and the worst times of our lives. In this seminar we will ask questions like the following: Where do emotions come from? How do they arise, and to what extent is it possible for us to exercise agency over the existence and expression of our emotions? Are emotion categories like anger universal, or culturally relative? Is there something that all instances of anger (for example) have in common, or does \u201canger\u201d encompass a diverse range of states and experiences? Is there a single basis for anger in the brain? Is it possible that we can create an emotion in ourselves by ascribing that emotion to ourselves?For help answering these and other related questions, we will turn to three sources, considered in rotation, to help us construct a dialogue between these authors as they develop their ideas. Brene Brown, in \u201cAtlas of the Heart,\u201d surveys the incredible complexity of human emotion and offers advice on managing these emotions. Lisa Feldman Barrett, in \u201cHow Emotions Are Made,\u201d describes surprising results from neuroscience that contradict folk common sense about the nature of emotions and how they come about.

This course reviews the foundations of causal inference in (bio)statistics, outlining causal-analytic methods that help to extract as much evidence as imperfect observational studies carry about causal effects commonly of interest in applied health science settings. This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis. This course may also introduce elements of semi-parametric theory necessary for the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effect estimands. Where possible, the role of modern regression (i.e., machine learning) techniques and tools for the practical estimation of causal effect estimands will be emphasized.",

If you have any interest in art or politics you should totally take this seminar.",

We will then survey how race and racism historically shaped American political behavior, touching on the American Civil War, the Age of Mass Migration, the Depression and the World Wars. Finally, we will thoroughly investigate the role of race in post-World War II American politics, touching on the Cold War, the Black Rights movement, the post-1965 immigration wave, the conservative backlash to Black Rights, Clinton\u2019s triangulation, the rise of Barack Obama, the rise of Donald Trump, and thinking through the future (and sustainability) of the United States\u2019 increasingly ethno-racially diverse democracy.

India is famously known as the world's largest democracy \u2014 even as some worry about contemporary democratic backsliding \u2014 while Pakistan has alternated between military and civilian governments since its inception. Religion and ethnic diversity have profoundly shaped the political and social landscapes of both nations. Through the lens of nearly eight decades of post-colonial politics, this course introduces students to various social scientific theories concerned with the interplay of democracy, diversity, and development.

As a taxpayer, voter, or parent, you will be connected with formal schooling. You will almost certainly be in the role of teacher at various points in your life, whether in a classroom, in another professional setting, or guiding someone in something you love to do. Leaders in any field are teachers and coaches--they develop the people around them to bring their full potential to some shared ambition. You will also be in the role of learner throughout your life in a variety of forms and contexts. Precisely because we are all learners and teachers and we\u2019ve all had some direct experience with K-12 schools, everyone has interests and opinions about schools. Yet, U.S. K-12 schools are consistently failing to serve all children well. This course will prepare you to recognize the assumptions, binaries, and controversies that drive much of the sound and substance of U.S. K-12 education, and replace those with a different ABCs: awareness, both-and thinking, and context. Learning can get lost in all the noise of education. What would it look like to make schools less about achievement and attainment and more about learning--and what can be your contribution, no matter your future pathways?",

Readings on the syllabus may look daunting, but Liz's weekly prep guides trimmed the material to a very manageable length. It will certainly challenges your preconceptions about schooling, and as long as you are willing to come in with an open mind, you can take a lot away while engaging in friendly debate. The teaching team and assignments were certainly the highlight of this course for me. The TFs were incredibly passionate about their work and receptive to student feedback, which made my time in the course so much more enjoyable. Pennie in particular was absolutely phenomenal, and someone who made learning an absolute blast. Her emphasis on each student's well\u2013being was truly unmatched. I also don't think this course could have picked a better array of assignments\u2013\u2013a reflective essay on our K\u201312 journeys, a teacher interview, and a final project on a topic of choice\u2013\u2013which gave me a lot of agency. The class is quite large at around 100 students, and while that leaves a lot of room to learn from your peers, it also makes for whole\u2013group discussions that sometimes feel unproductive. Note that this is a nearly three\u2013hour course, but it meets once a week, and\u2013\u2013for better or worse\u2013\u2013the time is not made up entirely of lectures. Depending on your attitude towards \"get up and move around\" style activities, you may find yourself enjoying the class sessions to varying degrees.

What are/were the epistemological and material vectors that constitute each word, and how do these vectors bridge the two terms, or conversely, bring them into them conflict? What specific modes of mapping the world have arisen from this combination?\u00a0This undergraduate seminar sketches a trajectory of cinema as an art of formulating subjectivity in Korea, from the colonial period to the present. Bringing together multiple understandings of \u201ctechnology\u201d\u2014in relation to mass media, natural science and engineering, and the operation of governmentality\u2014we will probe how cinema has been a major site of technologies, a central node at which the fostering of pliant subjects for imperialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism, and heteronormative male-centered society in general; the navigation and critique of these very power relations; and encounters with new science and mass media technologies all intersected in Korea.\u00a0Instead of defining Korean cinema as the homogenous realization of some unchanging cultural essence of Korea, this seminar approaches it as a conjunction of diverse modes of addressing the subject\u2019s place within the changing techno-geopolitical, infrastructural, and ecological landscapes surrounding Korea. In tandem with an in-depth reading of each film\u2019s aesthetic and narrative features, we will examine the rationales behind the categorization of films as Joseon film, women\u2019s film, experimental film, Minjok film, Korean New Wave, and Korean blockbusters, to name a few, as proposed by film directors, critics, scholars, film societies, and government institutions.\u00a0The focus of the seminar is placed on these cinematic genres\u2019 (1) approach to the medium of film, audience, and screening venue, (2) their resonance with social movements and theorizations of cinema abroad, (3) the convergence of film aesthetics and infrastructural changes (train, car, factory, etc.) and new media technologies (computer animation, VR, drone, GoPro, etc.), and (4) their frustration or consolidation of the national, ideological, gendered, and epochal boundaries propping up the notion of \u201cKorean.\u201d Building on these concerns, students are encouraged to explore the interplay of multiple technologies through which diverse forms of subjectivity are contested, questioned, and appropriated, and to respond to the central questions posed by the seminar in their final projects.",

This junior tutorial explores the most recent philosophical and policy challenges raised by this emerging technology, with the aim of enabling students to develop an original research project on an unanswered question concerning the impact of AI on human society. These questions may include: under what conditions do chatbots deserve legal personhood or protections? How should we regulate frontier models, and what are the guiding assumptions behind the AI safety movement? Do rich countries have a duty of justice to provide global access to advanced computer chips and open-source LLM code? Can big data improve democratic functioning, and if so, at what cost? And what should we do in the face of the \u201csingularity\u201d?

The Mongol Empire has variously been credited with the inaugural establishment of a globalized world with unprecedented religious toleration and socio-economic exchange. Yet, the Mongols have also been maligned for the mass slaughter of their conquests, brutal deportation policies as well as destruction of Islamic and Chinese urban societies. Between the twin poles of efflorescence and catastrophe lies a rich geography to explore. Who was this steppe people that came to rule the largest contiguous empire in history? What underwrote their rise? How did they order such a vast realm? How much was the Mongol period a watershed for globalization? What legacy did they leave behind for successor states, cultures and the globe?\u00a0We begin by looking closely at the nature of the agglomeration of peoples that eventually became known as the Mongols and how state formation in the steppe created the momentum for conquest. Next, we explore how steppe military culture combined with new technologies and operational strategies that empowered the Mongol military machine. We then turn to questions of localized rule and gender in Mongol-dominated societies. Our third approach is to look at commercial and material cultural exchange through the lens of globalization and localization: we assess the changing vectors for exchange as well as how cultural items themselves moved and transformed. This sections peaks with a discussion of how historiography under the Mongols can serve as a proxy for multi-valent elite perspectives of global empire that were simultaneously localized to their sites of production. Last, we look at how Mongol political culture and imperial practice conditioned that of successor states.",

Such songs, known to classicists as \"epinician poems\" or \"victory odes,\" were usually performed in the victorious athlete\u2019s native city. The poet Pindar, whose career coincides with the first half of the fifth century BCE, was a \u201cstar\u201d composer of such victory odes, and it was a matter of stratospheric prestige for the family of a victorious athlete to succeed in commissioning Pindar to compose for their native son such a celebratory song. The odes to be read in the original Greek for this course will include selections that all students will be reading, balanced with further selections chosen by each student. The amount of reading will be variable, adjusted to each student\u2019s degree of preparation. For example, those who have already studied Homeric poetry will be able to read more, but those students without such background can catch up rapidly, with the professor\u2019s one-on-one help. To be studied in the course is not only the poetic language of Pindar but also the historical background of athletic festivals and of elitist as well as non-elitist ideologies linking the heroic past as a model for athletes\u2014including women athletes.A book that will be consulted in analyzing the historical background of female as well as male athleticism is the professor\u2019s recent book Ancient Greek Heroes, Athletes, Poetry (2024). Pindar\u2019s poetry, especially with reference to the hero Herakles, figures most prominently in that book.

Centering questions of home, nation, and identity, we examine works by U.S.-based and U.S.-born writers in the context of key historical events that have shaped diasporic life in the U.S in the years following World War II, including Japanese internment, the Civil Rights Movement, U.S. interventions in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, the War on Terror, and the so-called illegal migrant crisis at the Mexico-U.S. border. Alongside an array of historical sources, including political speeches, activist publications, executive orders and government documents, primary course materials may include literary texts by James Baldwin, Ocean Vuong, Jamaica Kincaid, and Valeria Luiselli; performance art by Xandra Ibarra; and landmark scholarship by Saidiya Hartman, Mimi Nguyen, Stuart Hall, and Edward Said.",

Yet, while some individuals will recover naturally, others will experience lasting effects on how they think, feel, and behave. Together we will explore the many ways humans adapt to adversity and consider reconceptualizing disorders that arise from traumatic and stressful events (e.g., trauma- and stressor-related disorders, personality disorders, anxiety, depression, substance use, and more). The course will also provide an expansive view of how people adapt to adversity, including natural recovery and post-traumatic growth. We will take a deep dive into understanding diagnostic criteria of trauma-related disorders (and the application of criteria across cultural groups) and explore why some people are more vulnerable to developing traumatic stress. We will also consider factors impacting recovery, evidence-based treatments for trauma-related disorders, and related controversies in the field.",

      "Overall I think this is a very nice course! I will note I came in with what I would call substantial mathematical maturity (I took math25). I think the course would be harder to approach for someone that's just learning proof structures like induction, contraposition, contradiction. For the rising sophomores looking to take the class, I would suggest going over some of these basic proof techniques that you might have learned in your cs20/similar background. Having some grasp of these ideas will help you tremendously.I don't think the proofs in the course require a great deal of cleverness or insight, especially not on exams. I would study the course content and I think if you know the course content you will be fine. The exams I believe were fair and of moderate difficulty level. As long as you study and prepare I think you will be fine. I would suggest doing the psets on your own at first and really thinking through the problems, but having a good pset group can be really helpful too. And I met some really cool people through cs120 that I really bonded with! I think the course overall does a great job of attempting to build community, though I sort of stumbled on my new friends by happenstance. Either way, I'm grateful to have found cool people to pset with and to have made new friends. Be open to meeting some cool new people through cs120! It'll make your life in the course a lot more fun. Don't be a stereotypical antisocial CS kid \u2013 even if you can do the psets on your own without any help, I suggest interacting with other people. Talking through and explaining ideas in the class are good ways to build in some early prep that pays off at exam time.The SREs are really not that painful, and some of them are quite enjoyable. Just set your alarm and make sure you get on that SEC shuttle. Having the one drop is pretty nice and gives a little bit of leeway.I think Salil is a really good lecturer. He explains things clearly and is really likable and personable. And he's even active on Ed sometimes! (Which tends to be a rarity among really senior professors. I appreciate him being down to earth like that.)I think Anurag is an amazing person and professor too, though I think by virtue of being so prolific in CS as a researcher he might have forgotten what it's like to learn these concepts for the first time and I wish he might emphasize different aspects of the content when lecturing. He had a tendency to linger for quite some time on really simple stuff that students get quickly and gloss over concepts that he seemed to regard as trivial but were actually quite subtle details worth spending some time on.One of our head TFs in the course Maxwell was truly phenomenal! I really appreciated his review sessions for the midterm and final, and I think they were very much worth going to, at least until they diverged into kind of trivial questions by students that were just really confused (this is not at all the fault of Maxwell). I do hope that future iterations of the course will be lucky enough to have a TF willing to take on conducting quality review sessions. If this is the case, I absolutely recommend making use of that resource.Honestly I don't think I ever went to section. It's there if you want it, and I heard from friends that a lot of them were really excellent. Section just isn't how I prefer to learn. Reading the lecture notes is great review though, as they are really high quality. Office hours were good, though oftentimes very crowded. Sometimes the TFs seemed to not quite grasp the pset entirely or lead students astray, but generally I think they were as good as can reasonably be expected and I really appreciate all their effort. Honestly I don't think the course is so terribly difficult that you need to be at office hours trying to farm everything, and you really do yourself a disservice come exam time if you don't try to independently think through the problems. Think for yourself (you learn more that way), and get yourself a nice group of friends (see above) in the class. Again, meet new people!Grading wise: I don't think it was that hard to earn R+'s on the psets, but you do need to be mathematically rigorous to an extent (see above again). For the participation, really just write in depth responses and you can score some R+'s. Honestly I am a little concerned about how they will draw final grades especially between A and A\u2013 grades. I would be careful and try to do your best especially on the exams. I think most students, especially with all the revisions allowed, get really high pset scores, so the exams seem to be the primary way they differentiate amongst students which is a bit stressful. I do wish they were more transparent about the +/\u2013 modifiers and what exam performance correlates and more detail about the grade distribution.Overall though a great course. I think you get a lot about elegance in computer science theory and learn to appreciate the more theoretical side of algorithms. Some of the content can be really beautiful. Honestly all things considered I am glad I took the class. Thanks to the professors and TFs for a great semester!",
      "Read the lecture notes thoroughly. Lectures themselves are helpful for digesting a higher level understanding of the concepts but you will only really master the material if you know the lecture notes inside out. Also, you should attempt problem sets alone as this will force you to really understand the material. Finally, there is initially a bit of an adjustment to the rigor demanded by the problem sets. Whilst there is a bit of a struggle earlier on in the semester, with practice you get a lot faster and better at formalizing explanations and so if you stick at it  by the end of the semester you will be able to type up proofs with ease.",

How different are we from foreigners? Or what\u00a0happens to the victims of war?\u00a02500 years later, ancient Greek tragedy is all\u00a0around us, from Broadway to hip hop to\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0to TV advertisements.\u00a0Its adaptations can expose\u00a0forms of inequity: Luis Alfaro\u2019s play\u00a0Oedipus el\u00a0Rey, for example, highlights incarceration rates among Latinx communities\u00a0in 21st-century America. They can examine recent historical events\u00a0that have fundamentally affected our understandings of race, conflict, and immigration,\u00a0from Apartheid and the\u00a0Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Ya\u00ebl\u00a0Farber\u2019s\u00a0Molora) to the ongoing civil\u00a0war in Syria (Queens of Syria). They can also provide models for\u00a0explorations of identity\u2014as we can see when Freddie Mercury becomes Dionysus in\u00a0Queen\u2019s iconic video for \u201cI Want to Break Free.\u201d In\u00a0this course you will read,\u00a0watch, and listen to some of the most recent reincarnations of ancient Greek\u00a0tragedies alongside the original plays. You will think about how such an old\u00a0artform can change how we respond to 21st-century problems, and how\u00a0it can make us think differently about ourselves.",

And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course will explore the means by which Black poets have innovated upon the lyric tradition to accommodate a sense of allegiance to a collective. In this tradition, the lyric poem has become a powerful tool with which to ponder the dynamics of self and other, intimate and political\u2014and justice and injustice. Course readings will include work by seminal 20th\u00a0Century American\u00a0figures such as Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Hayden and Lucille Clifton, as well as contemporary voices like Jericho Brown, Tyehimba Jess, Morgan Parker, Eve L.

    "qrating": 3.43,
    "course_description": "Can we have confidence that our moral claims are true?For centuries in the West, Jewish and Christian thinkers (among others) have asserted that moral judgment is impossible without some concept of the deity. So convincing were they that one important character created by a Russian author of the nineteenth century was led to express the idea (if not exactly the words), \"if there is no God, all is permitted.\"\u00a0In more recent times some thinkers have challenged this assumption, and insisted that removing (or reducing) the role of God is indispensable to proper moral discourse. This course will examine the ways in which a concept of God has informed Western moral discourse, trying to help students engage the literature as they confront the basic question, why might one think \"if there is no God, all is permitted?\" and why might one think if there is a God human moral achievement is diminished or impossible. Further, we will examine ways in which the differing paradigms actually affect the moral conclusions we might generate.Belief in God and denial of God's existence have each figured prominently in Western moral discourse. Arguments have been advanced that: autonomous human reasoning is incapable of arriving at moral truths without a supreme principle to ground the system (which is sometimes invested with \"personality\" and called God); that autonomous human reasoning can have no impact on moral behavior due to human failure that only God can \"correct\"; that autonomous moral reasoning is impossible, and morality can only be understood as the submission to the will of a superior moral being; that a concept of God is necessary to direct and regulate moral reasoning, but the actual confessional versions of theism are metaphysically implausible or impossible; that autonomous human moral reasoning is impossible with God, and thus only a-theism can lead to moral conclusions. This course will engage all these different themes.",

      "I have such mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, the course staff is incredible. Professor Harris is thoughtful, in\u2013touch with student experiences, and entertaining in lecture. My TF was also very on\u2013top of things, responsive, and helpful in section. The material is absolutely fascinating. You cover readings from literally centuries ago up to the present, yet everything you read feels relevant and personal. The discussions in section with students were eye\u2013opening and inspiring.At the same time, although this was my first GenEd, I still don't think it is anything like other GenEd classes. This class has only been a GenEd for a few years, so I think the difficulty is a remnant of when it was a small, department class, not a GenEd with over a hundred students. The course design was very thoroughly thought\u2013out, which I appreciated, yet I found the design incredibly frustrating. If you want to fully participate in the course, it requires hours of reading (often ~100 pages per class) and at least half an hour of video lectures before ever stepping into the classroom. The in\u2013person lectures were primarily answering student questions. I personally struggled with the flipped\u2013classroom style\u2013\u2013I'm way more likely to learn something when I'm sitting in a class than when I'm trying to watch a video in my free time. Many students hardly ever showed up to the in\u2013person lectures. Additionally, the essays (which are the main assignments in the course) were anonymously graded\u2013\u2013fair in theory, but it meant I got minimal feedback and wasn't able to talk to the person who had actually read my essay.A few things I wish I could tell my past self: \u2013   Take the class pass\u2013fail. You will be able to enjoy the content without stressing over B's on the essays. I understand that a B is a respectable grade, but I gave real effort on my writing and just didn't have the bandwidth to spend more time on this course. I gave these essays more energy than I ever did for an expos essay, for example, and still got worse grades than I have in any other course. I'm frustrated that this GenEd will likely bring down my GPA. I know that's not what's important here, but I still care about it and I'm guessing you do too. \u2013   This course is better if you have prior philosophy experience. There is very little guidance or support if you are new to reading philosophy\u2013\u2013and believe me, it is hard to do for the first time. Similarly, there is very little support for actually crafting an argument for your essays (the course staff basically refused to give examples of what a thesis might sound like or how a student might construct a philosophical argument). My TF and Professor Harris were happy to give feedback on my drafts (and very kind to do so), but I felt alone in figuring out where to begin. The essays also require you to think in a way that isn't really addressed in the course itself. The lectures, videos, and sections are focused on understanding the views of one philosopher at a time, and almost no time is spend discussing critiques or shortcomings of a philosopher. Then, the essays ask you to find flaws and compare different philosophers, which I found very challenging and new.  \u2013   Be honest with yourself about the impact of this material on you personally. I think a lot of students are interested in this course because they are themselves religious or because they have left religion and want to think deeply about it. I know this sounds kind of silly, but I came into this course hoping it would be valuable during a very unstable spiritual period of my life, and it put me through the wringer emotionally. I left more existential than I came in, and although I thought I wanted that, it was so overwhelming and debilitating at times. I don't think this course would help someone figure out what they do or don't believe. On the last day of class, Professor Harris' send\u2013off was simply \"I hope you leave feeling confused.\" So. Take that as you will.I know I've been pretty harsh here, and I'm sorry for the essay. I think this course has so much potential, and for many of the philosophy\u2013minded students, I'm sure it was a very positive experience. Professor Harris has so much wisdom to share, it's a great way to read a lot of philosophy if you've been looking for an excuse, and you'll meet a lot of awesome students with really interesting perspectives on religion and morally. You'll have fascinating discussions in sections and learn a lot of different, valid ways of approaching similar moral challenges. That said, I cried SO MUCH over this course and I'm not sure the perspective I gained was worth having my GenEd be the most energetically\u2013demanding class in my semester.",

Did the Prophet Muhammad preach monotheism to a group of crude idolaters, or were his opponents already monotheists (if imperfect ones) who were also familiar with biblical ideas about God and history? Was Mecca an important center of Arabian pilgrimage and commerce before Islam, or was it a small town of local significance that grew in influence only after Islam? Did the followers of the Prophet and the residents of Arabia imagine themselves as sharing a common ethnic identity as \u201cArabs,\u201d or did they subscribe to a multiplicity of local tribal or geographical identities and developed a shared sense of being \u201cArab\u201d after they conquered the Near East? Did the early Muslims believe in the imminent end of the world or not? Was Islam originally an ecumenical monotheistic movement open to Jews and Christians, or did Islam\u2019s earliest adherents consider it a new and exclusive religion separate from Judaism and Christianity? Is the Qur\u2019anic text a record of Muhammad\u2019s own preaching or the result of a collective effort that continued after him (and perhaps had begun before him)? This course is dedicated to an in-depth discussion of such fundamental historiographic questions. In the process, we will delve into some of the earliest literary and documentary witnesses to Islam\u2019s beginnings and read from foundational works of scholarship on Islam\u2019s origins.

      "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Prepare to have your mind\u2013blown every second!!! I left every single lecture with a new appreciation for how amazing biology is and raved to my friends about what I was learning. I cannot recommend this course enough!!!Even things that seemed dull like HPG axis became super interesting. Professor McKinley has amazing slides and is super engaging, so you will come away with a great understanding of the material. We talked about how disease manifests in patients, scientific studies that were fundamental to our understanding of the biological process, as well as bit of epidemiology and ethics/history. I think about the HPG every day when I take my birth control. I wish someone had explained it earlier, but better late than never I guess. Come to class every day, pay attention, ask questions, it is worth waking up for :)PSETs really are doable on your own but start early. For the trickier questions, it\u2019s good to sleep on it. There are a not a lot of assignments so put your best foot forward on these. Professor McKinley has a zero\u2013bullshit attitude that I really appreciated. It meant the course was rigorous (in terms of meaningful scientific thinking) without being too difficult.Start thinking of ideas for the final project early!!!!! You will have to iterate a lot and it will be discouraging but once you find something that works you will write an incredible proposal and give a fire presentation and truly will feel so much pride for how far you have come. The course staff is super encouraging throughout so you will overcome initial bumps in the road\u2026I wish I had put more effort into preparing for fishbowl. Basically you get a list of words and you should know a definition for it to play \u201ctaboo\u201d in class. It was easy to \u201cget by\u201d if you knew associated things without really knowing the meaning of the word itself, but it meant some words never really got learned. You get out what you put in.The guest speakers are AMAZING!!!! I learned about so much amazing cutting\u2013edge research (shout out to Smita Gopinath and her lecture about the vaginal microbiome!!! Literally rocked my world). Professor McKinley is super well\u2013connected in the reproductive biology world and brings world\u2013class scientists, ethicists and physicians to speak with the class. Her own research had it\u2019s own lecture dedicated to it, and literally my JAW DROPPED. It is so cool and will change lives one day.The TFs are super supportive and knowledgeable. If you come in with less of a biology background (eg, not a SCRB concentrator) they are really open to helping you catch up. Be sure to pay attention to the first couple lectures about scientific methods and genetics since those are important to the PSET, do the practice PSETs and come to office hours to check your work on it to address areas of misunderstanding. An early investment here will pay off the rest of the course.I literally would enroll in this class again if I could. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE EVERY SECOND. Makes me feel lucky to get to go to Harvard and learn from such amazing faculty <3",

In addition to novels, we\u2019ll look at op-eds, essays, poems, plays, photography, performance art, and film with an eye to thinking about how different genres speak to the larger world of politics, activism, citizenship, rights, and popular culture. Learning how to decode metaphors and images in novels, films, and other works will make you a more sophisticated reader of the texts that circulate outside the classroom. As you sharpen your ability to critically analyze these works as products of particular political and historical moments, you will become a more nuanced reader of the world around you, able to think critically about other texts (not only literature, but memes, videos, blogs, games, tweets, and advertising) that circulate in our own cultural moment and their crucial relationship to identity and social change.",

Building on the foundations of Marxian philosophy and the works of 20th-century critical theorists such as Luk\u00e1\u00e7s, Benjamin, Heidegger, Marcuse, and Foucault, we will explore more recent contributions in the philosophy and post-phenomenology of technology as well as social constructivism and feminist theory.\u00a0While largely designed as a theory course, this tutorial takes a closer look at artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, surveillance capitalism, data feminism, and digital culture to investigate how these new technologies shape our social reality. The tutorial ends with a module on Afrofuturism as a potentially emancipatory form of techno-utopianism.\u00a0\u00a0Questions we will address along the way include: how do science and technology transform and mediate human experience and knowledge of the world? radically affect our political and social order? shape concepts of human subjectivity and regulate human behavior? And what kinds of political, ethical, and aesthetic consequences do we need to consider as we adopt new technology? Rather than conceptualizing science and technology in Promethean terms as \u201ctools\u201d of progress, we will closely examine how they are intrinsically constitutive of the ways we experience ourselves and the world around us. The aim is to collaboratively articulate, over the course of the semester, an amplified social theoretic framework that enables us to critically engage with the existential challenges and potential dangers of new technology and normatively evaluate scientific and technological innovations from the standpoint of human flourishing.",

More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today's newer languages, via which you'll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike.

Exploring creativity takes us into the very question of what makes us human, and the answers we discover can help equip us for the lives we will lead beyond the classroom. This course casts a wide net, crossing disciplines as it takes us from ancient treatises on the art of poetic composition to modern brain scans, and from centuries-old debates over intellectual property to present-day questions of artificial intelligence.

It will scrutinize the phenomena of movement, mobility, and migration across the ancient Mediterranean world through textual, visual, and material evidence.

Religion will feature prominently, as we study sanctuaries, ceremonies, and rituals that inspired movement or mobility at either the local, regional, or imperial level. More social questions related to migration will examine the historical evidence for large-scale demographic displacement and its causes, but we will also incorporate relevant data produced by recent advances in archaeological science. By focusing on movement and migration in the ancient Mediterranean, this course provides an interdisciplinary, multi-methodological introduction to a significant aspect of human societies, both ancient and modern.The seminar will invite graduate students to reflect on the pedagogical challenge of constructing a course geared towards undergraduates on the theme of the class (by focusing on hands-on exercises about instructional choices, syllabus construction, assignment selection, and so on).",

    "course_description": "This experimental, practice-based course presents an opportunity for students engaged in audiovisual work, whether in the (overlapping) contexts of media anthropology, critical media practice, film, or art, to focus primarily on the sonic aspects of their experiments in nonfiction, and to gain experience in working with audio in conjunction with other media. Modes of practice will include audio recording, sound design, editing, and postproduction. We will begin by examining the rubric of \u201cmultimodality\u201d in the context of anthropology, and its ethical implications and possibilities for approaches to sensory ethnography. Projects will ideally be ones already underway by each student, and will also include opportunities for collaboration with fellow students. Through readings and listening sessions (or \u201cscreenings\u201d) we will also listen beyond the academy to experiments in other domains, including sound art, ethnographic film, and other nonfiction media practices. The course seeks to problematize, perhaps even undermine, and reformulate ideas and practices which combine audio with moving image or other media. Aesthetics and ethics, theory and technique, concept and practice are interwoven at every level in multimodal work, and so this course will combine technical workshops with working through conceptual and theoretical motivations and implications of the work throughout the semester. Rather than taking up conventions or formulae, the course will provide a space for experimentation, to reconsider possibilities in an expanded sense of nonfiction for relationships between audio and image, text, or other media.",

    "course_description": "ESE/EPS 166 engages the new Harvard Climate Observatory that will fundamentally herald a new era in both climate research and the development of strategic approaches to advancing the climate impact on public policy. The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy. An important part of the course is the display of Harvard flight instruments in the laboratory and the strategy for addressing unsolved scientific problems with new instrumentation.",

What defines slavery in the modern world, and what are the moral, political and social implications of its continued existence? As we explore its underpinnings, we discover that all of us may be in some way complicit in its survival. This course surveys the nature, types and extent of modern servitude such as transnational and domestic prostitution, forced marriage, labor trafficking and forced domestic labor, child soldiering and other forms of enslavement of children, organ trafficking and other health aspects of trafficking, debt-bondage, and the forced exploitation of other vulnerable groups such as refugees and stateless persons. Throughout the course, but especially in the final part, we examine anti-trafficking and anti-slavery measures and movements and ways in which you can increase awareness or become involved. You will, by the end of our exploration, be able to trace the moral and ethical arguments surrounding human slavery in its various forms, understand the ways in which this problem still affects so many people, and what can and should be done about it.",

      "This course was helpful for advancing my thesis and for that reason and that reason alone, I would take it again. This course forced me to regularly think about my thesis and also helped me understand how to apply for grant funding and obtain IRB approval. That said, this course was one of the worst I have taken at Harvard. The assignments were poorly organized, essentially busywork, and graded on such a massive delay as to be essentially unhelpful in their feedback most of the time. For example, the reading response assignments were about application readings that were almost all about eastern europe (not even close to my area of gov) so it felt difficult and unhelpful for me to write all of the critiques about these papers. The first paper I wrote during one of the first weeks of the class still hadn't been graded as of reading period, so I wasn't able to implement feedback from it in order to improve later papers. Regarding the project papers, the guidelines were so incredibly vague that the assignments became extremely frustrating. And the fact that they weren't graded cummulatively meant that myself and many of my classmates were constantly instructed to repeat ourselves in these papers and a lot of the feedback I got was asking for information that I had included in previous papers but had not had the word count to repeat in the following papers. It was unclear what the TFs and professors would be looking for in these papers and I was often given conflicting information from TFs and professors as to what they wanted me to prioritize. At some points they even disagreed quite vehemently about the feedback I was eventually given. The actual class time was also pretty unhelpful. It felt like we just repeatedly did the same TF\u2013led activities week after week (building research plans for topics or questions) but at least myself and my table group entered the class at the beginning of the semester already having a strong grasp of how to do this so I don't feel that we gained much from it and we had more and more trouble buying into the activities as the semester went on. It just felt like a weekly waste of time. The most helpful moments of the class were when we would get into discussions that were essentially just Q&A sessions for advice on how to best implement a specific method, but these discussions were often cut off by the professor in order to \"get us back on track\" to the activities the TFs had planned that were not particularly helpful. In general, the whole class just felt very disorganized and like it had too many useless assignments. I'm not sure exactly what the solution is, but the class needs to be restructured somehow. Perhaps moving the lecture back to be during the actual class period would be a start, as it did not seem like \"flipping\" the class was worth it for the activities we did during the class period. It would have been much nicer to have the chance to ask advice style questions about each method and the ability to ask questions during the lecture.",

      "I cannot recommend this class enough! I came into this semester pretty uncertain about whether I wanted to take this class because I was worried it would be too hard (I had just finished 140a). The class was certainly a challenge \u2014 I had to block of quite a bit of time over the weekend to do the weekly readings and at times it felt like I was reading at a snails pace \u2014 but overall it was extremely doable. The teaching staff provides so much support to make it possible. There are vocab lists every week with key vocabulary that helps a lot for the readings. Because the texts are a bit challenging your Chinese improves quite noticeably over the course of the class which is great. You also have a one on one meeting with the TFs every week to answer questions, discuss the texts, and get feedback on your paper. The paper is super scaffolded because you only have to turn in a short chunk of it every other week. I will flag that you have to come up with your paper topic extremely early in the semesters, though, so I would start thinking about that right away. The one caveat I will say for this class is that there are *a lot* of assignments and deadlines. But the grading is extremely generous and there's extra credit, so while you have a fair bit to do every week grades are not a concern.Ultimately, it was extremely rewarding to feel that years of studying Chinese has paid off to the point where instead of learning to read in Chinese I am now reading to learn. The stories are so delightful and Professor Wang\u2019s lectures are absolutely phenomenal, providing historical context and analysis of the texts. I learned so much about Chinese history and culture through this class. Please take this class!!!",

      "OMG I LOVED THIS CLASS. Quantum mechanics is such a cool topic and I'm so glad I decided to skip 15c and take it. I was worried because Cora tells everyone in the beginning \"I'm gonna assume you all took 15b and 15c\" but to be honest, you're totally fine without 15c. Besides, quantum teaches you all the stuff that's actually relevant moving on from 15c without you having to go through the 15c growing pains. It's awesome because taking 143a will open a lot of gates for you: you have more options for physics courses or research labs to join. It's a great pill to swallow. I personally am not a fan of the psets. They felt very computational to the point that I was questioning if I'm taking QM or Math 1a. It's literally pages and pages of stupid Gaussian integrals where you have to integrate by parts like 3 times for one integral. And there's like at least 12 integrals to evaluate on most of the early psets. I think I would've done better if the psets were conceptually challenging and tested my understanding of the material instead of my ability to compute integrals. But that's more of a problem with the book that the problems are sourced from, I suppose. Speaking of the book, Griffith's book is great (a pretty standard textbook) and it was pretty clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend reading the book because it's very easy to follow along the derivations, get lost in the math, and forget about what you're doing at a conceptual level. In terms of pre\u2013reqs, DEFINITELY TAKE LINEAR ALGEBRA BEFORE. You absolutely MUST understand how to diagonalize matrices, the concept behind eigenvalues, vector spaces, etc. Knowing Fourier Analysis helps too. I found my knowledge from 21b transferred beautifully. Thinking of constructing eigenbases, understanding the spectral theorem, etc can help you establish a stronger understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Of course if you want an even more rigorous introduction to QM you could take 251. But the point of this course is to provide you the basic tools to start doing real physics. There are likely freshman who want to skip 15b, 15c and take this course. I think you could totally do that as long as you have taken 21b/22a. If you've taken Physics 19, you'll find that some things are familiar. If you have zero experience with linear algebra, definitely do not take it. It's impossible to take this course without linear algebra\u2013\u2013 you would either have to crash course it or you would be memorizing formulas without really understanding.I loved this course so much and it has definitely made me hungry to learn more physics!!",
      "READ THE TEXTBOOK! And if its been a while since you've taken Linear Algebra, then refer to the textbook's appendix, which makes for a very helpful refresher on the necessary concepts. I simply did not find the lectures sufficient to learn the material, and, in all honesty, I learned most of the material from reading.For the engineers out there thinking that it would be cool and quirky to study quantum mechanics, be very wary of the work that it takes. It is just as difficult as its reputation purports and in the end, you will end up with very niche knowledge about a topic that will have almost no practical application. That said, if quantum subfields of electronics or particle accelerators are your thing, then go for it, but as a mechanical engineer, I unfortunately never see myself using this information except for the intuition it gave me for real\u2013world applications of linear algebra.",

    "course_description": "This laboratory movement course teaches performers how to animate puppets and objects. Students develop a movement skillset different from that of the actor or dancer, specific to the puppeteer. While training students\u2019 bodies, the course expands their minds\u2019 ability to recognize the potential for liveness in all things and generate story without words. We work with simple objects, solo tabletop puppets, giant ensemble puppets, and bunraku-style dolls.Similar in format to a dance class, students begin each day with movement exercises training specific puppeteer skills: manipulating energy inside and outside the body; harnessing momentum and suspension; moving body appendages separately from one another; and performing \u2018invisibly.\u2019 Exercises lead into improvisations. Students learn to devise original dramatic material with patterns and movement dynamics in every class.\u00a0We begin with non-anthropomorphic, simple objects like spheres and sticks, followed by materials that can spontaneously transform into creatures, like newspaper. At midterm, students each devise a solo scene with a tabletop puppet, figurative or otherwise. The foundation movement skills provide a common vocabulary for giving and receiving feedback. This trains students\u2019 eyes for analysis and offers a path forward for revising their performances.The second half of the course focuses on multi-operator puppets where leading and creative following is key. Students learn to perform in a group, attend to all action onstage, and, in improvisation, react with the best choice for the whole. With bunraku-style puppets, we study how to convey a sense of gravity, the mechanics of puppet walking and running, puppeteer choreography, and what makes a puppet appear to think and feel.\u00a0Movement work is supplemented with short readings that engender a conversation on the nature of puppets. What is or isn\u2019t a puppet and why? Who is the puppeteer within a scene? How can this unique relationship dynamically change to support the storytelling? How does the inanimate nature of a puppet inspire choreography as well as thematic content? What is a puppet stage and how is it central to story and liveness?The final project is a group scene performed for a live audience during reading week.

Small losses most of us learn to bear with equanimity. But enormous, wrenching, life-changing losses open voids in our lives for which we can never feel adequately prepared, even if we can see them coming. This course tries to understand the nature of loss on a physical and emotional level, to give us some framework for coping with it and to help us develop some empathy in those very difficult situations when someone else has faced a loss and we do not know how to react. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our main focus will be upon the loss of someone \u201cclose\u201d to us, through either death or a personality-changing accident or illness (\u201cclose\u201d is in quotation marks, because some of these losses may be of public figures whom we have never met personally, but whose loss makes an impact on our entire society). We will compare this form of loss with others, such as loss of country through exile or forced migration and loss of part of oneself through amputation. Our approach will be threefold: we will try to understand the physiological and psychological effects of loss; we will study the rituals that different societies have evolved to mark loss and memorialize the lost; and we will analyze literary, musical, artistic, and architectural expressions of loss, chiefly \u201cgreat works,\u201d but also some quite humble attempts to record the emotional rupture that loss entails. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will work on a broad canvas, both spatially and chronologically, looking at testimonies as various as Cicero\u2019s reactions to the death of his adult daughter; interviews with refugees from the war in Syria; and poetry inspired by the Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial. We will read four books: the memoir of a survivor of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004; a novel about a woman\u2019s gradual loss of her mental capacity to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease; and the accounts of two great twentieth-century authors, C. S. Lewis and Joan Didion, each struggling to survive the loss of their spouse. We will encounter tombstones with simple inscriptions commemorating the death of family pets from the Roman world and set these in the context of scientific research on the human-animal bond. We will study prayers for the dead in the major faith traditions, and visit (virtually) the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, to consider the therapeutic effects of the somber walls of its octagonal interior. We will study photographs by Dorothea Lange documenting poverty and hopelessness during the Depression. We will learn how to listen to a Requiem Mass, whether we encounter it in a sacred building or (more likely) a concert hall. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the end of the course, which will have ranged far beyond these few examples, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the effects of loss on us both individually and collectively, and of the rituals and therapies that different societies have developed over time to mark and manage it. And we will have learned how fragile is the nature of what we love, and how much we should cherish it while we have the chance.",

As a foundational element in the structure of U.S. society, slavery has made a lasting imprint on social, cultural, political, economic, and ecological relations. Nevertheless, American public culture has avoided sustained exploration of the broad and complex history of racialized slavery and instead maintains a stance of discomfort, distance, and ambivalence. We will discuss change over time in public representations of slavery while also addressing the tensions of collaboration and audience engagement.",

      "I took this class because I have a lot of respect for this teaching team, having taken a class with Greg and the head TF, Arin, before, and for my secondary.  Take this class if you want the experience of learning from someone who has spent his entire life mastering his craft, is extremely passionate about what he is talking about, and if you want to be exposed to new things in a super chill environment with people who just want to let you explore your interests. However, you will get out of this class what you put into it, so although it might seem tempting to let the chaos of other classes drive, don't short change yourself by ignoring this one. For those who require any kind of accommodations, the head TF, Arin, couldn't be any more on top of things, and will make sure she has you covered. The course has only one assignment throughout the semester, a final project that you can work up to throughout the semester. There are almost no required readings, but a lot of fun recommended ones from Greg. The weekly meetings consist of a lot of Greg sharing his interests, sharing different film clips and operas from all kinds of languages, and working to build in student presentations as the semester continues, and you begin to develop your ideas. He also loves to hold open houses throughout the week, where you can go talk about your final projects, and get wisdom from him and the teaching staff. these are lots of fun, and usually lead you down various side quests that can be super interesting to explore. Greg genuinely just loves to learn, connect with his students, and allow them to explore their own interests, and because of this, if you choose to engage with him and buy into the course, this is a super easy, rewarding, and low time commitment course that you should take.",

Ten great experiments that have transformed our understanding of nature will guide us, first through immersion in the scholarship and popular beliefs of the time. Next, how did the discoverer prepare? What were the motivations, prior experiences, and training that led to the threshold of a fruitful advance? Then, to the degree possible, we will carry out the exact same investigations, building our own simple equipment from scratch, duplicating the challenges of wresting patterns from noisy and incomplete data. Students will compare their results to both private and published versions of the original research. The course will examine the magnitude of the cognitive shifts experienced and the often uphill battle to acceptance. We will build an understanding of the nature of scientific progress, examining how the mastery of natural phenomena leads to new technologies and how these can contribute to further scientific discovery.Experiments are drawn from the natural sciences, ancient to modern, from Eratosthenes measuring the earth\u2019s size to Rosalind Franklin determining the structure of DNA. We will consider how these discoveries continue to impact society, as well as the many ethical questions raised. The course will examine the difficulty of accepting new experimental evidence falsifying accepted scientific paradigms and how this remains an issue that plays out in current society. By unpacking these 10 experiments, students will be able to better prepare for their own future discoveries and contributions.",

But do you even know what a \u201cbook\u201d is? Is it merely a conveyor, a platform, for presenting a text? Can a book have a use other than being read? Does the nature of the material artifact inscribed with words shape or influence the way you understand their meaning? Do people read a scroll differently than they do a book with pages? Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed\u2014from tablets to e-books\u2014and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a \u201cbook,\u201d from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations\u2014and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them. Books we will look at will range from the Bible to Vesalius, from Homer to Harold and His Purple Crayon. Sections will visit the Weissman Preservation Center, Houghton Library, Fine Arts Special Collections, and the Harvard Art Museum, and all students will be required to study a manuscript close-up and participate in a printing workshop. The book as a material object is the focus of the course. The capstone project will be the creation of a (short) book by each student and an accompanying paper explaining its place in the history of the book in the West.After taking this course, you will never look at a book in the same way.",

We will use online platforms to look closely at masterpieces around the world, using Zoom to virtually travel to distant museums and meet with their curators.

Not much (traditional) philosophical work was done.Great introductory class to moral philosophy concerning sex, love, and friendship. In this first iteration of the class, a significant emphasis  was placed on whole\u2013class discussions. This was great in some ways, and not so great in others. The discussions were often interesting, funny, and perspective\u2013bringing. Additionally, students' commentary gave Professor Schouten material to work with and helped guide her lectures. However, the amount of time we spent doing class discussions came at the cost of Prof. Schouten actually lecturing. As such, I left many classes wishing that she had lectured more and communicated more of her thoughts on the philosophers' arguments. This brings me to my greatest criticism of the course. Despite the content being engaging, Professor Schouten being amazing, the class discussions being fun, and the readings being relevant and carefully chosen, this course wasn't exactly a philosophy course. I understand it's an introductory course. Even so, we spent remarkably little time actually doing philosophy. Most lectures, we would spend at most five or ten minutes trying to understand the philosophers' arguments (instead, we spent more time understanding their claims and we thought about their claims). As a result, most of the philosophy work happened while writing the two papers. That being said, it's clear that Prof. Schouten has a different perspective on what counts as philosophy, so we definitely did a lot of philosophical\u2013ish discussion.",

Dr. Noll is phenomenal and truly cares for her students, as you can see from the way she structured the course and its assignments and simply how she interacts with us, and is always supportive of our needs and goals, and even helps us with things beyond academia. I also became great friends with everyone in the class and looked forward every Tuesday and Thursday to seeing them. One caveat \u2013 you will be asked to produce a TON of writing with weekly one\u2013page single spaced reading logs, and around 6ish longer papers as well.

      "Absolute gem for premeds looking to fulfill their physics req that are also trying to keep up/boost their gpa. I took PS2 in the fall and really enjoyed working with the course staff, but was really concerned about my gpa while juggling a thesis. This class was a godsend. Yes, there is a lot of weekly work that you have to keep up with, but I'd take it any day over trying to study for an exam a few days before a thesis deadline (your priorities might be very different if you arent thesising). It's important to note that (in my opinion) the content doesn't prepare you as well for the mcat the way that ps2/ps3 does, but if you're already studying for the exam then you kind of already learn the specific content that you need to know (i know a few people that took the mcat before enrolling in AP50B that just taught themselves that material from practice books). So, if mcat prep is your concern, i wouldn't be too worried.I was confused about the workload for this class going into it, so I'll explain below for anyone also confused or trying to balance out an already difficult courseload.Assignments:This class is almost entirely based on effort rather than correctness (but they know if you completely BS assignments or don't put any time into them, so don't do that). If you just put in 1\u20133 hours for each big weekly assignment (readings/learning catalytics = 1 chapter per week and ~12 multiple choice questions, desmos tutorial = 30 shorter questions, challenge = 3 long multi\u2013step questions), and spread it across several days, then it's super manageable and flexible to work with (cramming is also doable but just more exhausting lol). It's just like psetting but without the crying. I used to spend way too much time on assignments in the beginning of the semester, but once you get used to the flow of it and get a better feeling for student expectations, then it's much easier to work more efficiently. then, during one half of class (2x a week) you're expected to meet with your team and review your responses, discuss them with a TF, and then receive the answer key and submit corrections/a short reflection for each tutorial and challenge. If you're efficient with your time, these corrections can usually be entirely done during class. You also need to re\u2013do your learning catalytics questions as a team after you do it individually, and have to make sure that you get at least 50% correct.Projects:the other half of class is spent on either project prep in the lab or \"skill session\" activities in which you learn skills specific to your project, e.g. arduino coding. your projects and skill sessions can usually be done entirely within the allotted class time, it's great. The projects are pretty relaxed since you have time to work on them during class, as long as everyone in your group pulls their weight, then it's a breeze. I got lucky with great groups (they're randomly assigned) but you can always communicate to the course staff if you're struggling. The final project was much shorter than the 2 semester projects, which meant that the class was done before reading period. Attendance:you have the option to complete your team homework reviews on zoom if some members are sick, but usually always have to be in person for the project/skill session stuff anyways so you basically need to attend every class, but the course staff are pretty understanding if you can't make it for some reason, so just keep in touch with them if you miss anything.Grading: You're required to submit pretty much all of the assignments in order to get an A in the class, but because you're not graded on correctness for the work you complete outside of class, this automatically saves you a lot of stress/time compared to freaking out about psets at office hours. Absolutely prioritize filling out all of the surveys for the class throughout the semester. If you complete 2 specific surveys in the beginning of the semester and then 2 again at the end, you get 6 extra credit points that can be used to boost individual assignment grades. You can use this boost once in each category (so you can use two points to boost a challenge and a tutorial, but not two challenges). You also need to use one of these points if you missed a deadline and want to submit an assignment for credit. grading is based on a 3\u2013point system; 0=no credit, 1=needs improvement, 2=A+, 3=super A+ (you can use 3's to boost 1's, also just once per category). I would try to save these for the end of the semester for when the content gets harder. You also have the option to just submit a redo request for an assignment that you already submitted that got a 0 or 1, which does not use up any of your extra credit points or 3's. IMO this is the best option because if you retain all of your 6 extra credit points, you can boost your letter grade. This class gives you so many opportunities to improve your grade.overall, i could not be more thankful that this class exists, and it is a certified premed senior spring course in my book after years of exam courses. The scheduling of the course may change next year so this is all just based on my experience, but the overall structure will stay the same and, if anything, just changes to make things easier for students. Eric is such a wonderful human being, absolutely reach out to him and talk to him when you have a chance because he rocks. also the TFs and other staff in the course are so kind and helpful. good luck!",

If you put a lot of time into it, you will do great \u2014 but you do need to set aside a significant amount of your week for the course. This includes going to section, 2.5 hours for the MCQ, 3+ hours for the LP, and then a couple hours of just general content review (which is crucial for the course, in my opinion). The MCQs (especially) and LPs are quite difficult, but they map really well onto the midterm and final. For studying for the exams, the bulk of what I did was just reviewing the MCQs and LPs, as they are very useful. In some ways, I almost found Ec1010a easier than Ec10a at times because the LPs and MCQs were so difficult, and the exams were easier in comparison. Also, definitely go to lecture and do the CRQs, as these also appear on MCQs and exams and are super helpful for deepening your knowledge. And find a study group for the MCQs early!! Overall, this course is hard but super rewarding, and you will walk a way with a very comprehensive understanding of microeconomics.",

ES 277 requires more in\u2013class work than the typical class, but it is made up for by a comparatively low homework load. I highly recommend this class to people who plan to work in microfabrication or immediately adjacent fields (e.g. circuit design, or photonics).

But anyways, I really liked it, because it's pretty much a whole semester just to write one paper, and you meet for class once a week just to check in on how you're doing and get some tips on how to do your paper better. I really liked the freedom and flexibility of this style of course. Also, Simon was such a good instructor and always gave such helpful and more importantly, specifically ACTIONABLE feedback on papers so that you'd know exactly what you have to do to get an A. Also, bc the whole semester is just writing a paper (you don't rly start till after the 5th or 6th week of the course, bc the first part of the course is kinda a super short repeat of HS 97), you should start as early as possible in writing and get as much done as you can earlier on in the process (e.g., the writing chunks often have a page minimum of 4\u20135 pages, but if you happen to have more time that week, you should do way more), bc then there will be more instances where your instructor can give you more specific feedback so that you can guarantee an A. And also, if you do it early enough, it is definitely possible to be basically done the paper by the end of thanksgiving break (if you're taking it in the fall).",

The worst part of this class in my year was the other students. This is the sort of class that attracts people from other departments who are just here because they saw \"Intellectual\" in the title and want to feel smart.

We will discuss issues ranging from formal aesthetics to historical representation, from local film industries to transnational audience reception.This course does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of film studies, but rather seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of modern East Asian cultural history through cinema, and with an essential toolkit for analyzing film and media, including narrative, cinematography, editing and sound. In addition to critical approaches, students are strongly encouraged to creatively respond to course materials by collaborating on their own short films, beginning with the illustration of film terms in the first two weeks and culminating in the \u201cGolden Monkey Awards\u201d\u2014a class screening of final projects with Oscar-like awards in various categories.As a General Education course, East Asian Cinema will help students develop aesthetic responsiveness and interpretive ability to moving images in an increasingly media-saturated world. While becoming acquainted with some analytical vocabulary and critical approaches to cinema, students will also gain insights into East Asian cultures and histories, aesthetic traditions and ethical values, as well as the politics and economics that went into the films\u2019 production and reception. Above all, the course will encourage students to be creative and enterprising with the digital media technologies at our disposal, to engage in collaborative teamwork and experiment with unorthodox ways of looking at the world through amateur filmmaking.",

I generally appreciated the environment of open dialogue and ongoing discussion. I do think that the class could benefit from more structure, based on student feedback. For example I really wanted to speak up and ask important questions about assignments and expectations, but because there was so much room and time to talk every class about popular music artists or what songs/artists were afrofuturist, it was hard to get to those questions. So take an active role in asking a lot of questions about what really matters to steer the class conversation,  which is what level of musical analysis is expected and, as an important follow\u2013up, ask for great student examples of that from her so you don\u2019t feel lost on her standards for musical and contextual analysis.",

      "This class is a wonderful introduction E&M class. It is so so so so so fantastic. Comparing this with the apphy, ps, ps12 series, I think you will do the most learning with this 15b class. It is academically challenging because it involves multivariable calculus, but I think Louis attempts to make it as painless as possible. Grade\u2013wise, sure you might not be getting the A that you wanted, but I think at the end of the day it\u2019s about the learning. If you are premed, maybe don\u2019t take about this class cuz it might drop your GPA, but I really think that if you want a good foundational understanding of E&M, this is a truly good class. There is a reason why most of the students in this class are not premeds and are more likely to be physics/engineering students All of the students are on the best no\u2013gatekeeping policy I know of. We truly help each other out, and I cannot ask for a better learning environment. As to what makes this class great:Louis \u2013 an outstanding lecturer, this is his first time he is teaching the class, so there was obvious some kinks here and there, but overall he really dumbs it down for basic understanding but then keeps all of the important details that needed to be understood there. He slows down some of the lecture material in order to ensure that no student is left behind. He posts really detailed lecture notes afterwards because the derivations can get cumbersome in class so he encourages to look at them after class to understand the steps that we took in class.Aurelian \u2013 the TF I had, the best TF I have ever had at Harvard hands down (I\u2019m a junior). A huge reason why I am no longer scared of this subject. (I was really apprehensive because of my previous physics class experience) He comes to section very well prepared. He goes over the lecture material and really dissects how we should approach a physics problem (e.g. step 1, 2, 3, \u2026) He breaks down misconceptions very well. I cannot sing enough praises for his teaching style. He lets us go off on our own for the first 5\u20137 minutes to attempt it on our own and goes around the classroom helping us out. This is also a perfect time to ask any lingering questions about the concept or the section problem. Then after those 5\u20137 minutes, he regroups the class and goes through problem, stopping to make sure we understanding the material, answering any questions we have, really encourages active participation and engagement. Other teaching staff \u2013 The amount of teaching support this class is super great. There is office hours basically every day. Shout out to Daria, Deb, Mary, Linda, Stefan, Rares, Aurelian, Louis for making this possible. Everyone was super devoted to helping students understand the course material. No question is a bad question. They prefer for you to ask your questions and settle misconceptions once and for all instead of letting these misconceptions fester. The psets are not super long, but they definitely require time, so don\u2019t leave them until physics night. I always get mine started over the weekend.Lab \u2013 confusing instructions at times, but you can get a lot more practical understanding of the concepts we learn in class in lab. It\u2019s two hours each week, so not too bad.",

The content isn't necessarily hard, but if you have never seen the linguistic symbols before, or never learned the rules of when certain processes happen in language, then this might be a fast paced course for you, as it was for me. The content is interesting, but especially at the start of the semester it will be a fair bit of reading, requiring you to read about 2 chapters in the textbook a week. If you are going to take this class, especially if you don't have that much experience with linguistics, you need to read the readings; they help explain a lot of concepts that might not be focused that much in lecture, but are needed to help your understanding of the content to come. In regards to coding in R, you are not asked to do anything crazy, but if you have never used R before, be prepared to spend lots of time troubleshooting small mistakes that will make the PSETs take so much longer than they really should have. This isn't a huge deal as we spend about 2\u20133 weeks on this, but R is needed for the final exam, so make sure you are prepared. I would say that if you are going to take the class use resources like R tutoring if you need it and office hours.",

      "Math 231BR was a wonderful course and one of my favourites this year. All aspects of the course were rewarding \u2013 Prof Hana Kong's lecturing (I know, it was at 9am but it) was superb, office hours were helpful, p sets were very challenging but were also interesting to think about \u2013 just really really good stuff.I feel like in 231A we developed a lot of interesting raw machinery that was cool to learn about in isolation but we didn't really do all that much with it, and it was only in 231BR that we really got to apply it \u2013 the general theme of 231BR revolved around studying fibre bundles, we did this in good depth and learnt a lot of interesting facts about how to make sense of their geometrical information using the theory we have developed. I think the switch of textbook from May last term to Miller this term (though of course with a few minor hiccups, for instance we were kinda expected to intuit what Postnikov/Whitehead towers were and the Brown Representability theorem was swept under the rug one or two times, but definitely not anything major) was very smart \u2013 it was a cool choice for sure having 231A be slightly more category theory heavy than necessary (with correspondingly otherwise conceptually more simple material and have easier p sets) and 231BR be more concrete with genuinely harder material to grasp and more difficult assignments, as I felt that I was sufficiently\u2013well\u2013armed in with fluency in the language and the terminology to start thinking about the more finicky concepts. Definitely would say that the material this term got a lot heavier on the detail and the machinery, and correspondingly the algebraic and geometric sides of the subject had a much more dynamic relationship than in 231A. Regardless, Professor Kong did an outstanding job in lecture and in office hours explaining the material in its most natural form, and I felt like good intuition was conveyed throughout the course for what was going on. Don\u2019t think I will ever see better teaching of spectral sequences.Do establish a good p set group going into this course though, as I feel like 231BR (even more so than 231A) was a course where trying and checking many ideas is an important part of the learning process and it is genuinely way more fun and rewarding to do this together with someone else.Overall, a great class that I recommend to everyone who enjoyed Math 231A and would like to take a first step into understanding how the tools developed there are used in the modern mathematical scene.",

    "course_description": "This course provides a comprehensive exploration of Roman history, culture, and research methodologies. It consists of three key components: a chronological survey of Roman history, beginning with the founding of Rome in the mid-8th century BCE and concluding with the dissolution of the Western Empire in the late 5th century CE; thematic examinations of crucial aspects of Roman culture and daily life, encompassing topics such as religion, economy, law and administration, technological advancements, and urban topography; and an introduction to the tools and methods utilized in Roman world research, with particular emphasis on material culture and documentary sources. The course aims to provide a robust understanding of both the historical trajectory of Rome and the intricate workings of Roman society. Students will gain valuable insights into the processes of historical inquiry through the study of physical evidence, such as artifacts and archaeological remains, as well as written records, fostering a multifaceted approach to understanding the ancient world.",

      "I cannot recommend 97B enough, particularly taught by Professor Coleman and TF'd by Alex Reed. The course readings are well\u2013varied and the lectures always interesting. The course is the perfect introduction to the ancient Roman world. Were I not already getting a secondary in the concentration, this course would have easily convinced me to do so. The course covered an immense range of material that ensured students were exposed to material, visual, and textual sources of the Ancient Roman World. Further, Professor Coleman made each lecture exciting and engaging. Her passion for the material shone and easily maintained my engagement throughout lecture. Both Professor Coleman and Alex's clear communication outside of class ensured that I never fretted over assignments. Further, I greatly enjoyed visiting the Harvard Art Museums as a class. The assignments were both rigorous and helpful in developing the range of essays I felt comfortable writing and providing new angles for me to engage with the Roman world.",

The focus is on scene and monologue work using contemporary texts from theater, television and film. Core components of the class include the idea of navigating a situation as you actually would in real life, how to read a scene or monologue to figure out what your character might want from a situation, \u201caction-based acting\u201d (how a person might go about getting what they want from the other person), how to find a personal connection to a character, and how to choose material that best suits the individual actor for auditions and scene work. The focus is on scene and monologue work as well as learning how to audition.\u00a0We\u2019ve designed the class around very tangible and concrete ideas and techniques, so that those who might be intimidated by the idea of an acting class, or an arts class in general, will feel exceedingly comfortable. We always have a lot of students from non-art concentrations who have had no previous art class experience, and they have found the process quick and easy to learn. It is important to note that while the class is intentionally designed to be un-intimidating, friendly and warm, the class does require a great deal of outside work. Students should expect to spend 4-6 hours per week outside of class, including memorization and rehearsal time for scenes and monologues.",

      "Actually stay away from this class!!The structure and delivery of Math 132 under Dr. Gammage's instruction have proven to be a significant challenge for many students. The course, while rich in potential for advanced learning, often glosses over the derivation and proof of key theorems, which are frequently described as \"trivial.\" This approach can hinder the depth of understanding necessary for a rigorous mathematical education, especially in a complex subject like differential topology.Students have expressed concerns regarding the instructor's responsiveness to questions during class. There appears to be a tendency to not adequately address or engage with inquiries that would clarify and enrich the student learning experience. Greater openness to student questions and a more thorough exploration of the topics at hand could enhance understanding and academic success.The workload for this course is notably substantial, with students reportedly dedicating upwards of 20 hours per week to problem sets alone. While a rigorous workload can be beneficial, it is important that it be balanced and manageable, and that it genuinely contributes to student learning and comprehension rather than merely adding to the students' stress.The overall student experience in Math 132 this semester has been overwhelmingly stressful, with many feeling that their educational needs are not being met. An adjustment in teaching approach, particularly a more supportive and engaging classroom environment and a reconsideration of the workload, could potentially improve outcomes and student satisfaction significantly.",

      "Incredible class! Demarco is the best you could hope for. The course is a great introduction to pure math for anyone with absolutely no background in it. It assumes no prior knowledge and really builds up your proof\u2013writing abilities from ground zero. Demarco's lecture notes are wonderful, and the other texts in the course basically just provide further detail. The p\u2013sets are pretty difficult, especially at the beginning, but they seem to get easier throughout the semester as you get the hang of things. I would say the level of the problems was pretty perfect, because it felt challenging and interesting but it really was something that we would be able to do. The CA's are really great and offer tons of OH for when you are stuck. The structure of the classes is that the first half or so is lecture, then you spend the next half working in groups on worksheet problems (usually short proofs). It is super valuable practice and a great time to get feedback from CA's. There was even more practice available in the weekly sections. Exams were not as challenging as homeworks and did not feel too rushed for a class period. All of this feedback comes with the caveat that things may be different under a different instructor, and Demarco won't be teaching next year. However, I think this class is generally well\u2013run and a good introduction to the field if you have an interest. Also, if you ever get a chance to take a class with Demarco, take it!!",

If you follow along in class & go to section(please to go section, it\u2019s where you\u2019ll learn how to apply the concepts learned in class and also go over problems that are analogous to the ones on the pset. Also, our TF Mehar was amazing, but she is graduating so not sure who the TF will be next year. Your TF will absolutely make or break your success in this class!!), you\u2019ll be okay on the psets, and they don\u2019t take very long. Pset 3 was definitely by far the most tedious pset, so please budget extra time for it. There is a long reading list for this class, but honestly, you can get by without having read any of the readings \u2014 just pay attention in class, especially during Unit 4 because the essay prompts on the final exam will be largely based off of Unit 4. Lecture can be hard to follow and confusing at times, and I know many people who skipped lecture often and still did well on the psets. I would encourage going to lecture if you can though, we play a lot of fun in class games (if you win you get money too!) that demonstrate the theory we are learning. The class overall can feel an unstructured sometimes, but I took away many lessons from game theory overall, and would recommend with slight reservations. if you want a more in\u2013depth understanding of game theory, I would probably take another class. However, if you\u2019re looking for a chill introduction, this is it! Learn a decent amount, light workload, and great vibes overall!",

      "This is the best course I've ever taken at Harvard. Never before have I seen a course staff (Especially Heidi) who care so much about students. This semester we worked on molecular glue synthesis. I learned organic lab techniques (Biotage, HPLC, inert atmosphere, etc), but my bigger takeaways were with how synthesis research is done. We gave group meeting presentations, annotated spectra, and wrote supporting information for our compounds (like for a paper). The poster presentation at the end seemed daunting but each step was broken down and honestly was not too stressful because of the support the staff gave. You also have a Lab Partner to split most assignments with!!The science advocacy component of this class was cool and definitely do the DC trip if you sign up! Talking to staffers and congressmen/senators was a cool experience.I loved the community the class produces. The 10 students this semester really forged strong friendships in this class and this was a powerful experience.Advice: do as much of the work/assignments in class so you can ask any questions if you are unsure or get stuck. You can leave the lab early and go home, but I usually stayed till the end to finish the assignments and basically not have research work outside of class. Workload is very fair for this class.Side Note: Chem 135 (experimental synthetic organic chemistry) is taught alongside Chem 100r. Chem 135 is a smaller and faster\u2013paced course with more advanced labs, but does not have the science advocacy component (this may change) and also at least in this iteration of the course was less project\u2013based. Students in Chem 135 tend to have more organic research experience, though it is not necessary by any means and the TFs will help you if you don't in either class!",

      "If you are thinking about taking Chem17 vs Chem20, choose chem20. You will not regret it one bit. 1) Your grade will be ok/about the same in both classes. A lot of people (pre\u2013meds) worry about their grade and think that Chem20 might give them a worse grade than Chem17. The reality is that most students in both classes end up with A/A\u2013. Chem20 has harder exams/lower exam averages, but your final course grade is curved, so it turns out perfectly fine. 2) You get a deeper understanding of chemistry with Chem20. Chem20 takes the time to introduce MO theory immediately and goes into greater depth on why each reaction you learn happens. It begins to teach you chemical intuition so that you can look at a molecule and immediately have some idea of its reactivity. In short, the course teaches organic chemistry by logic and reasoning rather than sheer memorization. 3) The course materials are FAR superior to Chem17 or ANY course you've ever taken. I'm not kidding. The course is so organized that you get 2 booklets on day 1: a bound booklet of the lecture notes that you fill in during lectures and second, a book of practice questions for each module of material. The exams, problem sets, and practice questions are all similar, so definitely do the practice questions. There are so many practice questions that mimic the conceptual and the synthesis questions on the actual exams very well. 4) Lab is actually sort of fun. The head lab TF Dominic will hopefully still be there. Dominic and Co. make lab super chill but still informative. The course  is a bit weird in that lab doesn't seem to count a lot towards your final grade, but imo, this actually helps you focus on lab and really enjoy learning the techniques (whether you end up using them in your future career or not).5) You get so much support. The TFs, PSLs, and ofc Professor Liu are all so willing to explain concepts/exam problems to help you improve over time. Actually, the best part is that you are assigned Pset groups with other students. This means that, unlike many other classes where you may struggle to find people to work with, you start the class with a pset group. ALSO after every exam, there is a group exam where you get to get some points back on the exam by working in another assigned group. The group is randomly assigned and changes each exam. This means that you get to know pretty much everyone in the class.Tldr: Take the course. Grade will be fine. You learn SO MUCH. All assignments are designed to prepare you well for exams/teach you a lot. You make many friends. Keep in mind that as we write these reviews, we have no clue what our final grade will be (that's the case for all classes). I've had some cases where I write positive reviews for classes, get a bad final grade, and regret writing that review. I'm here to say that regardless of my final grade (which again will be fine), I would 100% recommend this class to everyone who has any slight interest in chemistry at all.",

      "This is honestly a pretty good course and an excellent way to complete your language requirement. The fact that you receive 8 credits for one course and satisfy the language requirement in one semester makes it a \"really good deal.\" That offering for this course is completely merited though. You really do learn the full contents of French 10 and French 11 and leave the course as a shockingly decent French speaker. The course is well\u2013structured, though there are times where it feels like you may learn a bit ahead of the pace of course as it takes time to get to tenses/grammatical phrases. The idea of having everyone create a character in a Parisian appartment building is unique and makes the course a bit more fun. All the work that's completed for the class genuinely does improve your French ability.You'll leave this course ideally at the B1 CEFR level which is pretty good. I actually feel like I can somewhat speak French now and that's pretty remarkable for just a semester of work. Showing up to a class 5 days a week isn't for everyone (and when they say 5 days a week, they really mean 5 days a week since the syllabus allows for very few missed classes). Fortunately, our class met at 12pm which isn't too early, though attendance may be more challenging if this course is offered at an earlier time in the future. I have few criticisms of this course. It did always feel weird that it was run by Dr. Mills technically even though it didn't seem people in the course interacted with her. Anselme, the actual teacher, was excellent and cared about our learning French and fully addressing all our questions. Another thing is that you'd expect a class with ~15 people meeting every weekday to cause people to forge some strong friendships, but, to me, it seemed like everyone in the class liked each other, but that nobody was particularly close. That's not even a strong criticism, just a counterintuitive observation.If you're interested in French, want to get your language requirement done, or like learning quickly: take this course! It's pretty well\u2013run, you'll learn a lot of French, and the 8 credits is pretty nice. The grading always feels fair, and as long as you attend and submit things on time, you'll probably do very well. The one strong piece of advice I have is to do all of the homework exercises each week. They don't take very long, and while you could just look at the answer key, I don't think most people do because it's a very good learning tool. I always took my time on the exercises and then corrected them after because it always filled gaps in my knowledge in a pretty efficient amount of time and also prepared me well for the quizzes. I'm glad I took this course, and look forward to being able to speak more French. I originally dreaded dealing with my foreign language requirement, but after my positive experience in French 15, I may take more French classes at Harvard.",

Second to that, another one of favorite aspects of this class was the guest lectures; Professor Shleifer invites quality guest lecturers to present on timely topics, and it aids in the diversity of the content that we consume in the course.

      "This is the worst course that I've taken at Harvard. The flaws are numerous: 1. Should not be taught in IRAF. Modern astrophysics is done in python, leaving this course is very outdated.2. Course structure: it was always very unclear what tasks were required/graded, and most assignments were submitted through email...?3. Final project is very undirected. No assignment requirements or rubrics are provided, despite it almost entirely determining our grade.4. Final project support is minimal, but not at fault of the TFs. After completing data reduction, groups are left to do data analysis on their own (and all groups chose to do it in Python, as this is the modern coding language of astrophysics), but because each group is doing a different type of project, the TFs are not able to help very much. 5. After spring break, class time becomes equivalent to office hours, but attendance is still mandatory.6. Introductory lectures do not offer any educational value as they are, largely, covering material that is a prerequisite for the class.7. First half of the course is spent going through IRAF \"documents,\" which are outdated, riddled with typos and errors, and impossible to go through individually. They do not incentivize learning as they require dependence upon TFs \u2013 you get too bogged down in the outdated software to learn anything meaningful.8. I have not received any written feedback, in any form, for a single assignment this entire semester.The spring break trip to Arizona is pretty fun, especially if you have friends in the class. However, with the numerous glaring issues that this course presents, I do not think that it is anywhere near worth it.If you are considering taking this class to satisfy astro requirements, take any other course in the department before this one.

    "course_description": "The Religion and Public Life Capstone seminar is restricted to students pursuing a Certificate in Religion and Public Life and should be taken following successful completion of HDS 3300 and HDS 4000A/B. Each student is required to complete a final project related to their area of professional concentration and will work in close collaboration with other seminar participants, a final project advisor, and the Assistant Dean of Religion and Public Life who is the lead instructor of the seminar. Final projects will vary depending on the area of concentration pursued but all must demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the relevance of the public understanding of religion in particular contexts. Options may include (but are not limited to) constructing a series of case studies focused on a particular profession or context; creating educational resources for a specific audience; writing a policy brief for a particular organization; producing a podcast, or creating other kinds of media. Prospective students are required to submit a final project proposal (that has been approved by their project advisor) to the Assistant Dean of Religion and Public Life by midnight on the last day of reading period in the fall term. The Assistant Dean may request revisions and final project proposals (approved by their project advisors and the Assistant Dean of Religion and Public Life) should be submitted to the Associate Dean of Religion and Public Life by midnight of the first day of spring classes. Project advisors can be drawn from the following constituencies: current or former Religion and Public Life Fellows (professionals who co-teach HDS 3300 and mentor students); a visiting scholar; a HDS voting faculty member, or others offering instruction at HDS. Note: M.Div students who wish to fulfill the CRPL capstone requirement with their M.Div Senior Project must alert the Assistant Dean of Religion and Public Life of this intention when they are preparing their M.Div project proposal in the spring term prior to their final year. See CRPL Handbook for further information about this option. Prerequisites: HDS 3300 and HDS 4000AB",

By surveying social theory as well as empirical studies, students acquire what C.

We examine common-sense assumptions about culture, politics, history, and psychology, and empower students to replace them with evidence-based reasoning. This gateway course introduces students to the intellectual insights and analytical tools of Sociology across the subfields of race, class, gender, politics, violence, culture, and inequality. Students are trained to critically analyze the evidence and research methods used in sociological research, and to communicate sociological ideas powerfully and succinctly through effective policy writing. Whether you plan to become a doctor who understands the social determinants of health, an education expert seeking to improve US schools, a not-for-profit worker supporting community organization, or a corporate consultant looking to improve organizational efficiency, the foundational concepts and research practices of sociology will empower you to understand, analyze\u2014and maybe even change\u2014our social world.",

In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary-critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, \u2018Course Schedule\u2019, for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader issues: metaphysics, politics, inequality, race, colonialism/imperialism, the white gaze. You will not only have read the assigned text with critical rigor but also taken notes of the points you want to raise in class. While I do not expect you to hand in short critical essays on the texts, I will be looking for engaged, alert discussions, so it may help to have something written down to facilitate our conversations. Please note: Reading the assigned text is obligatory. Previous Creative Writing workshop experience is desirable. If you\u2019re writing YA fantasy, there are other courses on offer that would be a better fit.In the second half of the class, divided into two equal segments of 55 minutes each, we will be workshopping the writing of two students. To this end, every week two students will hand in something they have written, to the tune of 2,500-5,000 words, to me and to everyone in the group, ideally one week before their turn. At our first meeting, I will circulate a rota for you to put down your names and walk you through the syllabus, the aims and objectives of the course, workshop rules, expectations, requirements etc. For our first workshopping session, two students should hand in work five to seven days before. Our goal is for each of you to have two turns, and approximately 5-10,000 words of your work critiqued, by the time semester ends. Copies of these writing samples will be returned to you at the end of each workshop with comments from me and from everyone in class. Work submitted must be single-sided, double-spaced, paginated and, ideally, bearing a title.

      "Absolutely take this class. It is the most well\u2013taught STEM class I've taken at Harvard as a CS concentrator. It covers the same foundational material (and CS concentration requirement) as STAT 110 without as much pain. This is largely due to Professor Lu's excellent teaching and the very organized class structure. Lectures are no\u2013fluff, clear, informative, and informal enough that everyone is comfortable asking questions.The content itself is extremely applicable to any field (CS, any engineering application, reading papers, poker / gambling, finance). Every lecture, you walk out knowing something new, useful, and understand how you can use it in the real world. That's not something that happens much in most Harvard CS courses.PSETs and labs are challenging, but very doable. They feel like puzzles in the optimal level of difficulty. Exams open note, very fair, and their content is clearly communicated before hand. The course notes on Overleaf are very comprehensive and a great way to review.Lecture is the highlight of this course. I wish Professor Lu taught more courses. I found myself thinking, \"wow if he taught some of my other courses, they would be so much better!\"",

If you like working in small groups on worksheets instead of just sitting in a lecture, this is the course for you! I felt a lot more comfortable working in a smaller group to solve problems rather than just going into homeworks blind about what solving astrophysics problems entail. The midterm and final were barely like a test at all, the structure of them was essentially people come in to visit the course who have a wide range of backgrounds and in small groups you work to talk about the problems with them. As someone who always struggles on tests due to anxiety, I really enjoyed this method because it never felt like there was any negative outcomes. If you have trouble explaining a problem, another group member or even a CA/TF/Prof would help you out, which I really enjoyed since it felt more welcoming. The problems sets were a bit all over the place in terms of difficulty, but the CAs and TFs were super helpful in answering questions and helping out. I would recommend this course if you can commit to going to essentially every class and if you like learning, because this course is tailored to the learning and solving experience rather than tests.",

      "TL;DR: Chem 30 is the hardest class I've ever taken, but is super rewarding. Professor Myers is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff, but be prepared to spend A LOT of time on this class memorizing the material. Here's how the course worked for me: in class, Professor Myers presented a flurry of mechanisms and reactions, and I quickly copied those down (be prepared to write fast). I didn't really understand them the first time around (this is okay) because it's a challenge to keep up with Myers' pace, but it's nothing to worry about Next, I would attempt the Lecture Integration problems (a short worksheet based on the new content from the last lecture that is due every lecture)  to test my knowledge. Then, I would look over the pset and see how much I remembered, and do the first few problems. Then, I would look back at the lecture boards / lecture recordings as a guide, and attempt all the other problems, and go to office hours and check everything one more time before submitting my pset. For tests, there are ample practice materials, but be sure to do ALL of them: I know I definitely needed the practice. If you do all the practice materials, the exams will feel fair and simple.Chem 30 is a HARD class, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Everyone is pretty much in the same boat: you will need to memorize a LOT of reactions, but it all feels fun and new. Your synthetic capabilities will grow exponentially compared to just having taken Chem 20. Finally, the community in the course is excellent. The teaching staff is absolutely stellar: they are super qualified and really know their stuff. The other students are also struggling through the same content you are, so it's not hard to make new friends. All in all, Chem 30 demands a large time commitment, but is an awesome class with great people.",
      "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I really enjoyed Chem 20, but this class is a mess and the high reviews on the Q guide are very misleading because it is filled with Chemistry majors that will rank chemistry classes high regardless of whether it is a good class. If you are not a chemistry major, I would highly advise taking Chem 27 instead. I think the optimal series is Chem 20 and then Chem 27.There are many problems with Chem 20:1) it is simply a memorization game\u2013\u2013there are hundreds of reactions given to you and you simply have to memorize the reagents involved, the mechanisms involved, and when to use them. Any one of them could show up at any time, on any assignment. Unlike Chem 20 where I felt like I was learning a new way of thinking about chemistry, this course was just drilling reaction after reaction into my brain, which wasn't fun or rewarding. If you took Chem 20, you have already learned how to do synthesis; you don't need this class to advance that skill.2) The structure of this course is really bad all around. First, don't let the 2x a week lectures fool you. These lectures consist of Professor Myers writing reaction after reaction after reaction after reaction on the board. Then it is entirely on you to actually learn the material. You will retain essentially nothing in lecture and Professor Myers does nothing to engage students during the lectures. Second, EVERYTHING IS ON PAPER, which may sound fine, but it gets really frustrating because you have to print everything (the daily lecture problems and the problem sets) if you do work on the iPad. This was a bit crazy for 2024. Third, there was often complex material on the problem sets that was taught the day before the long PSETS were due, which meant trying to watch youtube videos that covered the material or begging CAs for the answers because there just wasn't enough time to wait to actually learn the material in class.3) Some of the exam questions were unfair and covered material that wasn't taught. After we got the test back, I tried to find where some of the material was in the course materials and frequently it just wasn't there. The material is hard enough that asking about material that wasn't taught or introduced is a bit unfair.____________Finally, if you are premed, this class is not a way around the 17/27 series. You will learn more and find the material more interesting in the Chem 17/27 classes. This class is very hard and filled with people who have been doing chemistry their entire life (olympiad kids and international chemistry kids), so even if the curve is slightly more generous, you are taking this class with an entirely different population of people than Chem 17 and 27. Please keep this in mind.",

In terms of getting a strong grade, if you have a solid background in math then you can for sure get an A if you obviously take the necessary time on the PSETs. Wes also wants to encourage rigorous mathematics, as people who have only taken the Math 21 series can take this class. You have to get 20 Group 2 points throughout the semester (so averaging roughly 2 a PSET), and you can get extra credit from going over 20 (maxing out at 28). The class also has 2 midterms and a final. They vary in difficulty, but they are certainly fair.  They are all open\u2013note, take\u2013home & unlimited time for a week. They are structured almost like a PSET. The final was definitely more challenging than the two midterms. The course heads also took latex notes, which was very helpful (and so attending class was not a necessity). Wes also wrote the textbook we used in this class.

Do smartphones and the Internet help our memories or hurt them? Are traumatic experiences especially well remembered or are they poorly remembered? What are the best ways to study for exams? This seminar will address these and other questions related to the fallibility of memory by considering evidence from studies of healthy people with normal memories, brain-damaged patients who show dramatic forgetting or striking memory distortions, and neuroimaging studies that reveal brain regions and networks that are linked to memory.\u00a0 The framework for the seminar is provided by the idea that the misdeeds of memory can be classified into seven basic \"sins\". Three of the memory sins refer to different kinds of forgetting (transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking), three refer to different kinds of distortions or false memories (misattribution, suggestibility, and bias) and the final sin refers to intrusive recollections (persistence). We will consider how the memory sins impact everyday life and discuss the possibility that they can be conceptualized as by-products of adaptive features of memory, rather than as flaws in the system or blunders made by Mother Nature during evolution.\u00a0 Relatedly, we will also discuss the interplay between remembering past experiences and imagining future experiences, which provides clues regarding the nature and fallibility of memory.",

The projects are super interesting and very free form \u2013 you can work on what you are interested in (you will know better what interests you as a senior than as a freshman!). The grading does not seem excessively punishing at all, the Prof is super passionate for the subject and just wants to see you give it a good go. The first p set is very challenging and daunting, but dont be afraid \u2013 p sets are not weekly, there are only four total, and they get easier. Overall would strongly recommend the class even outside of its implications for the AM degree, modeling is a fantastic skillset and is taught passionately and not arduously here.",

      "I said it last semester, and I'll say it again: Whether or not you're a math major, take 55. I said most of what I have to say in the 55a Q Report, and most of it still applies, but I'll add a few things:First of all, the course community is very, very friendly, collaborative, and supportive. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Harvard or a better course to define my first year here. This class was my least stressful class this semester, so don't worry about it at all. If you put in the effort, you will be fine. Professor Harris is amazing \u2014 take anything he teaches \u2014 and I'm sure Auroux will be wonderful next year, too. Ask the CAs for help if you're ever stuck, and you will succeed.I would hesitate to recommend taking 55b without 55a. You can probably quite easily catch up content wise (just go over what a group is!), but I think that 55a builds a certain level of mathematical maturity that most non\u201355 first\u2013years lack. Without that, you will probably struggle in 55b.That said, whether or not you took 55a \u2014 55b is easier. It is less work, and, in my opinion, the content is more fun. Topology and complex analysis are beautiful subjects, and 55 provides a wonderful, engaging introduction to both, preparing you for courses like 213 and 231.",

This class is SO interesting and I can't stop talking about what I've learned with my roommates/family/anyone who will listen. It made me wish I had studied HEB instead!!

      "I am going to focus this review on things first\u2013year students who have placed into Chinese 120a should know. I feel that this is a very good but rather challenging class, especially as a first\u2013year. The workload is equivalent to a pset class, as you have a weekly homework assignment that takes time. On the homework, do the extra credit every single time. It takes only 5 minutes but it will make a huge difference for your grade. There is also a quiz every single Tuesday and Thursday, which covers content for the NEXT lesson (not the previous one). Keep this in mind when you consider your workload and which classes you want to take. The assignments are very much focused on reading, writing, and grammar. I came from a conversationally\u2013focused Chinese program in high school, so this was a big shift for me. If you don't feel confident in your reading and writing (typing) abilities, I would suggest taking Ba or Bb if you want a less demanding experience.  The project is worth a significant proportion of your grade, so do not blow it off. If you use it as an opportunity to genuinely learn about Chinese culture,  you will love it!Do not be discouraged if you perform poorly on the review tests or midterm. They are very hard but  there are plenty of other assignments and  extra credit opportunities to help your grade. The final exam is very hard, too. The instructors are all incredible teachers and care so deeply about their students' success in this class. I cannot say enough good things about them. They are always willing to help, and also make class into a fun environment. A highlight was the tea party they had for us. Because I took a very challenging set of classes this semester, there is a small part of me that wishes I took a lower level class. However, I am ultimately glad I took 120a because I truly learned so much and had a great experience thanks to the instructors. Overall, if you decide to take this class, you will have to work hard but you will have a great time while doing it and also make some great friends along the way.",

You will engage in communicative and interpretive tasks, while exploring a variety of authentic material (e.g. short texts, music, videos, visuals) from various sources (e.g. social media, TV programs, YouTube videos). By the end of the semester, you will have developed the linguistic and cultural competence sufficient to express yourself, participate in conversations on familiar topics, and handle short social interactions in Portuguese.

      "My experience with this is complicated because I think the department is great, and nearly all of the teachers are fantastic. If your TF/prof is Marcia or Jaqueline or Chris, I'm sure your experience will be great and you should disregard anything else I say about the class.Having a different TF who was new, I found the class incredibly difficult, not because it was a lot of work or the material was very hard but because I felt like I had to teach myself the material and I never understood what I was supposed to learn or what the expectations were. I was so looking forward to this class because I know it has been phenomenal in recent years but it was honestly the worst class I've taken at Harvard. That being said, I really do have faith that it will become a great course again. I would suggest just listening to your gut about your TF in the first few weeks because I think it is likely that the teaching staff will change from semester to semester. If you feel like the course is really not working for you, then just drop it. Please do not use what I have said as a reason to not try this course because you will be missing a great opportunity. In many sections, this course is super fun and educational. All I am saying is that if you're unsure, just shop the class and if you don't vibe with the TF then drop it, but DO SIGN UP (and it you have any concerns, please contact the course staff because they are incredible).  Takeaway: the Portuguese department is fantastic. This class will probably be great, but TFs matterPLEASE GO TO LANGUAGE TABLE \u2013 it can make the entire course experience. I know it's hard to commit to an extra thing but I swear its worth it. Choose that over studying if you have to",

      "BE PREPARED TO WORK! This is no longer a super easy class, and in fact, most students struggled a lot under Julie. Keep in mind that the class is drastically changing for next semester and future years, so not everything here will be applicable.Firstly, the class was a flipped classroom, meaning you watched a video of Julie teaching you coding and statistics, and that was super boring and unhelpful. You also will have weekly quizzes, but don't worry about missing points, you get the chance to make up wrong answers at the end of the semester. The exams are NOT take home, unlike other intro statistics classes like STAT 104. The in\u2013person midterm was MISERABLE, but the final was much more fair. If you did better on your final, your midterm score basically disappears which is nice. Overall, this class is super helpful in teaching you data analysis in R. However, it will be hard! Please please please go to office hours and make a true connection with them. They are so amazing and super fair with grading! They taught me the most in this class and NOT the videos Julie posted. So please, go to office hours!!! I went to at least 10 hours every week to get my psets done because there was just no other way. ALSO, be aware this class has no curve! But an A is still possible as I was able to pull it off with no coding experience.",

      "I think most people would say that this year's iteration of CS161 was perhaps not as difficult as folklore would have you think \u2013 I certainly suffered more in CS124 than in 161, although I suppose 124 has the safety net of somebody, somewhere will have the key insight or just the outright solution to a PSET, whereas in these sorts of classes, chatting to someone who has done the whole problem set might help you avoid some pitfalls, but you still have to put in the time to write the thing. I guess I should caveat that I took 165 the previous semester, and my experience there I think probably saved me a perhaps 1\u20133 hours on average per PSET, just from having some familiarity with GDB and instantly writing a good logging system (something I did way too late into 165, here it was the first thing I wrote and that was certainly a good decision).Eddie as always is a wonderful professor; he generally makes you think he has some boundless knowledge vault locked away in his head regarding everything related to systems. And we don't even need to talk about anything that follows `emacs \u2013nw`. Anyone who writes such fabled characters in 2024 should probably either be worshipped or feared.Getting to build a reasonable sized portion of an operating system is awesome, the PSETs are obviously time consuming but honestly not even close to as overwhelming as I was expecting. I took this partly to build some familiarity with C++, and I definitely felt like I gained some of that, along with some good practice in GDB if either of those appeal to you.Overall, very much enjoyed, maybe a bit burnt out taking this and some other moderately time\u2013consuming stuff in senior spring, but I'm not sure there's a better final assignment to hand in as a CS concentrator as your operating system final project (even if mine was pretty meh) and be able to call yourself done with Harvard :)",

Professor Siu was an unreasonable lecturer, leaving  every single student confused and lost in every lecture, while showing little to no empathy. The lights in our classroom (which are motion sensored), would often turn off multiple times in class, because no one was paying attention. Prof. Siu didn\u2019t care that his students were lost \u2013 he only cared about getting through the material. Our TFs were also equally lost, and openly admitted that they did not know what was going on in 113. Our TFs also shared that we learned everything taught in Math 213, the graduate level version of this course. It felt unfair at many times throughout the course when our TFs were unable to explain concepts learned in class, or answer questions in office hours. That being said, the material learned in 113 with Prof. Siu was absolutely beautiful. Complex analysis is such an elegant area of mathematics, and you really feel proud of yourself after completing each problem set, which were all extremely difficult. While it bothers me that this course was not taught at an appropriate pace, this is still probably my favorite course taken at Harvard. The material really is so beautiful, and I am actually thankful that Prof. Siu truly pushed everyone to their limits. Because of this, my mathematics skills flourished exponentially.

      "TLDR: Take this class \u2013 my favorite class of all time! At the end of this course you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian very well at a basic level! I now feel confident to strike up a conversation and can hold my own. If you're unsure just pull up to the first class, you'll love it so much you'll stay!(Much) Longer version:Professor:\u2013 Dima (Dmitrii), the professor, is the best professor of all time. Seriously he cares so much, he's incredible enthusiastic, and makes the course an incredible amount of fun. He is the greatest professor I've ever had and should be a tenured professor with several awards named after him. With him, you don't just learn the language. As you learn more Russian in terms of grammar, vocab, and speaking you will also learn poems, songs, watch a movie, record a video, and read a story! You don't just learn the language but appreciate and learn about the culture. \u2013 Dima and Roy (the TF) put in so much work and make it so fun and easy for you to learn. Definitely some of the best and hard working faculty on this campus.If you're thinking of taking this course:1) Go to the first day \u2013 if you love it like I did, you'll likely stay but please go \u2013 it's incredible2) Yes it is actually 2 courses worth of work \u2013 see the structure (if you really want to think of it as 1 course think about it this course has around the same or higher median amount of work outside of class as notorious classes like \u2013 Stat110, EC1011a, Chem 27, CS 124 \u2013 but instead of 3h of class a week you have 8h).  I.e. think of it as 2 classes and you'll be fine since then it's closer to 2 medium classes work or 1.5 hard classes. If you're between doing Russ AAB (8 credit) vs AA (4 credit) here's what to know:1) you will spend 8h of class instead of 5h and do 1.5\u20132x the work but move through double the material. You learn much more, become more fluent and it's epic.2) At the end of the semester you will know all the Russian cases and be able to understand and speak basic Russian really well (fluency is gained not only by how much time you spend learning but also but in what timeframe, i.e. doing 2x the work in the same time results in learning more than 2x quicker)3) The students who take this really want to be here. They came to learn the language and so people are more focused, interesting and you learn from each otherIf you want to talk to people who have taken the course/are unsure:\u2013 Talk to Dr Clancy and/or Dima AND ask them to connect you with students who have taken the course \u2013 they are happy to and we are happy to give you our unfiltered takes (which is we loved it but we'll also be real about the amount of work and if this course is right for you).Structure (and to give an idea of what the time breakdown looks like):\u2013 To start with the reason you have so much work is because if you do the work you will learn \u2013 it's intentionally structured this way. This isn't like other classes where you need to put in time outside of the homework to actually learn. \u2013 8h of class a week of which 3h is small speaking section (usually like 1:30 or like 10:30 or some combo but happens MWF) and 5x normal class every morning. The small speaking sections will fit around your schedule don't worry. Not sure who the TF will be but they will teach Tuesday and Thursday mornings and grade assignments while Dima will teach the small speaking sections as well as the MWF mornings.\u2013 Approx 2h a day of HW for Mon\u2013Thurs \u2013 Friday you have a vocab test (you should spend like 20m a day studying)\u2013 Weekly (take home) unit tests which take more or less 1h\u2013 Check your HW and Unit tests after they've been graded to learn from errors\u2013 Midterm and Final (Oral and written) \u2013 Dima has practice exams which are super useful!!(If we're being honest, even though you should, you're probably not doing it EVERY day, but try space it out, maybe do it in 2 or 3 sessions in a week \u2013 DO NOT leave it for one day a week, you will feel behind all week, spend the entire Sunday working, and it's not fun)Grades:\u2013 Like most language at Harvard, don't worry \u2013 if you learn the language (which you will), you will do well. (no I will not be elaborating but when I say don't worry about the grade I truly mean it because if you instead just learn the language you will do great and have fun).\u2013 I mean you're not really taking this course because you are worried about a grade but rather you want to learn the language... BUT this course doesn't have tricks it's straightforward with course staff who want you to success and at no point is there surprises or are you trying to be caught out. Other vibes:\u2013 The Russian Students Society host fun and epic events and get to meet and practice Russian.\u2013 The Slavic Languages program have fun events like the weekly Lowell Language Table, crepe making etc. The faculty are uber accessible and it's always a good time.\u2013 The Davis Center for Eurasian studies has awesome events you should attend to learn more about politics, people, region.",

      "Use the office hours and all the office hours. The psets can be weird since they are asking you questions 'you'd likely have to answer when doing science' but they are somewhat interesting. The exams are HARD.  This is not a class where the exams ar easier than the practice exams. Make sure you know the equations inside and out, Ince they hardly asked you to solve for stuff you have never solved for before :)I consider this class to be a semi\u2013grad class. You need a background in biology, some chem (not that much), physics, and math (at the level of 1b). These classes are not requirements but will go a long way in your success in the course. The good thing is that you have 3 teachers and a TF and not that many students. My advice would be to make the most out of office hours. It is easy to get lost in one of the concepts but office hours are always there to help.This course will have to be the center of your universe during the semester if you want a chance of getting and A. Very useful for structural biology though. You finished the class feeling like a pro a pymol. If you are doing any type of research involving proteins, this is the course to take.",

      "Going into SOCIOL 97, I was nervous about taking a sociological theory course and what the courseload would look like. Honestly, I think the hardest part of the course is in the first couple weeks because you get thrown off the deep end a little bit with Weber, Durkheim, and Marx all in a row. I felt quite confused and getting lost in the dense theory, but I think the teaching staff does a great job of guiding you through it and helping you understand their theoretical traditions/perspectives. I ultimately feel like it was worth it to learn about them, even though it was challenging at first, because I'm glad to have a working understanding of the canonical sociological theories as a jumping off point for my future interaction with sociology and the social sciences in general. Basically, this class is not a bad class to fulfill a requirement and the teaching staff is quite understanding and accommodating (Jane is a great TF). It might feel slightly intimidating at first, but after the first few weeks the theories become much easier to read and grasp, so don't worry!",

      "My first official course in Number Theory, Math 129 was a very challenging experience. By the end of the course I was able to look back on it and say that I'm glad I did it and that a lot of the theorems learnt were very interesting and beautiful, but somehow while I was taking the course this definitely did not seem like the case.For a little background, I came in to the course initially due to my curiosity with how seemingly completely innocuous questions (Fermat's Last Theorem looking at you) could drive humanity to develop such an incredibly rich subject, and while I did sort of find a bit of closure on that question (through doing my presentation which was one of favourite parts of the course), I was (very surprised) to find that during my experience of actually taking the course, I was really struggling to understand the motivation behind a lot of the material. Long story short, a combination of the p sets being bashy (I say this as someone who is also interested in physics btw \u2013 some of the most horrendous matrix manipulation you will ever see is on Math 129 p sets) and very disconnected from lecture, lecture being very bizarrely structured (Prof Mazur did in fact introduce a lot of great things to keep in mind \u2013 you just never understood why they are important the first time they are brought up), and the book being exceedingly annoying to navigate (a running joke amongst people who have taken this course is the fact that every single time you are doing work for Math 129, you need at least 5 tabs of Marcus open at the same time just to do one part of one p set problem), somehow made the material feel like a massive slog during the course, which is a great shame because I definitely did not expect things to feel this way.  (P. S. the exams are both hard and sit down, so if you're anything like me who has the memory of a guinea pig expect to have to do a crap ton of memorisation of definitions and proofs to practice for the exams \u2013 didn't really give it my best effort tbph and I TANKED; will leave it up to you to decide whether that's your cup of tea, especially in a subject that in my opinion is one of the harder ones to gain good intuition for)Other than everything I just mentioned though, I thought the course was really good \u2013 Prof Mazur (as I said earlier) is a legendary figure in the subject and being in his presence was very humbling. He says a lot of good things and is very to the point with his students, which I think is something that is unfortunately missing in this day and age; the TF team was fantastic, but special mention to Eric Shen who did a fantastic job preparing review materials for the course, answering my questions and helping me understand things in a way that I was able to better appreciate both the small details and the broader view of where the material fit in, all while being his usual humble and caring self. With regards to grading, I must say initially found TF Eliot Hodges' grading rubric about \"writing\" very annoying, but tbh by the end of the course I actually appreciated it \u2013 it was nice to get someone with more experience to keep me accountable and help me understand what was and what was not accepted as formal mathematical exposition. The material itself is beautiful \u2013 its got a different feel to it than some of the more theory\u2013oriented maths courses here like algebra/topology/analysis. Initially I was frustrated because it just seemed like we were being handed a bag of tools for random bashing \u2013 but I would say that by the end the theory started to come together and the role, significance and true nature of each tool became much more apparent. It is, however, for me, hard to grasp, as a lot of the mathematics itself was really quite involved \u2013 multiple\u2013lecture\u2013long proofs were common (with like 3 asides and 4 presentations sandwiched between them just so to make it even harder to figure out what was going on, obviously), as were definitions and theorems that had so many pieces to them that it is almost comical trying to describe them verbally to someone else (just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about, one of the statements of the theorems starts with \"Let K, L, R, S, P, Q, G, D, E, r, e, and f be defined as above\") \u2013 but all in all I thought it useful personally to recognise that confronting a subject with a lot of fine detail and \"little pieces\" so to speak was where my weakness lay and I will for sure spend a decent chunk of the summer trying my best to fix that. So yh, on a purely academic standpoint I'm glad I did it.So, a decent class with some ups and downs \u2013 don't romanticise it too much in your head but also don't find this review disheartening especially if you know that the subject is something you have a lot of intrinsic interest for, I'm sure that there will be very many others who felt differently to me. If I were to take this course again I definitely would have read up more on background and motivation (also making sure not to schedule another class during Prof Mazur's office hours would probably have been a good start lmao) and also would have tried to be more present in the course community (had a strange delusion that soloing this course was the way to go; please don't). Definitely did enjoy it overall though and would recommend.",

In the first quarter of the semester, we will hone dramatic techniques through several craft exercise assignments and in-class writing. In the following weeks, students will write two short screenplays. Throughout the semester, we will be workshopping and doing table reads of student work, discussing screenplays and craft texts, and screening a wide array of short films. The emphasis will be on discovering a sense of personal voice and completing two short screenplays (under 20 pages).",

      "A very fun course to take as a senior (or a freshman) that will change the way you engage with film, shows, and even fiction. You learn the basics of screenwriting and how to talk about films. There isn't much scaffolding however, so don't expect this to be a super in\u2013depth class about the practice or filmmaking. It is surface\u2013level, but nonetheless very engaging, fun, and transformative. You will walk away with one 10\u2013page and one 20\u2013page screenplay. It will be a much more fruitful class if you come in with ideas for those already! Overall, the class attracts very hilarious, bright people, and I had a belly laugh every time we met. Musa is an incredible professor as well and a great person to know on campus if you have any interest in move\u2013making.",

I felt like the quizzes threw in some random (or a word you wouldn't commonly use) word from the quizlet and because there's so many words to study, you don't really expect it at least for me.

On the level of the longer passage or indeed the text as a whole, students will be able to (at different points) summarize, describe in detail, and critique the ideas that are being communicated in the text.\u00a0Many lessons will involve students collaborating with their peers.\u00a0No auditors will be permitted.

And most critically: what sorts of sources and interpretive frames might allow us to articulate and understand this variation? Our case studies will draw on a wide range of sources in Japanese cultural history spanning from the late classical period to the digital present. About half of our meetings, however, will be devoted to discussing theoretical writings about the study of place and time. While the greater part of the assigned readings will be in English, participants should also be prepared for some readings in modern Japanese.",

I can't speak for other students who may have grown up with Mandarin Chinese as their first language, but as someone who's a lot more comfortable reading and writing in English than Chinese, this was an enjoyably challenging class to take. Many of the authors that Prof. Wang sets are in the mainstream consciousness, but a good number of them are rather less known, and it's fascinating to see how their fictional worlds diverge from the other fiction that I've read in English for other classes. The material is difficult but very rewarding; Prof. Wang is so knowledgeable (and knows many of these authors personally), handles student questions very elegantly, and he dissects concepts in a way that makes them accessible. If you're confident with your Chinese ability, take this class!",

      "Overall: CS 148/248 is a VLSI design course centered on building a full tape\u2013out of a CMOS camera chip, covering all its components including digital logic, pixel arrays, SRAM memory, pad rings, and wire bonds. A great follow\u2013on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred\u2013slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one\u2019s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year\u2013to\u2013year): MOSFET circuits, RC\u2013timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout\u2013level inverter/nand/nor/half\u2013adder/full\u2013adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically\u2013generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega\u2013OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch\u2013up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in. Additionally, the distinction in expectations need to be made more clear between 148/248.",

    "course_description": "How can we understand the evolution of morality\u2014from primordial soup to superintelligent machines\u2014and how might the science of morality equip us to meet our most pressing moral challenges?In this course we\u2019ll examine the evolution of morality on Earth, from its origins in the biology of unthinking organisms, through the psychology of intelligent primates, and into a future inhabited by machines that may be more intelligent and better organized than humans. First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below\u2014born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the \u201cis\u201d of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental \u201coughts\u201d of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what\u2019s right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth\u2019s evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children? Across diverse topics, this course explores the implications of a single idea: that the wonder we see around us, and ahead of us, is the product of competition and cooperation at increasing levels of complexity.",

This expansive domain integrates computer science, statistics, big data, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. As a transformative technology, AI has achieved remarkable success in understanding natural language and emulating human reasoning, making it invaluable in augmenting human cognition.Despite these advances, many questions remain about the nature of AI and its relationship with human thought. This course invites participants to explore these questions through an intellectual journey. Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI\u2019s power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises.

I found it very cool to learn the science behind how different biomedical imaging modalities we see in the hospitals or in research labs work. I also gained a greater appreciation for the quality of images we can gain from these devices and how quick these images can be obtained.

What makes a novel \u201cpolitical\u201d? Can the novel make a contribution to political theory? How does our understanding of political power change when we imagine detailed and dramatic confrontations between individuals and the state, individuals and empire, or individuals and global ideologies? How does narrative form reinforce or undermine ideology? What archetypal dramas\u2014protest against authority, the loss of political innocence, the battle between tolerance and conviction\u2014have shaped the political novel in its various traditions from the nineteenth century to the present?\u00a0We will consider these questions through some classic and lesser-known political novels from the nineteenth century to the present day, with readings from Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ivan Olbracht, Arthur Koestler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Nadine Gordimer, Milan Kundera, Don Delillo, L\u00e9onora Miano, and others.\u00a0Although we will have occasional short readings in theory, our main focus will be on the attentive reading of complex literature that cannot be reduced to allegories of political conflict or unlocked through primarily \"ideological\" reading.",

We examine the particularities of refugees compared to other migrants, and the changing nature of forced migration since the World Wars. Students explore historical precedents to contemporary forced migration, learn about different host society approaches to asylum, compare government and criminal mechanisms of forced migration, and examine why refugees are objects of suspicion and hostility around the world. Particular attention is paid to the connection between forced confinement and forced migration, the role of refugee camps and urban integration, and alternative strategies for global asylum management by bridge and destination countries.",

      "This is a great course but with reservations. I had super high expectations coming in but some weren't met. Let's start with the pros: Giovanni is truly a great instructor and he is extremely qualified and renowned in his field. The TFs are usually life\u2013savers when it comes to doing the homeworks and the project so please use them as a resource!! You will learn a lot in this course about biostatistics and biomarker research. But! If you expect to come out of it an expert on the topic such that you could confidently and extensively analyze a biomarker dataset without any mistakes or questions, you likely will be mistaken. There are lots of times in class when things went over my head and my biggest qualm is that many important concepts were not mentioned in the notes but only brought up verbally or on the board in class so if you didn't listen/show up that day/take notes, you will not learn them. Or even if you did, you might not remember them later. Especially if you didn't super understand it at that very moment. The bad news is you will not be able to understand every little concept that is brought up on an intuitive level. Some things will go over your head. The good news is you can still do super well (A) in the course even if you don't understand every little concept extremely well.  This doesn't mean you won't learn a lot, you absolutely will, but I am just the kind of person that likes to learn 100% of every concept and never leave a class feeling like there was a concept that I don't intuitively understand. Also some kids will have taken other higher level stat courses like 181 and sometimes, even though they're not required, some concepts from these courses will be brough up and you'll be expected to know them. This is easily resolved with a google search but you should know it going in. Tbh, it's a great choice for people interested in bioinformatics/biostatistics who have taken 110,111, and 139. I just think it's only fair that you know what to expect going in.",

How and why do the racial and gender identities of\u00a0workers affect the economic, social, and emotional value of their labor? How do political and social arrangements of labor help produce and reinforce racial categories while solidifying the boundaries separating masculinity and femininity?

These sometimes hidden histories are key to untangling the gender, sexual, and racial implications of the \u201cintimate industries\u201d that populate today\u2019s transnational labor economies.",

First, we will examine rasa theory as it is spelled out in the Sanskrit N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra, and we will then move on to dhvani or \u201cpoetic resonance\u201d as an analytical category described by the theoreticians \u0100nandavardhana and Abhinavagupta. We will then move on to the themes of land and landscape, which are typical of early Tamil poetry, paying special attention to poetic convention and generic taxonomies. This will give us the means to study poetry produced in India\u2019s classical period. In tandem with our explorations of literary convention, we will read a Sanskrit play, as well as a wide variety of poems from various collections from the Sanskrit and Pr\u0101krit traditions.

Among the questions we will explore: what temporalities are embedded within and rendered problematic by these categories of difference? Can they be usefully deployed in a transhistorical way? If so, how? If not, how else might we get at the issues that these modern concepts raise for historians? The course will be divided into three parts. Part I will focus on theoretical readings. Part II will turn to historiographical case studies, critically evaluating some recent histories in light of these debates. Part III will provide an opportunity for students to bring these questions to bear on their own academic work and fields of study.This is a limited enrollment course.

We hear so much in the media about what causes poverty \u2013 what is reality and what is myth? How do these myths operate to reinforce and sustain economic inequality? Who and what gets left out of the conversation about poverty? Topics in the course include historical understandings of poverty; intergenerational class mobility; depictions of poverty in pop culture; and bringing attention to populations that often get left out of mainstream conversations about poverty.",

This is certainly the case for scholars of United States history. As Western Shoshone scholar Ned Blackhawk has written, \u201cIndigenous absence has long been a tradition of American historical analysis... exiled from the American origin story, Indigenous peoples await the telling of a history that includes them.\u201d With Blackhawk\u2019s words in mind, this course asks an essential question: why do Native people matter to US history? In pursuing an answer to this question, this seminar will focus on aspects of Indigenous sovereignty, race, gender, and environments in the process of U.S. expansion and grapple with the ways in which these struggles over land and sovereignty shaped the United States through the production of its history. Students will engage with the histories of various periods in \u201cNative American history\u201d and historians\u2019 (academic and lay) assessments of them to understand the practice of writing history as itself being a political process, integral to the very phenomenon examined in class. Over the semester, students will utilize museum collections in the Harvard Peabody Museum and Harvard Archives, and explore a range of methods in the discipline of history to grapple with and ultimately re-narrate the Native history of Harvard University.",

    "course_description": "The scientific study of sleep is an area of research that is both highly diverse and among the most interdisciplinary and unifying of topics in psychology and neuroscience. In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives! Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. In this seminar, lectures during the first half of each class will provide overviews of the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep.The second half of each class will be devoted to student-led discussions of assigned study questions as well as free discussions. In a short term paper, students will research in depth a topic of their choice that they find particularly interesting related to sleep neuroscience or mental health.Students will also briefly present what they have learned about their topic during the final class meetings. Some topics students might choose are described in the following paragraph. In addition, students will keep a nightly sleep and/or dream diary for 2-3weeks at some point during the semester in order to learn more about sleep from their own experiences.They will then describe what they have observed in a short essay.In the past, students have found this exercise to be especially interesting. Lastly, there will be a short open-book, unlimited-time final exam on material from the lectures.Topics for term papers might include the characteristic abnormalities of sleep in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive or neurodevelopmental disorders.Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and a contributing cause of mental illnesses. Thus,one might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness,such as the circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness or insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. Still other topics might focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and cognitive performance. For those with more cellular neuroscience interests, topics might focus on linkages between sleep and immunity or the role of sleep in disposal of abnormal proteinsas it relates to neurodegenerative diseases.",

What forms of medicine are okay? Should treatment be mediated by a Brain\u2013Computer interface? The class also has such a great energy. It's interactive but not in an awkward way and Dr. Silbersweig does a great job at encouraging discussion. The weekly assignments are just summaries of the two of the readings in a meaninful way, and a greater question that the readings made us think about; they were pretty easy, except some weeks the readings were long. Dr. Silberweig was understanding, though, if we couldn't write about all the readings. The final assignment is a 10 page research paper.",

These included medical crimes, which, thus far, are the most thoroughly documented examples of ethical transgressions of health care professionals. They include forced sterilizations, the \u201ceuthanasia\u201d systematic patient murder program, and forced brutal medical experiments on the living and the dead. However, under conditions of oppression by the same political system, some health care professionals chose to retain the healing powers of medicine.Anatomy in Nazi Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the medical sciences that reveals the complex relationships between scientists and the Nazi regime. Changes of the traditional anatomical body procurement manifested in the use of many bodies of Nazi victims in teaching and scientific investigations. Research gradually moved from routine studies to murder, from the anatomy lab to the Nazi prison system and then to the concentration camps. Ultimately, anatomists were complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived \u201cenemies\u201d of the Nazi regime.This history of medicine can thus serve as a model for the recognition of patterns and common roots with other histories of discrimination, oppression, and atrocities. Also, there are continuities and legacies from this history that reach into the present and have relevance for today\u2019s education and practice in the health professions.",

      "CS 205 is a great class with the potential to be even better. The content is comprehensive and well\u2013structured, covering a wide range of topics. However, some students who hadn't taken related courses beforehand found the pace to be quite rapid and the material challenging to grasp. In my case, having prior knowledge from courses like CS 61, CS 165, CS 265, CS 141, and CS 246 was incredibly helpful in understanding and connecting the concepts taught in this class.The teaching quality is satisfactory, with lecture presentations being a particularly useful resource for reviewing material, even if you cannot attend the lectures in person.The workload is generally manageable, but there is room for improvement in the scheduling of assignments. Having the last homework, final presentation, and final paper due within a short span during the reading period can be overwhelming. Adjusting these deadlines in future iterations of the course would greatly benefit students.Regarding grading and quizzes, there seems to be an emphasis on deducting points rather than providing constructive feedback. Some quiz questions, especially in the beginning, felt like they were designed to trick students rather than assess their understanding of the content. However, the quizzes did improve over time, focusing more on knowledge checks.The lab sessions, while helpful for projects and homework, have a mandatory attendance policy that feels unnecessary. Some students only attend to get the attendance link and then leave, as there is no substantial value in staying. Losing points for forgetting to attend a lab seems unfair, given the limited benefit of being present.Overall, CS 205 is a valuable class that can teach you a great deal, particularly if you have some background in the covered concepts. However, there is definitely room for improvement in terms of logistics and the grading approach. Making lab attendance optional or ensuring that it provides meaningful value would also enhance the course. Despite these issues, I highly  recommend taking this class.",

The course will include the exploration of both literary and non-literary genres and authentic texts (films, novels, newspaper articles, podcasts, etc.) that will help students perfect their personal style in Italian. Students will investigate themes such as LGBTQ+ activism and civil right movements in Italy, prison education, sexism and gender in Italian literature, culture, and society, among others, by analyzing a wide range of authentic texts, films, documents, and materials. By the end of the course, students will be able to: recognize and produce different genres of written and spoken Italian; identify features of language including differences in register; and write more confidently in academic Italian.\u00a0Students will enhance their writing proficiency and develop their academic language by practicing different types of creative and analytical writing assignments (movie and book reviews, social media posts, subjective and objective descriptions, argumentative essays, among others).",

The problem sets are all formal proofs (no coding), and the second half of the semester is reading papers in control theory (not control applications). You can do an implementation project at the end of the course, but for anyone really interested in engineering solutions for control, you might be better off in a different class.For coursework, the class is split into two parts. For the first half of the semester, there is a PSet due every two weeks. Read the book religiously\u2013\u2013\u2013the lectures were copied straight from the book, and it was extremely helpful for problem sets. The problems aren't too bad if you give yourself enough time. Once problem sets stop and reading reflections begin, expect to spend a lot of time reading papers on linear control theory bounds and scratching your head wondering how useful the stuff really is. I thought it got better at the very end when we started looking at MPC and RL, and that stuff is really useful!",

I really enjoyed taking this class with my fellow undergrads because subir was so memeable that this course became very fun even though the psets were not fun at all. the material was very important to know for condensed matter, but there is an implicit requiremnt that you already know quantum field theory before taking this class. Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things.",

It is HARD and there is an immense amount of reading \u2013 to be successful in this class you NEED to stay on top of the readings as it's literally impossible to catch up after that. The grading is a bit harsh and somewhat unpredictable though still fair. If you're looking for a gem, this is not it, and if you're trying to preserve a 4.0/desperately want a high GPA this course might not be the one to take. THAT SAID this class genuinely changed my entire perspective relating to democracy and Latin America and I loved every minute of Professor Levitsky's lectures, which were SO invigorating and he was obviously so passionate about the material. The TFs in this course are the best TFs I've experienced while at Harvard. This class made me love government and poli sci and honestly has even affected my ideas for my future career paths to be more oriented in this direction. Genuinely I never write this much about any class, but if you're interested at all in Latin America or comparative gov, TAKE THIS CLASS. TL;DR: Not a gem or easy class at all but if you want to genuinely learn and be changed and inspired, take this class. Be prepared to not get an A or at least to not be able to depend on an A, but truly (as cliche and cheesy as this sounds) what you take from this class is honestly worth it beyond grades.",

      "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! No matter what your concentration is, you won't regret taking CS32 because in our world where everything is becoming more and more digitalized, having some experience in coding (Python is the language used in CS32) with whatever you do is super beneficial. The concepts from class are so cool and interesting and the homework never feels like busy work because they actually push you to utilize your knowledge to solve the challenge at hand. The course really tries to help students manage stress while doing CS during a busy semester. All the PSETs come with a week of extension time in case you need it. As long as you are not abusing the system (like you actually needed time to figure everything out as a beginner), you'll be fine! The PSETs also offer a safe space for learning because four of the five PSETs don't expect you to be perfect to get a good score. Instead, they just want to see serious effort, logical thinking, and decent usage of knowledge from class. If you put in serious effort, the final code and grade will honestly take care of themselves. The small quizzes throughout the semester are also low stakes (four to five points each) and their main purpose is to act as checkpoints for your understanding. They are meant to be straightforward and beneficial than anything else, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. Ask questions if you find yourself confused at any point. There will be a mix of emotions ranging from determination to frustration to ecstasy, but at the end of the roller coaster, you will walk away feeling proud and satisfied of how much you grew and were able to accomplish. Definitely spread your time out in completing the PSETs because scrambling to finish the code all at once isn't going to cut it. Besides, you will get so much more out of the class if your understanding/epiphany moments are gradual. Definitely go to office hours. Everyone in the staff team is so helpful and kind. And make some friends in CS32! They will make your experience that much better and the memories I got from this course are ones that I love looking back on.",

      "One of the best courses I have ever taken! ~ course material ~The class was a very well\u2013taught introduction to probability theory and a glimpse of some cool ideas beyond. It begins with some basic concepts from stat 210 with some more rigor (e.g., review of conditional expectation and convergence theorems); then, one discusses the Martingale Convergence theorem, uniform integrability, and convergence in L^p spaces. The classic 0\u20131 laws are discussed, with applications, e.g. in LLN or U\u2013statistics; exchangeability is introduced. Some concentration inequalities (azuma, efron\u2013stein) are proven. The first half of the course then ends with the martingale CLT, which is quite a cool result! The second half then begins with a discussion of Brownian Motion (intro, construction, uniqueness, properties), etc. One then moves to Stein's method. Finally, there is a final project, in which one reads a paper (typically somewhat recent research output), and gives a presentation. Overall, the material is quite fun, and there are a lot of cool theorems and proof methods!~ comments ~The course is organized in a very good manner, as to provide both fundamentals and a bit of an idea of the field. Most courses tend to do only one of the two (or neither). However, the basic material (first half and BM) are done fairly rigorously; occasionally measure theory is swept under the rug, but it can be justified with some (and not too great) effort. The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course\u2013time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters\u2013Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly 'Fundamentals on Stein's Method' (cf. arxiv) provides rigor for the Stein's method parts. I find that the very important fundamentals are done quite rigorously and well; some results are introduced to give a sense of what types of results have been proven, and this latter type is usually not justified, but rather intuition (which is good) is provided. The lecturing is fantastic. The usual way I like lectures to go is to either (1) explicate the material in a clear and engaging manner or (2) provide some intuition otherwise not found. These are both done; the first half of the course especially, Morgane encourages participation and engagement by asking questions about how to proceed; following closely in the course was helpful both in understanding the proofs better and being able to come up with and understand the main techniques of proof (e.g., 'definitions!'). Lecturing speed varies; I found that it started quite quickly and then in the end slowed down a bit. As noted in the last paragraph, I think intuition for the unproven results provided was very useful, whereas the basic facts were justified rigorously (and for these, the intuition often comes from going through the basic ideas and really thinking about the math over and over again). The assignments are fairly chill and fun. There are about 5 HW assignments, with one drop; there are a large number of additional problems and HWs which are very useful when studying the exam or for gaining more familiarity with the concepts (so one has enough problems to work with, but there is minimal stress). The final project was a fun way to see what sort of methods and ideas are being researched in probability (e.g., random matrix theory, Stein's method, etc.). Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to comprehend the presentations, but I enjoyed it because one gains a viewpoint of how the course can lead to later research. Now, a few miscellaneous comments \u2014 the exams are not easy, but contain many fun problems. Studying is certainly necessary but the review process is helpful in going through the main ideas of the course, and there are a number of problems and past finals which are enjoyable (there are a lot of 'cute' problems). I would advise one to read the reference materials, both for review purposes, and because they are good classics, which provide a lot of extras (concepts or 'measure theory' etc!) Lastly, Morgane is very approachable outside of class; I went to a few office hours to ask questions, in addition to our final project meeting. She provides helpful wisdom, both in respect to the main concepts of the course as well as life advice, e.g. experiences in grad school, which I appreciate. I came into this semester with a heavy math background and stat 210 deciding that I wanted a change from heavily abstract mathematics to learn more stats \u2014 this course has genuinely built my enjoyment and interest in probability and was important in helping me settle my focus in the field; in this way it has been a very important course for my personal path. It also has provided a satisfyingly large collection of resources for further exploration (e.g., there are the three course references mentioned; a collection of papers from final projects, resources for random matrix theory, etc.). If you are considering this course, definitely take it!",

There is no particular reason to think that a market economy will yield an equitable distribution of income, and given this what is the appropriate government response?

We will explore, manipulate, subvert, or find alternative uses for these often overlooked drawing conventions. A new drawing vocabulary will emerge from our research and practice.Through the use of these new drawing vocabularies we will develop our own systems of visual communication and conceptual experimentation. The result will be the creation of experimental bodies of knowledge and new forms of thought - essentially developing an archive based on individual interests and goals. These archives can be subversive, interrogative, playful or serious. Along with projects and assignments we will delve into a long tradition of artists who have undermined established systems of knowledge, taste, and hierarchy by rethinking and sometimes fictionalizing their archives.",

The focus will be on changing and developing kabbalistic systems, questions of messianism and redemption, history, heresy, and the impact of modernity and postmodernity on kabbalistic praxis. Larger questions on mystical religion, law, secularism, and the differences between normative religion and spirituality will also be discussed.",

To that end, in this course, you will use the tools and stylistic elements of creative nonfiction, namely fragmentation, narrative, scene, point of view, speculation, and research to remix and retell all aspects of your experience and selfhood in a multiplicity of ways.

For chemistry and engineering students, we hope this class can teach you solid state theory without being bogged down by heavy math.

      "CHEM 166 was a new course offered in Spring 2024 taught by Professor Suyang Xu. As a whole, CHEM 166 was definitely an interesting introduction to various aspects of quantum chemistry and physics, especially as it relates to topics like superconductors, topological insulators, magnets, and more. Professor Xu is a very talented instructor that has a clear passion for the field, and is also generous enough to provide Papa John\u2019s pizza once/week for students! (a clear highlight throughout the semester)Within the CHEM department, CHEM 166 is definitely a relatively gemmy course when it comes to workload and time commitment. Outside of the twice/week lectures and once/week section (which only starts after spring break), there are no Problem Sets or Exams. Instead, the class is structured around a group project where groups of 3\u20134 present on primary literature related one of the topics taught about in class, and subsequently turn in a two\u2013page paper reflecting on said topic. Following this, instead of a Final Exam, the class has instead opted for a Final Project, which is a simple one\u2013page paper using DFT to calculate the band structure of a material. Overall, it is obvious that the focus of the class lies in learning about the content and truly enjoying the material. In my opinion, the only downside is that the concepts can occasionally be harder to digest for students without as strong of a background in chemistry and/or physics, as a lot of lectures relate back to deriving formulas and theories. Overall, the only downside to this course relates back to the fact that no grades are provided for the group presentation, and that the group paper and final project are not due until the end of exam period. As a result, it is hard to gauge where you stand in the class, especially when it comes to deciding final letter grades since there are no assigned cutoffs. However, CHEM 166 remains an outstanding course overall.As a whole, CHEM 166 is definitely a great class and is one worth time and consideration for any aspiring CHEM concentrators!",

To better understand the role(s) that public education play[ed] in these movements, we will read books and articles, listen to and watch media, study social media, adventure to communities (virtually and in person!) and meet activists. In addition, seminar assignments will allow students to delve more deeply into the role of education in a social movement of their choice. These assignments are intended to help seminar students improve research, writing, networking, and presentation skills.",

      "Take this class! Nicole is so wonderful and does her best to set you up well for your first semester of college by introducing you to resources you may not have known about (such as the Learning Lab) and facilitating connections between you and your classmates. The class covers three movements (desegregation, DREAMers, and gun violence prevention), and features several activist/historian guest speakers as well as a field trip to East Boston High School. While the readings are definitely comprehensive, Nicole tries to format them in a way where you can listen/read while doing other things, so it doesn't feel like as much work. It is clear how much she cares about us as people and wants to make sure we are successful. The class is super discussion\u2013based and I got to know and love everyone else in our section.

The unit reflections are not a big lift at all, but I found it really really helpful to go to office hours and talk through ideas and analysis.

    "course_description": "Propaganda is a persuasive tool that has been used for centuries, but the continued development of communication technologies has exposed us to more of it than ever before. Propaganda is disseminated through forms of mass and social media, and it is used in political campaigns, during wartime, in advertising, art, film, music, journalism, and even in education. However, just because propagandists attempt to persuade you doesn\u2019t mean that it will work every time. A variety of factors, particularly other people in our social networks, can prime us for manipulation, but they can also protect us from being manipulated. The intimate connections we maintain with others and the kind of circles we run in may even predict which types of propaganda we will believe and why.\u00a0In this class, we will take a sociological perspective to the study of propaganda and persuasion in media. This means that we will analyze uses of propaganda in the context of social conditions rather than focus on purely psychological factors that may lead to persuasion (though we\u2019ll look at those, too). You will learn about what propaganda is and its connection to communication technologies, techniques that propagandists have used to persuade the public, and you will even dabble in the dark arts of propaganda creation. While this class includes some important theoretical elements, we will ground the theoretical in the practical by analyzing real propaganda campaigns from the 20th and 21st centuries.",

How do economic theory and econometrics illuminate, and obfuscate, the challenges of mental illness? Mental health has quickly become one of the most important topics in global policymaking. Yet the links between influential fields of social science \u2013 especially economics \u2013 and behavioral medicine remain underdeveloped.\u00a0 This course will first explore the frontier of concepts in psychopathology, including perspectives from rational choice theory which are both limiting and illuminating in the ongoing quest to characterize mental health and mental illness.\u00a0 The course will then turn to the social and economic drivers of mental health.\u00a0 From deaths of despair\u00a0and the U.S. opioid epidemic, conspicuous consumption and income-wellbeing relationship, social media and American teen distress, and our general state of misery despite unprecedented material affluence, this course will systematically investigate the influences of society on mental health. Unlike most courses on mental health in other departments or medical schools, the syllabus will uncover unique empirical insights produced by the field of economics, and review in detail the econometric techniques used in these studies. Third, we will turn to the influences of mental health on society. We will consider extreme outcomes in housing markets such as homelessness and its relationship to severe mental illness. We examine classical approaches in economics to the housing market and homelessness, including new insights from behavioral health and transnational perspectives. Finally, we will turn to the roll of interventions.\u00a0 From pharmacotherapy, new interventional techniques (ECT, rTMS, ketamine), therapy, nutrition, and health system organization, ACT teams, supportive housing, we will consider potential and limitations in current societal responses to mental illness, using cross-national comparisons to illuminate the important differences in outcomes.\u00a0 We end with a consideration of the goals of economic policy, and examine how a focus on enhancing human mental wellbeing may offer unique opportunities in climate change and growth policy.",

Basic techniques will be introduced from selected performance traditions from Sanskrit, Kabuki, Kathakali theater traditions to Butoh dance, Grotowski's movement lab, Scott Graham\u2019s \u201cFrantic Method\u201d and Joshua Fried's headphone work. We will discuss how material may be generated through these performance methods (and will engage parallel discussion about the ethics of using quoted movement from cultural ritual and performance traditions).We will both investigate and physicalize the practices and methods of devised theater from the early 20th century to present (with a particular focus on the Dada and Futurist movements of 1910\u2019s-20\u2019s, as well as on the methods of Bertolt Brecht). Short Futurist and Dadaist scripts will be analyzed and performed as spoken text becomes more prevalent in composing classwork.

We will also briefly explore Rasa Boxes as an improvisational tool.Daily class time will often involve some sort of performance or improvisation by individuals or assigned small groups, culminating in final performance projects at the end of the semester. \u00a0Along the way, we will continue practice of simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument.\u00a0The class will be both rigorously physical and dialogic...and often fun!",

How much can a person own a text, or a character? How far can an adaptation go before audiences no longer recognize, or reject, an adaptation? What economic and cultural roles do adaptations play in our contemporary media landscape?

This course\u00a0explores the dynamics of coloniality in Latin America through the lens of musical and aural practices that, regulated by a variety of imperial, religious, and civic institutions, played a significant role in shaping the ideologies that have affected everyday class, racial, and gender relations in the region for centuries. The class studies the uses of Catholic music (cathedral and convent), secular music (villancicos and theatrical forms), and folk music (son traditions, fandangos, and Afro Latin American traditions) and their intersections in the implementation and negotiation of colonial class and racial structures and everyday practices, as well as in the development of new transgressive hybrid forms and spaces. These were transcultural forms that allowed members of subaltern racial and ethnic groups to forge cultural spaces of resistance and collective expression within the highly hierarchical order of the colonial Spanish viceroyalties and the Portuguese captaincies of Brazil.",

It was originally used to write the Sumerian language, a language that continued to be written for over 3 millennia and produced a corpus of well over 100,000 preserved texts. The act of writing\u2014a means of externalizing and visually representing language\u2014has an inherent materiality to it, one that was new and innovative in the ancient world. In this class, we will explore the relationship between the Sumerian language and the materiality of its writing. Topics will include:How did the cuneiform script develop from visual depictions of material objects to abstract, polysemous signs?\u00a0How were clay tablets made? How were they prepared for writing? What was the process of inscribing Sumerian on other materials?\u00a0How did formatting of the tablet develop to provide additional information beyond the text itself? How was text used in conjunction with other types of visual representation (e.g., maps, sketches, floor plans)?What roles did Sumerian inscriptions play on monumental works of art? What do self-referential inscriptions tell us about the objects on which they were inscribed?What functions could Sumerian writing serve beyond conveying linguistic content?A second major component of the course will focus on the materiality of texts as objects preserved in a museum collection. The class will meet in the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East and will make extensive use of its cuneiform tablet collection.",

Case studies focused on various groups of Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for discussion of many different aspects of Mesopotamian religious life.The civilization of Sumer is the oldest civilization in recorded history; the first texts known to humankind were written in Sumer over 5,000 years ago. From the start of writing, and continuing over next three millennia, Sumerian texts offer a multifaceted wealth of insight into religious practices and beliefs of the ancient world. From these texts, we learn about ancient conceptions of creation, the universe, and humanity; myths about gods, goddesses, and demons; the performance of rituals and cultic rites; the construction and provisioning of cult statues; the day-to-day functioning of ancient temples; and much more. Elements of Sumerian religion can be traced through subsequent and surrounding cultures and traditions, both in Assyria and Babylonia, and further afield in the Hittite, Israelite, and Greco-Roman worlds. The study of ancient religions is not only integral to understanding these societies and civilizations to which they belonged, but it also serves as an invaluable point of reference for reflecting on modern-day religions and worldviews.Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for exploring all the topics mentioned above. Primary texts will be provided in transliteration and translation; students will read the texts in translation while making frequent reference to the original Sumerian.

What unique challenges do trans and gender-diverse youth face in seeking medical care as a result of recent transphobic laws and policies? How are community organizers advocating for the end of medical neglect, abuse, and torture in prisons and migrant detention facilities? In this largely discussion-based course we explore these questions and many others. Social approaches to medicine and public health challenge and expand contemporary debates in the medical humanities by centering issues of gender, race, and sexuality. This course provides an overview of the theoretical landscape and social movements that ground recent developments in the field. In particular, the course engages feminist theory, disability justice movements, critical race theory, queer theory, anti-colonial thought, and trans liberation movements. Special attention is paid to the structuring force of anti-Blackness in various clinical and research settings, the development and racialization of transgender medicine, and what it means to view state violence as an issue in public health and the medical humanities.",

This course will delve into the state-of-the-art research\u00a0in both basic and clinical auditory neuroscience. Students will learn about brain plasticity associated with musical training and the therapeutic potential of music in clinical contexts, ranging from neurodevelopmental to neurodegenerative conditions. The course will be interdisciplinary, blending research from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and medicine. The class will also take a trip to Dr. Arnett\u2019s laboratory at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to see a demonstration of how electroencephalography (EEG) is used to measure brain activity during auditory-perceptual paradigms in children. By the end of the course, students will have developed critical thinking skills and the ability to evaluate scientific findings related to the therapeutic applications of music. They will gain a deeper understanding of experimental methods and the contentious theoretical issues and debates in music neuroscience and therapy. These topics will be explored through a mix of student- and faculty-led presentations, written critiques, and class discussions.",

The solid phase will generally have a crystalline structure (liquid is amorphous or has no long-range order).\u00a0 It can be an insulator, semiconductor, or metal; it can be magnetic or non-magnetic. In this seminar we shall discuss a number of remarkable phases of matter. Below a certain temperature a metal can become superconducting, flow of electrical current without resistance; helium liquifies and at lower temperature becomes a superfluid, fluid flow without dissipation. As temperature is lowered, magnetic moments on atoms in a solid align and one observes a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phase. Not all materials have a solid phase: helium remains a liquid as temperature approaches absolute zero. But, applying pressure causes liquid helium to solidify.\u00a0 We shall discuss not only the materials but the techniques to create high and low temperature, high pressure, and high magnetic fields that affect the phases of matter and how they are studied. We will not carry out rigorous arguments for the behavior of matter, but rather rely on so-called \u201chand-waving\u201d arguments.",

It will address questions like the following:Does the existence of widespread ethical disagreement mean that there can\u2019t be any objective facts and it\u2019s all just a matter of opinion? Can we reconcile the idea of an objective ethical reality with evolutionary and sociological arguments that explain how we developed our beliefs? Is it strange that there can be facts that tell you what to do?We will begin by examining three famous arguments for an \u201canti-realist\u201d metaethics: J.L. Mackie\u2019s arguments from disagreement and from \u201cqueerness\u201d, and Sharon Street\u2019s \u201cDarwinian dilemma\u201d. All three arguments challenge the idea that our ethical beliefs reflect some kind of mind-independent facts. We will begin to develop philosophical skills through close analysis of these arguments, identifying their logical structure and the places where they could be challenged. We will then apply these skills to a series of texts defending alternative metaethical views, including reductive and non-reductive naturalism, quasi-realism, and constructivism. We will explore those four positions and the main challenges for each of them. Throughout, we will ask whether our ethical beliefs are on surer footing than some other kinds of normative beliefs, especially beliefs about aesthetics, beliefs about rationality, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 beliefs about what we should believe.",

The concepts taught result from decades of scientific research. Research is a process of inquiry that seeks knowledge about important problems that are not understood. Experiencing the intellectual excitement and challenges of performing research can support your long-term career goals regardless of what those are, but how does someone go about creating new knowledge through research?Lab courses teach the mechanics of performing specific techniques, keeping a notebook, and interpreting data, yet they rarely address how new knowledge is generated. How does a scientist know what questions to ask? What makes a question worth spending time and resources on? How do scientists come up with strategies to address these impactful questions? All scientists start by critically evaluating a field, but what does that mean? How do you read a scientific article and analyze their methods and conclusions? How can primary literature effectively help frame the questions in need of answers? This seminar guides students into the world of scientific research and prepares them for a real-world research experience.

This course is designed to give students an overall good grasp of the history of the modern Middle East and of some of the major themes in modern Middle Eastern Studies. Students will critically engage with some of the most important topics that resonate in that area of the world. We will cover topics such as reformism, economic development, colonialism and nationalism, authoritarianism and democratization, sectarianism, culture, gender, literature and the arts, as well as the role of religion in politics. Most of these topics, in one way or another, will speak to the construction of nation-states in the Middle East and to the challenges they have been confronting. This is not a survey course. In particular, it will not be exhaustive in its coverage of the region in space or time, and in its coverage of topics. Students in search of a specific topic, country, or period are strongly encouraged to take a look at the syllabus prior to enrolling to make sure their specific interests will be covered. Assigned readings will consist of primary and secondary sources. Students will be exposed to first-hand accounts by protagonists in the history of the Middle East (primary sources) as well as to the diversity of approaches that the scholarly literature (secondary sources) has taken across disciplines, e.g. anthropological studies, quantitative analysis, philology and textual studies.

The lectures are fantastic; Quinn is incredibly engaging, and I never felt so comfortable or eager participating in class sessions. The readings are so stimulating, and give a great sense of different perspectives in western ethics, articulated convincingly.

    "course_description": "This course provides students with an understanding of the complexities surrounding today\u2019s most intractable problems and helps them develop methodologies for navigating the challenges they will face. After introducing systems thinking, with a focus on interconnections and feedback loops, the course will address a significant interdisciplinary issue: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relationship to human cognition.\u00a0The study of AI and human cognition is both timely and dynamic. This expansive domain integrates computer science, statistics, big data, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. As a transformative technology, AI has achieved remarkable success in understanding natural language and emulating human reasoning, making it invaluable in augmenting human cognition.Despite these advances, many questions remain about the nature of AI and its relationship with human thought. This course invites participants to explore these questions through an intellectual journey. Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI\u2019s power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises. Additionally, students will experience the value of collaboration and the importance of diversity while working in diverse teams.",

Africa is a continent rich in landscape projects and practices but only eight out of fifty-four African nations have professional associations of landscape architects. The course is framed around three central questions: 1.) How is landscape architecture currently practiced in African countries? (2.) What lessons can we learn from landscape practices in various African societies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and social inequities? (3.) As landscape architecture unfolds across the continent in the next 50\u2013200 years, how can it continue assert its agency in the fight against changing climates and social inequity and claim a central space in the shaping of African cities of the future? Each week we will focus on a different country including South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. In collaboration with several landscape architecture university programs across Africa and including practitioners and academics from across the continent, this seminar will explore what it means to practice and teach landscape architecture in societies in which the profession is nascent or non-existent and speculate on the future of the shaping of landscapes in the Global South.",

The course is a journey through vibrant historical hubs, each connected in a complex web of trade, culture, and politics. From Byzantine Constantinople, Europe's cultural and commercial powerhouse, to the kingdom of Aksum, East Africa's crossroads of trade and religions, and from the splendor of Venice to Hangzhou, one of ancient China's capitals, as we trace Marco Polo's footsteps. Delving into the rise and fall of empires and kingdoms, we will investigate conflicts, journeys of exploration, economic and scientific developments, and a rich tapestry of art and material culture.At the core of The King's Money is the study of medieval currencies\u2014the most widely circulated art form extending from Britain to the Indian Ocean. The course highlights how coins, seals, and medals served as vital symbols of political authority, artistic innovation, cultural identity, and economic exchange. By examining how disparate communities separated by language, religion, political systems, and swathes of land and sea interacted through currencies, we will gain insight into the profound connections money forges along routes of trade, warfare, pilgrimage, and diplomacy.\u00a0The course also examines\u00a0the\u00a0lasting impact of medieval\u00a0currencies\u00a0on 21st-century economics, art and literature, politics, and national narratives, as well as their significance in museum collections and\u00a0the\u00a0digital landscape, emphasizing their relevance to our modern world",

European empires in Africa sought to impose their ideas of \"civilization\" and \"modernity\" on Africans through organized athletics, and yet Africans themselves - both during and after the period of European rule - used athletics for their own purposes. Notable athletes played a key role in both combating and supporting colonialism, and in establishing national identities following independence. In recent decades, Africans have starred globally at the Olympic Games, the World Cup, and many other global athletic competitions. And increasingly, individuals from more recent African diasporas have starred for countries around the globe, raising important questions about belonging, diaspora, and nationalism. This course will provide an introduction to these questions and more, through understanding the social, political, cultural, and economic history of sports in Africa.",

It looks at a period of particular global conflict over memory, when after the end of World War II, the world moves into the decades of the Cold War. We ask how literature participates in the construction of memory and how it sheds light on different sorts of vulnerability and abuses of memory. In what different roles does literature put us as readers in order to compel us to keep memory alive, participate in its construction, or be tempted into forgetfulness? Through literary and theoretical texts, we will discuss the role of literature in narrating tragic and overwhelming experiences, which hardly find their place in language. We will look at the ways in which past and its evocation can be\u2013\u2013deliberately or not\u2013\u2013distorted, censored, and used for political aims.

They will make a pitch to serve as your academic mentor, and together, you'll plan an undergraduate curriculum focused on building the skills and knowledge you'd need to tackle your chosen GHP. You'll also study historical cases where seemingly impossible problems were solved, often by young researchers with fresh perspectives.By the end of the seminar, you'll have a clearer picture of the scientific landscape and where you might fit into it.

If humans were all the same, free of identity, ideology, or culture, then many social scourges\u2014prejudice, discrimination, perhaps even some violent conflict\u2014would be dramatically reduced, if not eliminated. But with diversity also comes the wonderful variation that allows for the forces of evolution and innovation to better societies. In response to this tension, humans have created institutions to manage diversity by regulating conflict and reconciling differences of opinion. Politics is the process of navigating these difference managing institutions. The problem of politics then is the problem of diversity.Drawing on the disciplines of political science, psychology, economics, and philosophy, this course examines the question of how diverse societies and institutions can be successful. The course ultimately aims to provide students with the tools to be informed citizens and leaders in a diverse society.In the first part of the course, we start with the psychology of division, examining the basic question of why there is variation between humans and why this variation affects our social behavior. We then examine the consequences of diversity. Why does diversity make the necessary elements of society, such as coordination, difficult?In the second part of the course, we will draw primarily on philosophy to ask if diversity is a desirable state for societies and institutions or if societies should rather seek homogeneity.Having considered these questions, in the third part of the course we examine how political institutions manage diversity by employing different strategies, sometimes strategies of division and sometimes strategies of creating unity. Drawing on classic works of political theory and contemporary political science, we will examine institutions, including ethnonationalist and multicultural states, constitutions, and other institutions that are created to successfully manage diversity.Finally, in the fourth part of the course, we will examine the public policy of managing diversity. How do societies choose to manage public spaces, restrict flows of immigration, and create institutions, such as schools, to reconcile a diversity\u00a0of interests.",

    "course_description": "The Edo period witnessed the rise of two major theatrical forms\u2014j\u014druri (puppet theater) and kabuki\u2014that would exert an enormous impact on early modern culture. Both remain living performance genres today. Yet studying them as forms of early modern theater proves daunting. Both forms have undergone significant changes since the end of the Edo period (as, indeed, they transformed across the centuries of Tokugawa rule). And because performance is, by nature, ephemeral, reconstructing the dynamics and experience of an early modern play presents significant challenges. This is particularly true in the case of kabuki: a form for which the script (few of which survive) served primarily as a general outline for performances that could change significantly from one showing to the next. Yet both theaters left a wide range of traces in diverse media: playbills, actor critiques, actor and theater prints, objects, book illustrations, and theater-related books of all varieties, from satirical \u201caudience critiques\u201d to adaptations of plays into illustrated print fiction (kusaz\u014dshi).\u00a0This seminar has three aims. First, it will introduce students to practical methods for studying early modern performance: familiarizing them with archives of theatrical ephemera, introducing strategies for accessing elements of performance from secondary materials, studying accounts of playwriting and performance by early modern playwrights and actors, and weighing the pitfalls and rewards of relying upon the conventions of modern performances. Second, it will invite students to understand early modern \u201ctheater\u201d not only as a matter of performance, but as a broader cultural phenomenon that most people accessed not within the playhouse, but through secondary media like playbills, prints, critiques, merchandise, and fiction. And third, the seminar will delve into broader cultural, social, and political dimensions of theater in the early modern period, touching on such subjects as the relationship between the theater and the sacred; the theater\u2019s relationship to early modern discourses of emotion; the body of the actor and the performance of gender; fan culture; the relationship between urban and rural theatrical culture; and the ongoing debate about whether early modern kabuki is better understood as a subversive or a conservative genre. Our learning will take place not only in the classroom, but also through visits to the Harvard Art Museums and the Yenching Rare Book Room.",

Students will take turns leading class discussions each week. Over the semester, students will also develop a research paper, submitting a research question by Week 4, a literature review by Week 7, and an analysis section by Week 10. In the last week of classes, final papers will be submitted, and students will read and provide feedback on each other\u2019s work, encouraging constructive critique.",

    "course_description": "Some kids break the rules. Others don\u2019t seem to care they exist. Why do some grow into empathetic, socially responsible adults while others develop traits like manipulation, fearlessness, and a lack of remorse? This seminar dives into one of the most unsettling questions in developmental psychology: How do early social experiences shape the trajectory toward psychopathy? Students will explore how risk factors such as insecure attachment, harsh parenting, and deviant peer influences contribute to the development of callous-unemotional (CU) traits and severe antisocial behavior. Through a blend of case studies, cutting-edge research, and seminar-style discussions, we\u2019ll examine how children with CU traits regulate emotions, navigate peer relationships, and respond (or fail to respond) to traditional interventions. We\u2019ll critically evaluate why common treatment approaches often fall short and investigate emerging interventions designed to improve emotion regulation and reduce aggression. This course challenges students to engage with complex issues, explore innovative solutions, and consider how the field of developmental psychology can evolve to better address these difficult behaviors.",

Through a series of case studies, the course explores art historical issues for which the folding screen provides a unique perspective, including the relationships between painting and architectural space, poetic practice, and religious ritual.\u00a0\u00a0Functioning simultaneously as furniture and pictorial surface, spatial divide and architectural decor, the folding screen has played an important role in shaping culture and lived experience in the Japanese archipelago for over a millennium.\u00a0 Transportable and displayable in a variety of ways, the folding screen can surround a space and immediately charge it with meaning. Some of the most historically significant Japanese paintings were executed in this format, and its influence around the world can be seen in everything from the painted panels of James McNeil Whistler to the biombo of colonial Latin America. This graduate lecture surveys the history and development of the Japanese folding screen from the 8th to the 20th centuries.\u00a0Each week will focus on one case study from the screen painting tradition to highlight a historical theme and methodological problem closely linked to the unique properties of this format. These themes offer a range of issues crucial to the reconceptualization of Japanese painting history as a whole: 1) The function of screens in different social spaces (the Nara Imperial Palace, the Heian aristocratic compound, the Buddhist temple hall, the Ashikaga shogunal residence; or the modern reception room); 2) the various text-image relationships embodied by different types of screens (including both the relationship of painting to poetic practice and the pictorialization of narrative texts); 3) the role of screens in religious ritual, including the Esoteric initiation (abisekha) ceremony and mortuary practice; 4) compositional strategies reflected in the adaptations of painting subjects in other formats to the folding-screen surface; 5) the function of screens as representations of different types of topoi, charged with a panoply of political and cultural meanings; and 6) the interpretation of depictions of screens within other paintings.",

Readings include writing by Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Samper; political and social theory by Charles Mills, Sylvia Wynter, Eduardo Galeano, and Antonio Ben\u00edtez Rojo; and literature by Amitav Ghosh, Jean Rhys, and Miriam Warner-Vieyra.

Psychological research sometimes creates fiction to test scientific hypotheses, and, if all goes well, it too reveals deep truths about human nature. In this course, we will use literature and film to introduce topics on the science of social relationships, including how humans think about love, status, power, and social bonds. We will read two contemporary books, Still Life by Sarah Winman and Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. These books will be supplemented by films. Both books span several decades and are, most simply, stories about human relationships over time. Still Life explores the psychology of love across different types of relationships: family, friendship and romantic relationships. Pachinko explores how relationships are changed in societies with racial prejudice. They are both rich with hypotheses about the psychology of social relationships. In addition to reading fiction you will get practice on how to read, dissect, and critique scientific papers on these topics. You will get hands-on experience with designing scientific studies to answer questions about the psychology of social relationships. The final project will be to use hypotheses from the books or films in the course to design an original experiment that investigates the cognition of relationships.",

Understanding the social side of climate change means shifting our attention from particles to people. We address such questions as: What is it about modern social life that has caused climate change? Why have societies responded so slowly to the climate crisis? What do social movements for environmental justice and climate justice contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation? How can people use social processes and organizations to adapt to life on a changing planet? Along the way, we explore new research on surprising aspects of how humans as social animals relate to our environment. For instance: the place identity of wind turbines, the racial identity of electric vehicles, the gender of energy transitions, and the morality of climate projections.The overarching goal of the course, then, is to unveil the social causes and effects that are often hidden behind the geophysical models, climatological projections, and economic forecasts of conventional climate science. Specific goals include contributing to local community efforts to respond to climate change, understanding how climate science relates to climate politics, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative approaches to climate sociology.",

The course concludes with students collaborating to create ethical frameworks for decision-making in biotech policy.",

      "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. It is genuinely everything that you can ask for from a Harvard class. First of all, Sergio is one of the best human beings I have ever met in my life. He is the kindest, most attentive, most fascinating, and most engaging teacher that I have had the honor of meeting. To put things into perspective, he wrote EVERY SINGLE STUDENT in a 70+ student class a personalized, handwritten note at the end of the semester and got us all SCRB 120 T\u2013shirts. His final lecture about his personal moral philosophies and perspectives towards biotech ethics was truly one of the most heartwarming and emotional lectures that I've ever heard. He is enough reason for you to take this class. He is captivating, and you can't help but give your 100% attention to him when he speaks. Sergio cares so much about each and every one of his students and is genuinely one of the best that Harvard has to offer.Secondly, the course content is absolutely vital for anyone with an interest in pursuing a career in science, biotech, or medicine. Very rarely do we have the opportunity to engage so freely and openly about the ethical questions that govern biotech advancements, and as someone with a hard science background, thinking about philosophy and morality was a very new perspective that opened so many doors for me. It's an incredible opportunity to grow as a student in a holistic fashion, and you really begin to think carefully about what the future of biotech will entail and how you will be playing an active role in shaping that future. We talk about so many beyond fascinating topics, and I found myself immensely excited for every single lecture.If you're hesitating between taking this class or not, please take it! I promise you that you will not be disappointed. It's also very very light workload\u2013wise, just a few short weekly readings and a discussion post. The case studies are also really chill \u2014 they're essentially just in\u2013class conversations that are graded. It's a super low\u2013stakes way to learn about such important topics with genuinely one of the best professors you'll have the honor of meeting.",

      "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! No matter what your concentration is, you won't regret taking CS32 because in our world where everything is becoming more and more digitalized, having some experience in coding (Python is the language used in CS32) with whatever you do is super beneficial. The concepts from class are so cool and interesting and the homework never feels like busy work because they actually push you to utilize your knowledge to solve the challenge at hand. The course really tries to help students manage stress while doing CS during a busy semester. All the PSETs come with a week of extension time in case you need it. As long as you are not abusing the system (like you actually needed time to figure everything out as a beginner), you'll be fine! The PSETs also offer a safe space for learning because four of the five PSETs don't expect you to be perfect to get a good score. Instead, they just want to see serious effort, logical thinking, and decent usage of knowledge from class. If you put in serious effort, the final code and grade will honestly take care of themselves. The small quizzes throughout the semester are also low stakes (four to five points each) and their main purpose is to act as checkpoints for your understanding. They are meant to be straightforward and beneficial than anything else, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. Ask questions if you find yourself confused at any point. There will be a mix of emotions ranging from determination to frustration to ecstasy, but at the end of the roller coaster, you will walk away feeling proud and satisfied of how much you grew and were able to accomplish. Definitely spread your time out in completing the PSETs because scrambling to finish the code all at once isn't going to cut it. Besides, you will get so much more out of the class if your understanding/epiphany moments are gradual. Definitely go to office hours. Everyone in the staff team is so helpful and kind. And make some friends in CS32! They will make your experience that much better and the memories I got from this course are ones that I love looking back on.",

Koteba is a masquerade performance tradition that utilizes the theatrical elements of satire to comment on and confront civic injustices within the Bamana ethnic society. Koteba is a word that means \u201cbig snail\u201d in the Bamana language, and like the snail, it carries the ideologies and cosmologies of the Bamana people on its back. There are nearly 20 rhythm and movement stylings situated within Koteba. In a multiday festival, these dances are traditionally performed in succession, and often executed with the dancers forming concentric circles, which gives this theater tradition its snail-like name. Traces of this masquerade tradition can be found throughout the Caribbean and the United States in the form of Carnival and Mardi Gras.This class will focus on unpacking four of the dance and rhythm stylings over the course of 12 weeks: (1) Forokotoba, (2) Tansole, and (3) Bara/Baradong. The traditions of Noh drama, Sanskrit theater, and Greek tragedy have informed the development of American dance and theatrical forms, and similarly, a deep investigation of Koteba masquerade performance traditions will offer students of theater and dance informative tools as theorists, practitioners and historians.",

In other words, while some conferences may not view application\u2013heavy papers (such as using AI for conservation) in the same light as a new method for training an LLM, Milind is trying to change that by advocating for recognition of \"AI for Social Impact\" in academia.

This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard\u2019s collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects\u2014things, images, texts\u2014in Harvard\u2019s collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object\u2019s acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard\u2019s collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world. The semester ends with a concrete proposal to the museum regarding areas of the collection that we need to build up to promote the concerns and issues of our own day.",

Additionally, we will examine how the very notions of \u201cchildhood\u201d and \u201cadolescence\u201d are socially constructed, varying across history and cultures rather than stemming from biology alone. We will consider why contemporary constructions of children are so contradictory\u2014sometimes framing them as victims needing protection, and sometimes as deviants needing correction\u2014and what these views say about broader societal anxieties. Next, we will examine several key influences on children\u2019s socialization, highlighting how class, gender and race shape children\u2019s experiences.

    "course_description": "This course studies firms, markets and competition, in the context of today's (globalized) world. Nowadays, in the majority of markets, a handful of firms interact strategically and compete in numerous dimensions, including prices, products offered, advertising and investment. We will use formal models in order to address questions like: Why are markets organized the way they are? How does market organization affect firm behavior, such as firm production or pricing? How does the behavior of firms in turn affect the market structure? How does government policy shape firm behavior and market structure? What is the impact on welfare? Through the use of both theory and data, we will attempt to answer these questions.The course will proceed in three parts. We will first tackle decentralized markets; i.e. markets where many small firms compete in an ad hoc fashion (e.g. taxis, oceanic shipping, real estate). A recent and growing phenomenon in this setup is the emergence of platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, Uber Freight, Airbnb, etc. We will discuss their impact on markets and societal welfare.Then, we will introduce key concepts from the field of Industrial Organization in order to study oligopolistic markets. Through the use of models (mainly game theory) but also empirical analysis, we will explore the strategic interactions between firms and the impact of market power on society. Using these tools, we will study collusion and mergers. We will rely on game theory to analyze the strategic environment under study.Finally, we will study market power in global markets. In a strong recent trend, governments around the world are engaging in industrial policy (e.g. Made in China 2025). What are the rationales behind these initiatives? Are they effective? What is their impact on both domestic and global societal welfare? In this last part of the course we will focus on the role of governments in shaping global competition.The goal of this class is to get you engaged in topics of current interest and heated policy debates; \u201cwhat is market power and how does it affect the world?\u201d, \u201chow has uber changed transportation?\u201d, \u201cdoes industrial policy work?\u201d but also to get you to think about these questions through the rigorous lens of an economist armed with a good combination of formal modeling and empirical tools.",

You will uncover some of the fundamental assumptions (about the world we inhabit, and about our access to that world) that science must proceed from, and thereby become more sophisticated about what science can teach us and what it can\u2019t. By engaging with these foundational aspects of scientific inquiry, you will come to understand more fully what it means to adopt a critical scientific mindset, and how to do so for yourself.

    "course_description": "The duration of education is a strong predictor of health and longevity, but approximately 1 in 5 children with learning or attention issues have long-lasting negative consequences related to their academic, social, mental health, vocational, economic outcomes. In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community. Class activities will include both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the Instructor (Prof. Nadine Gaab), along with breakout sessions overseen by the instructor and/or Teaching Fellows.This course is divided into thirds and will cover: (1) a broad overview of learning disabilities, educational policies, and service documentation; (2) stakeholders in academic and professional settings, including their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, barriers faced by children with learning differences in these settings, existing solutions to these barriers; and (3) stakeholders in community settings, barriers faced by individuals with learners in these settings, existing solutions to these challenges.",

Do preschoolers have ideas or dispositions that help--or hinder--their progress in school? However, one can also ask about the effects of education on psychological processes. There is enormous cross-national and cross-cultural variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help students understand the effects of such variation on the ways that people think--and feel. A secondary goal is to alert students to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods--experiments, large-scale surveys, and participant observation--can make to our understanding of such effects. The final goal is to underline how educational provision and its impact vary dramatically across the globe.Learning Goals:There is enormous variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help you think about and understand the effects of such variation on the way that children end up thinking - and the values they hold. A secondary goal is to alert you to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods - small-scale experiments, large surveys, qualitative and observational studies - can make to our understanding of such effects. The final goal is to underline how far educational provision and its impact have varied in the course of history and currently vary across the globe.Career Focus:This course is co-listed at HGSE and The Harvard Chan School of Public Health. It is designed for masters and doctoral level students from across the University who are interested in the design, testing, and implementation of innovative, science-based strategies to promote the healthy development of young children facing adversity. Aspiring innovators and change agents with an interest in early childhood policy and practice are especially welcome.",

      "this class is a lot of fun and i feel like i learned a lot! however, the presentations left a lot to be desired. most of the time, people were reading slides word for word and just lightly skimming over what we'd read. i think, in my opinion, the point of readings outside of class are such that, during lecture, they can be connected and gone in on more depth, and it more so i felt like i'd done the readings and then just listened to the abstract of each of them in class. that's not necessarily the teaching staff's fault, but i think providing more guidance for what the presentations should look like would be helpful on their end. the guidance that i remember getting when it was my week to present wasn't super helpful and was pretty surface level; maybe they could provide a specific successful slideshow and talk about why that was successful in particular \u2013 ie. the students worked to connect the sources and paint a larger picture rather than keeping them siloed, or the students connected them to other weeks, etc. i'm not sure, it just felt like it could have been more engaging.but again! everyone in the class is lovely, the teaching staff are great, and i still learned a lot :)",

Further development of vocabulary and oral expression within a comprehensive review of Russian grammar. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed as students learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research. Systematic study of word formation and other strategies are taught to help free students from excessive dependence on the dictionary and develop confidence in reading. Vocabulary is thematically organized to include such topics as self and family, education, work, human relationships, politics, and national attitudes and is reinforced through film and the reading of classical and contemporary fiction and history. Practice in the etiquette of common social situations (sociolinguistic competence). Computer exercises on selected topics.",

    "course_description": "This course, taught in small groups and required for concentrators, introduces theories, interpretive frameworks, and central questions about literature and literary media. What do we do when we read? What is an author? What do we mean by \u201cliterature\u201d itself? How might we compare and evaluate interpretations? How do the historical, social, cultural, and legal frameworks around a text shape its meanings and its effects? Combining major critical and theoretical writings with primary works, the course investigates how literary production and interpretation are informed by philosophical and aesthetic traditions, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, national and post-colonial identities, and the material forms in which literature circulates, from parchment books to the internet. Students will also practice fundamental literary research methods through close engagement with Harvard libraries.",
