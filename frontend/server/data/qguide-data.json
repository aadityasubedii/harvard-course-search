Politics of Paradise offers an incredibly engaging and thoughtful exploration of tourism, colonialism, and the erasure of indigenous and local perspectives. The readings and lectures were consistently captivating, and the experiential learning component, with its mini excursions, brought the material to life in ways I never expected.This course fundamentally shifted how I think about Latin America and the Caribbean, encouraging me to critically examine the complexities of these regions and the forces that shape their narratives. The weekly discussion posts were a highlight—this was the first time I genuinely looked forward to reading my classmates’ contributions, as they always added depth to the topics we explored.Professor Henry’s teaching approach was exceptional.

And the meditation at the beginning of  class was always a treat! Professor Aumoithe is a wonderful and calming person and presence. He does an amazing job facilitating discussion and asks questions that really make you think. His feedback is also easy to understand and incorporate.Workload–wise, the class is less demanding than it previously was. However, it is not necessarily an easy class. You definitely need to stay on top of the weekly discussion posts and other assignments because they will creep up on you.

      "I would take this course only if you have a serious community partner and project in mind, and you are independent and self–motivated.",
      "Andi is an absolutely gem of a human! She really embodies the spirit of care in who she is as a person and educator, as expected in a course of this nature. That said, the course has a lot of potential, but falls a bit short in the way your work with the community ultimately comes secondary to more academic discussions of care work."

It's a shame that Prof. Kleinman is retiring and won't teach this again (but the retirement is certainly well–deserved).

      "CS1090a is an AMAZING course. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm to anyone interested. I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q–guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. Advantages of CS109a:0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students' learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students' understanding of the material.  1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. 2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi–weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time–consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10–20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi–weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast–paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don't look back!",
      "Pavlos is great and it's easy to tell that he cares a lot. It's also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job–skills wise if that's what you're going for.That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics–wise. This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn't reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us \"you guys did a great job\" as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you're on track or not in the course.My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare–tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take–home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms/assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF–ing, while student B ends up with an A– because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.",

      "So, if you're reading this, you're deciding whether to take Math 21b or Math 22a, and you've stumbled across the forgotten APMTH 22a.Let me list you out the pros and cons.Pros:––1 PSET a week, around 8–9 problems (with multiple parts, that in total probably amount to 30 questions overall). Due every Friday at 11:59pm. This is obviously much better than Math 21b's 3 PSET's a week.––No proofs like in Math 22a, although most of the time you spend on PSETs will be answering True or False questions that require justification. Best to do this numerically/algebraically or with a counterexample, if you really want to avoid relying on the Theorems and any associated proofs. If you're taking a course like CS20, CS120, or some other proof based class, then you should already be growing your mathematical maturity in those classes, and that should be enough.––Supposedly, partner PSETs. Although, as of writing this for 2024 Fall, Margo Levine is covering for the professor that is on sabbatical, and removed this benefit.––Supposedly, 80% of your grade comes from the PSETs. Margo also changed this into a standard grading percentage. If the regular professor is back, both of these will be benefits for you.––PSETs do not take extremely long. I was able to start and complete many of them after I finished my STAT 110 homework (due every Friday at 5:15pm). So it took me around 7 hours in total just to complete it all. Not bad for not visiting office hours and not showing up to lecture.––4 late days. I was quite grateful for this.––Exams are quite easy. Do the homework, and you will understand most of the content you need for the exams. I only studied by doing a single practice exam the night of (12am–6am grind).Cons:––Classes are at 9AM MWF. Attendance is required, although attendance was already going to be required in Math 21b anyways (not sure about Math 22a). No engagement during lecture, everyone is silent because it's a 9AM class. Does lead to a few moments of awkwardness, but not the end of the world. No shade to Margo as a person or even as a teacher, she is genuinely great at both. ––Because this class is so small (maybe 30 ppl? can't tell cause maybe half the class actually shows up to lecture), you won't get as much support as you would in the alternative classes. Decide if this is worth it. Ultimately ChatGPT can  often be a substitute for learning these topics if you really need it.––Also as a consequence of the small support size, you will be getting your PSETs back very late. I am still waiting on my PSET I submitted 2 months ago as of writing this, although solutions are posted.––You learn Matlab. CS majors, this is not a language you are likely to use in your career. If you have absolutely 0 programming experience, I could imagine you struggling quite a lot.  Perhaps this is useful for engineers, but I doubt it. I don't know if this will last for the next semester, but Margo was kind enough to allow us to use Python instead of Matlab (which, if you've taken CS109 or even if you're just generally ok with Python, you will want to do this). Python code for this class gets a little messy because of numpy and matplotlib having lengthy notation, but it makes it a lot easier to code with for those who are more CS–inclined.––You may need to watch a few videos on linear algebra on YouTube to actually understand what you're doing. I'd suggest the Essence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown. Short videos, no actual math, just watch them as recaps on what you're doing when you perform the operations you learn in class (especially for what a basis is). This is all I can think of. I think the cons of the alternative classes outweigh the cons of Math 22a. Pick the lesser evil. Save yourself the effort. Otherwise, when you're drowning in your work for the alternatives, you can think back to this Q–guide comment I made and wish you would've chosen the easier path. Good luck, soldier.",

Substantially improves your modeling toolkit and exposes you high level to a whole host of interesting and connected areas of applied mathematics, which you will have seen perhaps elsewhere in other courses. I recommend you take this toward the end of your AM degree –– I took as a senior –– because it lets you become acquainted in depth with the subjects and techniques in other classes (ie stat, optimization, coding, etc) before being asked to tackle them and apply them for yourself in this class. The projects are super interesting and very free form – you can work on what you are interested in (you will know better what interests you as a senior than as a freshman!). The grading does not seem excessively punishing at all, the Prof is super passionate for the subject and just wants to see you give it a good go. The first p set is very challenging and daunting, but dont be afraid – p sets are not weekly, there are only four total, and they get easier. Overall would strongly recommend the class even outside of its implications for the AM degree, modeling is a fantastic skillset and is taught passionately and not arduously here.",

Having the class be over once reading period starts was also great as it allowed me to balance out my schedule. The material in this class is sometimes hard to work with or understand, but the quizzes test much more fundamental material which you can get the hang of through practice problems. I definitely recommend studying for the quiz at least two days before, but much more than that is probably not necessary. Overall, a great way to fulfill a requirement for AM or just your interest.",

Although incredibly qualified and intelligent, she lacks the personability of professors who want to form rapport with their students and care about their learning. Often, she dismisses students with questions, or she almost acts offended that one has such a question. – AMPL is an awful coding environment/language around which to center this course. It should be Python. At the beginning of the class, no one, even the TFs, knew how to work AMPL properly. Often, there would be errors in the program, and the TFs would have no idea how to offer solutions.– Some readings had an egregious amount of errors. One reading had a mistake that was quizzed on! Why are we reading, learning, and taking notes on readings that have errors, and then quizzed on them? – The extreme optimization assignments are a waste of time.",

      "This is a good course. You will most definitely learn a lot, and I've learned things that I think I'll genuinely use for the remainder of my degree and research. Doing the textbook readings was helpful to comprehend the class material, but if you've got a very strong linear algebra background it might not be needed (more on the textbook later). The psets are good, I found quite a few of them enjoyable, and they're all reasonably scoped (taking 3–4 hours each). So if you add the psets with quiz review and readings for the lecture, you're looking at a fairly light workload for the course. Grading is all quick, and you get reasonable feedback for graded assignments. The lectures do a great job blending whiteboard instruction and matlab demonstrations of concepts, so you get the theory and practical application of most of what you learn. We haven't gotten project grades back at the time of writing, but I definitely spent a large portion of time (upwards of 30–40 hours) on the final project, but I'm not sure how that will translate grade wise. The quizzes, if you're reading Heath (if Heath is the textbook) and paying attention in class, you will still fail. I walked out of 2 of the 3 quizzes, content knowing that if I'd studied 10–15 more hours for the quiz and done every practice question in the back of the Heath chapters, I still would've done poorly. With a fairly robust postmortem of the first quiz to see how I could've studied more efficiently I'd come to the conclusion that the only way to stumble upon the information needed to answer the question was random chance googling or GenAI responses (because the material was absent in the textbook and lecture notes). Doing a thorough lit review for my final project, though, I found that Dr Trefethen had his own Numerical Computation textbook, and I was fairly shocked to find that all of the questions I thought were unreasonable on the quizzes were either explicit in his textbook or easily inferred from the information in his textbook. I'm not sure if this was deliberate, or just an extension of \"he thinks these are very important numerical computation concepts, noted by him putting them on the quiz and also in his textbook, but the two events aren't deliberately correlated\". The largest recommendation that I would have is to use his textbook to follow his lectures and prepare for his quizzes. I didn't find Heath particularly effective, and our lectures jumped around Heath so frequently that you'd skip large sections in certain chapters anyways. Our TFs were completely amazing – and I wanted to make sure to give them a shout out here. Elaine and Chuin Wei in particular put in a lot of work to help prepare students for quizzes and help students understand lectures. Chuin Wei's notes were better than mine most of the time, definitely helping prepare as best you could for the quizzes. Grading was incredibly fast (got most assignments back within a week), and generally fair. TFs rocked.",
      "Trefethen is very passionate about the subject matter, and it does show in his teaching. The lectures are good and problem sets are reasonable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the exams. There are 3 exams and, in general, they are extremely unreasonable. In a strange way, the exams aren't objectively that hard; they just require you to have exactly the right intuition about everything. Unfortunately, having the right intuition cannot be taught or learnt in one semester. And only Trefethen himself had that intuition, even amongst the teaching staff.  The result is that most people fail the exams, even after generous grading (and partial credit) by Trefethen. The exams feel less like a test of what you have learnt in the class and more a test of just naturally what your raw IQ is. There really is no way to prepare for the tests, either. You can read the textbook cover to cover and know and understand everything in the course perfectly well, but still fail the tests. Overall, I did learn quite a bit in this course. However, I also felt that most of the course content was quite dated, and should not be mandatory for students in the CSE program to learn.",
      "This is a class that is required for the Applied Math masters, but I think that everyone in the computational sciences should take it even if it isn't required! A gem of a class and there is more than enough support for students of various backgrounds to succeed. Course staff was awesome this year and Nick is an awesome lecturer and awesome computational scientist. You'll learn so much just from hearing him talk, but also make an effort to ask questions and converse with both him and course staff, especially around the project at the end of the semester."

(if you haven't you should be able to pick it up very easily as well). in terms of workload, the class is super light with only like 4 psets (and one is dropped lmao), a midterm, and a final project. the content isn't super hard and i think the algorithms are presented in a way that are pretty intuitive, but this class is still worth your time because it's just a good way to practice your stat and cs skills in a pretty chill way (you have a lot of freedom on the final project and most grad students just do a project related to their research)",

There is a final project which was difficult and the feedback was confusing since I lost points for my problem solving being \"toy\", but was told it was a good project and there was no feedback on what could've been improved.",

This course absolutely suffered from \"this is the first semester it was taught\", and it was incredibly disorganized as a result, but it was my favorite course of the semester despite that. That said? The material is cool. It's very cool, I thought. We covered a wide range of topics, some I was familiar with and some I wasn't, and the crux of the class was basically \"here's this cool topic. Here are some cool applications. We'll give you the latitude to explore them\". The material provided in the course gave you ample opportunity to explore the topics you wanted to explore, and that was incredibly well done. I think the course also gave you the space to explore potential topics without fear of failure. For instance, our second project explored a topic that just didn't work. We thought it was a cool idea, maybe it would work, it didn't, and we explained why in the report and that was fine. The pacing on the course does feel a bit off, which I think will also be resolved with subsequent iterations of the class. We seemingly blitzed through all of the material in the first ~15 lectures, with very very large psets by merit of the large amount of topics we'd discussed, and then had, practically, nothing for the last 10 classes, which left very little time to deeply understand the material unless you decided to play around with the material in your project. The workload in this class is also a lot. More than you would hope for to have time to play with the concepts. Some of the section notebooks took upwards of 3 hours, the projects could reasonably be done with ~30–40 man hours, but there were 3 of them, and the psets were an absolute slog, mostly due to the software development component below. The software development component of the class misses the mark. I definitely understand why it's there – I think more and more we're using collab notebooks and code to solve interesting problems (demonstrated with the projects in this class), but the way it's integrated doesn't quite make sense. We had M/W lectures covering math topics, and a F lecture for software, but the software lecture wasn't tied into the math lectures, and the way these were combined was to just have the problem sets for the math component, but tack on \"write a test suite achieving x coverage on your tests, with robust python scripts\".

As many suggest from previous Q–Reports, AP50a is a course where you will learn literally NOTHING, but walk away with an A as long as you put in the time and effort (although be forewarned, that time is going to be A LOT).For context, the structure of the class includes a LOT of weekly assignments, as listed below:• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Reading Assessment: you are expected to read about 20–30 pages in the textbook and leave about 10–15 comments to ‘stimulate conversation’ with your peers• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Readiness Assurance (Individual): you complete around 10–20 practice questions individually based on the topics you learned from reading• Tuesday by 9 AM – Tutorial (Individual): you complete an application–based assignment on Desmos consisting of about 20–30 slides on the weekly topics you learned from reading• Tuesday IN CLASS – Tutorial (Team): you review over the Desmos tutorial assignment with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Tuesday by 6 PM – Readiness Assurance (Team Round): you re–visit the Readiness Assurance from Sunday with your team and re–submit what you think is correct – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday by 9 AM – Challenge (Individual): you complete a 3 question problem set individually before class and submit to Gradescope• Thursday IN CLASS – Challenge (Team): you review over your challenge with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday IN CLASS – Skill Session: you take your newly learned concepts from the week and put it into practice by completing different activities + a short Canvas quiz – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADEDAs you can see, there are a minimum of at least EIGHT weekly assignments you will have to do in AP50, which combined with the in–class component, means that you are spending around 15 hours/week MINIMUM to complete your objectives. The plus side to this is that AP50a contains NO EXAMS and also only grades your TEAM sessions, which means that only your CORRECTED copy of the Challenge + Tutorial are counted. However, this makes for a very unintuitive and time consuming way of learning, as you have no lectures and only learn based off of a short textbook reading and some random assignments. The truth about AP50a is, if you do all of the tasks outlined above, you are GUARANTEED an A. They do not lie or trick students, and are very straight forward with the requirements. However, just be warned that you MUST stay on track and complete EVERYTHING on time, as even missing ONE assignment or having ONE dissatisfactory grade will automatically bump you down a letter grade. As a result, AP50a is only a good fit for those that are able to stay on top of their work.From a classroom dynamics perspective, AP50 is very interesting. In terms of the teaching team, some of the TFs do not seem adequately prepared and often make odd mistakes. Every Tuesday and Thursday, students do “check in sessions” with the TF where they present their group’s final answers to the Tutorial and/or Challenge and get feedback. However, there have been multiple instances of TFs either being extremely rude and unhelpful, or straight up providing inaccurate and wrong information. This also extends to grading, where they have accidentally docked students for things they cannot even identify later on when asked. This even extends into the actual structure of the class, as there have been multiple instances where there are issues with the Canvas page or associated assignments (as with a huge banner across one of the Tutorials on Demos telling the teaching team to remove a section of the assignment, even though it was still there and had already been published). Unfortunately, this made the class seem very poorly unorganized and like an afterthought in some regards.Now that we’re a semester in, to be honest, I do not think I have learned much from AP50a. Although the course boasts this reputation and *big idea* of using a different teaching approach that is meant to enable students to learn by DOING, the course falls short of this in many ways. At the end of the day, you will basically turn into an automated machine each week with completing each of the assignments, without ever really taking the material in and LEARNING. However, as mentioned above, you will be guaranteed an A as long as you can keep up.With all of this in mind, I think that AP50a is a good course if you are solely looking for a good grade, as you WILL earn an A as long as you do everything. However, do not enter with the expectation to truly learn, and be ready to spend countless moments of the semester focused on the next, upcoming assignment for AP50a to ensure you keep that A.",
      "Be very careful with this class. The idea of having no exams, and just \"having to complete my work\" sounded amazing. What I didn't know was how incredibly laborious and PAINFUL that work was. The structure of the course is so beyond convoluted and confusing, there is SO much work to do and so many deadlines throughout the week, the TFs are incredibly picky with the wording you use and the way you say things, and the whole class you feel like you're scrambling to finish. When I signed up, I read the Q reports and thought \"ok well how bad can it actually really be?\" – the answer was BAD.",

      "If Lene Hau is teaching this course, do NOT take it if you are an undergrad. Maybe even if you're a grad student. Unless you are specifically interested in her research and *exactly* her research alone. Don't get me wrong, she's very smart and knowledgeable. But only take it if you want to do a basic fluffy review of E&M, then just obscure problems on sodium lasers and BECs and a bit about fiber optics, and not much else. The course is unstructured. While it provides interesting topics, it's too painstakingly dissected to feel like you get the big picture, with not much effort made to connect the topics to a broader context or other research disciplines (e.g work you might be doing as a grad student) other than the professor's research focus. Seriously, if you think you're going to get anything like a functional experimental understanding of optics, you're emphatically not. The closest you will come is an abstract understanding that lenses are Fourier transformers.Now, about grading: Hau is unforgiving and totally unwilling to compromise or understand the student's perspective (especially undergraduates from what I saw) on any of this. There are only six psets, and they are worth a lot of your grade. They will be graded harshly. Seriously, we all either got 100% because we painstakingly went to office hours to learn exactly what they want to see on the pset, or lost like 20–30% for small mistakes. This course is graded like it's the 1950s,  where B's were passing, so don't take it if you're an undergrad trying to get into competitive graduate school. Lastly, the final project and paper. You can work your butt off on the final presentation and paper, some real good work, but if it's not what the professor wants specifically, then you might get nailed. And regarding these projects: you need to know that these are not necessarily  \"literature reviews\" in that sense. The projects that Hau will give A's to fall into three categories: 1) she wanted you to do a literature review on an area she is interested in, so that she can maybe adapt some of the techniques for her own research (e.g. you basically do work for her interests). 2) You did some silly fun area that sounds cool and she doesn't know much about and she's entertained. 3) You went for a review of class materials and things she already knows: you will get grilled during the presentation on questions from the class.... have fun! <3 <3",

      "This is a great course to learn about single–molecule imaging techniques. The class emphasizes imaging so bear that in mind. It is very much a methods of biophysics course. Although Max makes full use of the class time, each imaging technique is super complicated to actually execute (many would take months/years to set up in a lab). Thus, don't expect to acquire super deep knowledge about any of them. However, you will leave with an understanding of the basic principles, maths, physics, and biological applications relevant to each. Also, Max certainly does not have enough time to really derive the important optical results from first–principles.  But he does take the time to introduce you to Fourier analysis and other topics so that you can have a decent understanding of those results and how to work with them. He also has great and detailed lecture notes. Speaking as a physics undergrad, I would say that this course is accessible for anyone who knows elementary code (for loops) and is at about the Math 21 level. I had not taken biology since 10th grade and was able to swing it. Likewise, many of the bio–oriented kids  (APPHY 242 is cross–listed as MCB 161)  in the class had not taken physics in a while. Since psets are pretty light (1–2 questions), you can get the help you need if you are struggling.

This was not an issue because I loved spending time printing, editing, doing photo lab work, taking photos outside...for me, it was never a burden per se. But it can become one if your semester is already very hectic and you are not that excited about photography. You take what you put in, as with most classes at Harvard. If you dive deep this can be a truly transformative experience, it definitely was one for me. Make sure to be present and enjoy all the resources (we had a free trip to NYC, so cool).",

      "One of my FAVORITE courses in my 4 years at Harvard. Here's what I gained:1) Broadened my understanding of what a non–fiction film can be2) Enriched my appreciation of film and ability to communicate ideas in film–language3) Taught me how to use a professional film camera4) Taught me how to edit videos in Adobe Premiere Pro5) Created three short films that I'm proud of!I had little to no film experience before this class and came out of it feeling confident that I can use filmmaking / video making as a story telling tool. It's a great mix between watching/discussing films, learning technical skills, and creating your own short films. You are encouraged to take creative risks and give/receive honest feedback on your projects.If you are a creative thinker, are openminded to feedback, and can figure things out via google / youtube / chatGPT, and are willing to put in the work, you'll do well. In weeks before a deadline, filming & editing will take a lot of time, but it's fun work. Wish I would have taken an AFVS class sooner!",

It was really empowering to learn things that I can actually use (in my art practice and regular life) and to build things with my own hands. Pascale did an amazing job of demystifying tools and methods that can seem inaccessible and intimidating.The assignments are structured enough to give you an idea of what is expected, but open enough to allow you plenty of artistic freedom. The assignments could take me a long time, but I often didn't even notice because they were so much fun to work on. The final project can be demanding, but was really enjoyable and rewarding! I appreciated that this class is accessible to anyone (coding experience in the class ranged from none to very experienced/skilled).

      "It’s not a class for those who are looking for a straightforward, step–by–step approach to creating art—be ready to try new techniques, make mistakes, and learn from them.That said, critique sessions can be challenging. They’re different from what you might be used to, and at times, they can feel more intimidating or harsh. I’m not sure if it’s because of the tone set by the instructor or the general nervous energy in the room, but the critiques can sometimes feel daunting. Be prepared for a more intense, high–pressure environment—I've seen several students struggle with it. Some have even become emotional after critiques (MULTIPLE FRIENDS/CLASSMATES HAVE CRIED TO ME ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS....), so just know you're not alone if you're feeling overwhelmed. I think the course could benefit from clearer, more supportive standards for feedback.Despite that, the course is an excellent space for artistic exploration. If you’re looking to push your boundaries, try new things, and learn, it’s a great fit. Just keep in mind that the journey can be challenging, and the pressure can feel heavy at times.

It is truly one of the most unique and interesting classes I've taken here at Harvard, and it makes you appreciate the importance of a \"visual\" education. It's very easy to take courses that teaches typical Harvard stuff (CS, math etc.) but Professor Stilgoe's discussions are of a Harvard that has rapidly faded in the previous decades. You will learn so much from knowing about the old Harvard (for instance, don't worry at all about the midterm). His lectures are all based on images, and the readings are long but really insightful. If you want a class that will make you *think* about your life, the world around you, and the stuff you see on a daily basis, you MUST take this class. While some of his remarks may seem out of place (I know I don't usually agree with his political leanings but it's always nice to hear a different perspective, which is something that is sorely needed in today's Harvard), that shouldn't detract you from appreciating his vast knowledge of the American landscape and its history. This isn't a course solely about the built environment: it's about the people who inhabit it. If you're interested in people, this is the course for you.",

      "DO NOT take this class if it is taught by Professor Giuliana Bruno or the TF Aden Solway. You can try it out if it is with another professor. This is truly one of the worst courses I’ve taken in my entire academic career. I do not understand how a course—especially one that serves as a requirement for new AFVS graduate students and has been in existence for years—could be taught in such a way. 1. Lack of Basic Organization: I don’t understand why some readings are included in the syllabus when they weren’t discussed or connected to any future readings. Each week feels completely disjointed from the others. While I understand that this is intended to be a broad survey course in Film & Visual Studies, it neither traces the genealogy of theoretical engagement within the field nor even attempts to explain why the figures we read are important. It feels more like a list of readings than a cohesive curriculum. I’m sure that other professors, who are more familiar with the field’s recent developments, could have created a syllabus that is more relevant and engaging. 2. Lack of Structured Class Time: We did not have “class” in the traditional sense. I’ve experienced many different styles of teaching in graduate seminars, and I’m usually very open to them. However, this class was beyond me. I don’t understand how a two–hour class is structured into: one hour of student presentations, 50 minutes of the professor telling trivia and life stories, and 10 minutes of questions from the teaching fellow, often focusing on irrelevant issues and grilling people on them. I had many questions and would have loved to discuss them with my classmates. Our cohort brought diverse knowledge from various fields, but we were never allowed the time to engage with each other. Because of the time spent on other “important” matters, I didn’t learn much in this class, and I’m sure my classmates would agree with me. A professor who genuinely cared about how their class went would have noticed that student participation stopped after Week 5. While you might think this means that it's less work for you, it is not. You're left confused on all the assignments and all the \"instructions\" come post hoc in the form of criticism on things you didn't even know were in consideration.  3. Lack of Accessibility from the Professor: The professor is NEVER accessible. The only interaction I had with Professor Giuliana Bruno was when I asked her a question after class, and her response was a single sentence. She doesn’t respond to emails, does not hold office hours, and never provides any feedback on our assignments. I don’t understand why she’s considered a “teacher.” On the bright side, she is not a mean person. She will say hi to you if you encounter each other in the Carpenter Center.  4. Disparaging Teaching Fellow: The teaching fellow, Aden Solway, was incredibly disparaging to everyone. Office hours with him were awful, as the 30–minute session consisted of him tearing apart your project, diminishing its value, and pushing his own ideas onto it, trying to bend it to what he deemed worthy. The TF is the only person that grades anything and gives you feedback. I don’t think he should be allowed to teach until he learns how to respect his peers and the work of others.",

      "LISTEN TO ME! This course is NOT a gem, or easy, or anything like that. On the contrary, this course requires a stupendous amount of work, both in the classroom and out. This is a very conceptually difficult class because of how new/different the material is (most people have never studied something like this before) as well as the volume of material that is taught on (CelNav is a very complex discipline with many moving parts). In the beginning of the semester I thought that the Tuesday night labs (19–2200) were going to be relatively easy but as the semester progressed, they became a significant drain on both my time to complete other assignments as well as my sleep schedule. The star/sun journal that they make you keep is also extremely time consuming. The P–Sets can be nightmarish, depending on how well you know the material. Why you should take this course is because you will never get another chance to do celestial navigation again in your life. My advice would be take this class pass–fail, make every use of office hours (which they are very generous with), and use this class to satisfy your QRD requirement. The professor and the teaching staff are extremely personable and likable people who love students.Take the class, but don't let anyone say that it wasn’t work. The only difference is that this is work worth doing. Also, Max, you are always in our hearts. Gone, never forgotten",
      "It is definitely fun to take the class but it is a TON of work!!! There were lots of times doing problem sets led my partner and I to almost break down crying. Make sure you find out when office hours are in advance and are okay with blocking them off in your schedule because they are essentially necessary to be able to pass",

The TFs are helpful, but I felt like section was not a hugely productive use of my time. Professor Eisenstein is really kind and definitely knows his stuff (he's pretty much a genius and is the originator for some of the stuff you will learn in cosmology). Be sure to do the textbook reading! All of the midterm and half of the final exam is qualitative, drawing on pretty detailed recollections from the modules and textbook. The exams are pretty tricky, and I had a decently hard time with the final. It's hard to study for everything, but the teaching team's approach was to recommend looking over *everything.* This is, of course, hard to balance when you have a lot of qualitative and quantitative materials at the same time. Nevertheless, I thought it was a fair and decent introduction to lots of fascinating phenomena in astrophysics.",

      "Astro110 is an AWESOME class. Professor Johnson's teaching style is great because after learning the basics, you get split into groups and work on problems together. For someone who is a learn–by–doing type, this was a great way to actually feel solid in the concepts, and also made every class fun and different from the last, not just constant lectures. There is homework on a regular basis, but I honestly found it enjoyable for the most part (except 1 pset that was very very hard). The homework generally was challenging in a good way and never stressed me out at all, never was unreasonable, and never took way too long like some other classes. The midterm consisted of having to teach someone who knows nothing about astrophysics what we were learning in this class. This was the best midterm I have ever had. It was not only really fun, but it actually genuinely helped solidify the concepts, while not having to be stressed out about a sit–down midterm. Having experience in Python will be helpful, but you can learn it on the fly if you need to; just be prepared for the fact that it will be there. Similarly, Astro 16 can be helpful background but def not a requirement, I was fine without it. If you're interested in exoplanets or astrophysics in general, take this class!!",

      "This course includes material that is foundational to every area of astrophysics, and thus I recommend that every astrophysicist learns this material. However, the quality of this course is HIGHLY dependent on who is teaching it. Professor Loeb's lectures were very rushed and unprepared, and he refused to write down any derivations (citing that it was a \"waste of time\") which made it unnecessarily difficult to follow the lectures in class. Professor Loeb would also often go on self–referential tangents about his encounters with his fans and prescribed his own blog posts as required reading. I think that a better lecturer would make this course much less frustrating and much more rewarding. The problem sets are generally reasonable, though there will be some random problem sets that are significantly harder and more time–consuming than the others – I would recommend starting those early and going to office hours. The TFs were fantastic this semester, and the section notes from previous TFs were also very helpful.",
      "The content of AY200 is crucial to astrophysical research but I would absolutely not recommend you take the class with Prof. Loeb. While he is clearly very knowledgable in all of the subject material, he put very little effort into communicating it clearly during lectures. Much of the course relies on gaining an intuitive understanding of the underlying physics to astrophysical phenomena, and Prof. Loeb's lecture format of projecting lecture notes handwritten by another instructor and briefly explaining them in front of the class did not achieve this. In addition, lectures often diverged from course content into advertisements for Prof. Loeb's blog/media appearances and discussions of his views on the state of the scientific community, which were distracting, uncomfortable, and unprofessional.",

      "BE 110 IS NOT THAT BAD. Just calm down for a second. If you're considering BME/BioE or are already in it and looking ahead at what you have to take, just TAKE A BREATH. Now––this course has gained like a sort of mythical reputation. And it made me hesitant to do BME/BioE. But after taking it, I just don't see why. Sure, it was hard. And the MATLAB was a pain (as MATLAB is, but literally just like ES 53). And honestly, the subject matter was definitely not the hardest I've ever encountered. Math 21B was LEAGUES harder than this class in terms of downright confusing material. And some of the tests weren't easy, sure (averages in the mid 70's for the midterms) but the final was actually easy––91.5% average––and that's the AVERAGE!!! So don't be like me. DON'T GET SCARED BY THIS CLASS. The Q Guide stats on this class have gone up and down for BE 110 over the years. I used to think there was a reason why. Like maybe it changed or something? No, there's no actual reason. It's the same class, but Maurice is a bit eccentric and teaches it at a different pace every year. The only thing I would say is that this class takes a good amount of time every week. Though honestly, a lot of people were in ES 181 (Thermodynamics, which is also a bit of a time suck), and they seemed fine. Me personally––I had the busiest, most jam–packed semester of my entire college career, and I was still able to score the average or higher on the exams and turn in all of the assignments. Maurice is not scary, just a bit eccentric. He cares about his students and will do all he can to accommodate your needs, especially since he knows the class is kinda hard. He even brings pizza to the review sessions!Also, as you may have heard, this class has a VERY gracious \"curve,\" so put in the effort and you'll be just fine––yes, even the pre–med among you reading this. TLDR: BE 110 IS NOT THAT BAD. Just take the class. It's challenging and takes some time every week, but it does not deserve the notorious reputation it has. Honestly, easier than some of the other classes you have to take in BME/BioE (looking at you, Math 21B). And I beg of you––DO NOT let this dissuade you from your dream of going into BME/BioE.",
      "Professor Maurice: Maurice is definitely the strength of this class. He is very kind and extremely accommodating. If you need an extension for any reason, just ask, and he’ll give it to you—no problem, no questions asked. Honestly, I think a lot of people end up needing those extensions because this class can be anxiety–inducing. Also, he buys pizza for review sessions :) Super sweet of him especially because the course load made me skip a lot of meal times!Course Stress and Workload: I wouldn’t recommend this class if you’re taking other difficult courses. The workload is intense, and exam weeks are brutal. Expect all–nighters and lots of stress. I've heard of groups staying in office hours until 5 a.m. to get help, and I personally felt like I couldn’t eat during exam weeks—it was just too overwhelming. It’s not just hard, it’s stressful to the point of affecting your mental health.Course Structure and Lectures: That said, the lectures themselves were a mess. Maurice’s teaching style wasn’t very clear. He often went too fast or too slow, and I couldn’t follow his explanations half the time. His writing on the board was hard to read because it was too small or often blocked by him. SIT IN THE FRONT. This made the lectures feel inaccessible. If you’re someone who needs visual clarity in lectures, you’ll struggle here. Otherwise, HE IS THE SMARTEST PERSON EVER. I don't think it's his fault that we aren't getting the material... it's just a lot.Teaching Fellows and Office Hours: The Teaching Fellows (TFs) were a huge help, but office hours were always packed. It was like a fight just to get your question answered, and by the time you did, you might feel even more confused. The course doesn’t really set you up with enough support—like when you need help, it’s usually either waiting forever to get in with a TF or just trying to figure things out with classmates. By then, it’s basically the blind leading the blind, and that’s not ideal when you’re struggling with complex material.Grading and Midterm/PSET Drop: On the plus side, there is a midterm and PSET drop, which can ease some of the pressure. But still, the overall experience is exhausting.Final Thoughts: Overall, I would not recommend this course if you have a choice. But if you have to take it as a requirement, just be prepared for a very stressful and chaotic experience. Stay on top of things early, try to use the resources you have, and don’t be afraid to ask for extensions if you need them.Good luck, you’ll need it.",

Even amongst his busy schedule, he stays engaged throughout the entire lecture and every student presentation. Additionally, Mooney is very available outside of class, and always made time to check in when any group needed it. The main component of the class is the in–class journal club presentations. These can feel very scary and challenging at first, but by the end of the semester I was much more comfortable discussing the journal club papers in front of the class.

      "TL;DR: Chem 30 is the hardest class I've ever taken, but is super rewarding. Professor Myers is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff, but be prepared to spend A LOT of time on this class memorizing the material. Here's how the course worked for me: in class, Professor Myers presented a flurry of mechanisms and reactions, and I quickly copied those down (be prepared to write fast). I didn't really understand them the first time around (this is okay) because it's a challenge to keep up with Myers' pace, but it's nothing to worry about Next, I would attempt the Lecture Integration problems (a short worksheet based on the new content from the last lecture that is due every lecture)  to test my knowledge. Then, I would look over the pset and see how much I remembered, and do the first few problems. Then, I would look back at the lecture boards / lecture recordings as a guide, and attempt all the other problems, and go to office hours and check everything one more time before submitting my pset. For tests, there are ample practice materials, but be sure to do ALL of them: I know I definitely needed the practice. If you do all the practice materials, the exams will feel fair and simple.Chem 30 is a HARD class, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Everyone is pretty much in the same boat: you will need to memorize a LOT of reactions, but it all feels fun and new. Your synthetic capabilities will grow exponentially compared to just having taken Chem 20. Finally, the community in the course is excellent. The teaching staff is absolutely stellar: they are super qualified and really know their stuff. The other students are also struggling through the same content you are, so it's not hard to make new friends. All in all, Chem 30 demands a large time commitment, but is an awesome class with great people.",
      "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I really enjoyed Chem 20, but this class is a mess and the high reviews on the Q guide are very misleading because it is filled with Chemistry majors that will rank chemistry classes high regardless of whether it is a good class. If you are not a chemistry major, I would highly advise taking Chem 27 instead. I think the optimal series is Chem 20 and then Chem 27.There are many problems with Chem 20:1) it is simply a memorization game––there are hundreds of reactions given to you and you simply have to memorize the reagents involved, the mechanisms involved, and when to use them. Any one of them could show up at any time, on any assignment. Unlike Chem 20 where I felt like I was learning a new way of thinking about chemistry, this course was just drilling reaction after reaction into my brain, which wasn't fun or rewarding. If you took Chem 20, you have already learned how to do synthesis; you don't need this class to advance that skill.2) The structure of this course is really bad all around. First, don't let the 2x a week lectures fool you. These lectures consist of Professor Myers writing reaction after reaction after reaction after reaction on the board. Then it is entirely on you to actually learn the material. You will retain essentially nothing in lecture and Professor Myers does nothing to engage students during the lectures. Second, EVERYTHING IS ON PAPER, which may sound fine, but it gets really frustrating because you have to print everything (the daily lecture problems and the problem sets) if you do work on the iPad. This was a bit crazy for 2024. Third, there was often complex material on the problem sets that was taught the day before the long PSETS were due, which meant trying to watch youtube videos that covered the material or begging CAs for the answers because there just wasn't enough time to wait to actually learn the material in class.3) Some of the exam questions were unfair and covered material that wasn't taught. After we got the test back, I tried to find where some of the material was in the course materials and frequently it just wasn't there. The material is hard enough that asking about material that wasn't taught or introduced is a bit unfair.____________Finally, if you are premed, this class is not a way around the 17/27 series. You will learn more and find the material more interesting in the Chem 17/27 classes. This class is very hard and filled with people who have been doing chemistry their entire life (olympiad kids and international chemistry kids), so even if the curve is slightly more generous, you are taking this class with an entirely different population of people than Chem 17 and 27.

      "Chem 110 is a good course, but has some caveats. The content of the course is definitely the biggest strength: it was super cool to see how to apply chemistry and biology to therapeutic development, which is very much still an emerging and prevalent science. Professor Shair is extremely knowledgeable, and as the founder of a biopharma company (Nuvalent) himself, he knows all the ins and outs of the industry. However, the course does have some quirks and drawbacks, namely, the workload, community, and office hours and feedback.– Workload. On average, this class is not a lot of work at all, but the workload is just extremely concentrated. There are only 5 assignments: A section presentation on a week of your choice, 2 Psets, a Midterm (which is a glorified Pset with less time and no collaboration), and a Final Project. On weeks when you don't have any of these to do, the course is extremely chill, only about an hour of out–of–classroom time for the week (you only need to read a paper for section and that's it– lecture attendance is not recorded and you can watch it whenever you want). However, on weeks when you have one of these assignments to do, be prepared to GRIND. The psets and midterm are a grind, which took me ~20 hours to do for each. The final project was not explained very well, so be prepared to put in A LOT of work for it. – Community. The class is like 70% grad students, so if you're in undergrad, you probably won't find many new friends with similar experiences in the class. The grad students are still chill on average, don't get me wrong, but don't expect this to have the same undergrad community as Chem 20/30 or 17/27.– Office hours and feedback. The TFs are pretty good on average, but their feedback can vary wildly based on who your TF is. In office hours, some TFs were overly gatekeep–y about the answers,  while others were much more clear and would tell you if you got the problem rightOverall, Chem 110 is a good class overall, but it has some quirks. I would still highly recommend the course if you have interest in therapeutics, since you will learn a lot, but just mindful of the class's weak points.",
      "My main gripe with Chem110 is that grading is very particular and MOE (software) assignments are long and vague. Pset and midterm questions are very vaguely worded so that you don't know what you are looking for. Office hours can be frustrating as the typical response is that MOE is glitchy and people may get variable results. To be honest, variable results is not fun to work with for a class homework assignment. Regrade requests are highly variable in outcome.The plus is that the course material (lectures) is good. Very relevant stuff. Take the course if you want to learn more about drug development, but prepare for some occasional disappointments.",

There are also short excursions to see the crystallography lab or do measurements at the Nocera lab, which were both fun.

      "CHEM 160 is definitely one of the most challenging courses I’ve taken in my undergrad due to the high level thinking that is required for quantum chemistry. Luckily, the class is led by two outstanding professors who truly have their student’s interests and well–being at heart. Both Suyang and Khaled stand out as being professors that truly value the student experience, which makes all the difference when it comes to upper level classes that are more complicated, as is the case with CHEM 160.Topics–wise, this class is definitely a LOT. To be honest, there are still some topics that I do not understand at all. However, Suyang and Khaled definitely do their best in spite of this, as with having countless Office Hour sessions where they’re willing to go above and beyond to help with comprehension and understanding. Unfortunately, quantum chemistry remains an extremely difficult concept, but the efforts by both Suyang and Khaled certainly make a difference.In terms of organization, CHEM 160 is very nice in the sense that you only have six total PSETs (the last one is optional though!) and a take–home final, as well as a group presentation. This makes CHEM 160 a relatively easier to balance course in terms of the work–load, although you certainly need to put in the time and effort to do well. As long as you don’t mind being challenged, CHEM 160 is a great upper level class to fulfill your requirements!",
      "It is conceptually very difficult but the concepts are also really intriguing and give you a lot of insight into how many instruments work",
      "This is a gem but you should still try to keep up with the material just because of how interesting it is. In terms of preparation I was a little scared because I hadn't taken physics or linear algebra but all you really need is a good grasp on basic calculus (you dont' really need linear algebra) and some physics (but not really, I took it at the same time as I took PS2) and it should be fine. The psets are not too hard and you only need to finish them every two weeks. The presentation was also not too bad, you just have to prepare it according to the rubric and that was it. The teaching staff is veryyy nice in helping with assignments so def go to OH. Prepare for the final, or at least prepare for it to be very long. It took me like 15+ hours but I think that was abnormal for this year"

It was a great class, and while most people in it were classics/adjacent to classics, I never felt out of place or like I couldn't contribute ideas for lack of requisite background knowledge.It's a fairly standard survey of ancient Greek history, from the Minoans to the Romans. The primary source readings are quite interesting and read surprisingly easy. You should read Herodotus and Thucydides for section; admittedly, the secondary scholarship readings are a bit of a bore. I did wish the course spent more time on the 4th century period between the Peloponnesian War and Philip's conquests. Prof. Kosmin is great. I think he struck the right balance in acknowledging, for better or worse, the influence Greece – or the ideal of Greece – has had, currently has, and will continue to have on Western society.",

      "This course was fantastic. Dr. Asraf is a fantastic teacher, and I think that he did an exceptional job teaching this course. The course balanced reading a fairly decent volume of original text material with grammar review and analysis. The reading pace is pretty perfect for strong students in Greek who are just beginning to read original texts but are ready to put in the work, and Nadav is excellent at reviewing/reteaching grammar as he goes through the text. The handouts were super helpful for key grammatical structures, and Dr. Asraf's skills and interests in linguistics shine through in his explanations. The class discussions were not just about grammar and syntax, but also the literary devices and poetic features of the language, and this was great. I felt I learned about the texts we read, as well as the literary and historical contexts our texts were situated in, and related texts (eg. Thesmophoriazusae). This course also provides a really useful introduction to Greek metre, with a focus on iambic trimeter. We definitely learned how tragedies are arranged metrically. But it is so much more than just an intermediate reading class, and is therefore not only interactive, but extremely engaging and interesting. I think that any undergrad Classics student would learn a lot from this class. The introduction to philological tools (eg. dictionaries, commentaries, apparatus criticus, scholia, grammar resources) was immensely helpful, and we also looked at secondary sources. Dr. Asraf grades extremely fairly.",

      "Greek 112A is not a course to be taken lightly. It is hard, far harder than other 100s level Greek courses I have taken. Compared to other language courses I've taken, it feels like drinking from a fire hose— a dizzying rush of different authors and dialects, and readings consistently 500+ lines a week in length. But while dizzying, it is never disorienting, and Professor Weiss' excellent teaching as well as the bevy of excellent commentaries and articles provided will insure that it is very much manageable, if rather difficult, to keep on top of this course. I would not take Greek 112A without thorough preparation (I would recommend prospective students first have taken and felt comfortable in at least one 100s level Greek course), nor if you are unwilling to put in the work for what will be a hard course, but if one is willing to face its challenges, Greek 112A offers proportionate rewards. You will be introduced to many of the greatest authors of Greek literature, given a crash course in their scholarship and language, and get the chance to engage with some of their greatest works in the original language. If you're anything like me, you will end the semester with a vastly improved understanding of Greek literary history and a much better handle on the language. Greek 112A makes you learn a lot and quickly, but if you're prepared stick with it, you will learn it and be much the better for it. No course at Harvard has ever taught me half as much as Greek 112A has. All in all, I would consider it quite simply the best course, or at least my favorite course, that I have ever taken here.",

Though the assignments can be difficult, Professor Riehle is an excellent teacher; his lectures are very clear and engaging, and he is also an incredibly kind person.  He answers emails promptly, encourages office hour meetings, and seems to genuinely care for each student.  Through his teaching, I went from being unable to read the most basic manuscript with solely uppercase Greek letters to some of the most elaborate manuscripts that I may not have never even recognized as Greek before taking this class.  Professor Riehle throws you headlong into the assignments from the start, which definitely requires a bit of a learning curve, but, even by the second week, the assignments begin to feel manageable.

      "This course covered  quite a lot of ground. Its breadth is one of its biggest strengths. We read from all 12 books of the Aeneid, and got quite a full sense of the work although we obviously didn't read all of it in Latin. Even though the weekly readings were quite long and we were not able to discuss them in their entirety in detail, this course teaches you to read carefully with an eye for the literary features of the work and to notice and close read the literary and metrical artistry of Virgil's poetry. Metre is also part of the course, and you will learn to scan. Your Latin reading skills and grasp on grammar will improve a lot.The class discussions were really fascinating, and incorporated a mixture of translating/reading particular sections in class, looking at the syntax and morphology of specific forms, and grammatical features of particular sentences that Professor Thomas highlighted, and broader discussion of the readings.  Intertextuality and intratextuality are major elements of this course, as intertextuality is a speciality of Professor Thomas'.  I really liked this, because I noticed I began to make connections across different authors and texts (not only within Homer and the epic genre, but across Latin authors and later literature and art that draws on the Aeneid), and read with an eye for the indications of potential inter/intratexts. Professor Thomas, it goes without saying, is extremely knowledgeable and an excellent professor. He is very reachable via email, and going to him with questions in office hours or outside of class was helpful. The TF for the course, Will, was brilliant. He provided amazing guidance about how to get the readings done, led a weekly section, and was great about answering questions. Be prepared for long readings, and regular quizzes. This is not the same as AP Latin or any Latin course in high school. The readings and quizzes felt challenging at the start. There is a midterm, a final, a paper, a presentation, and a recitation. The weekly quizzes, although a bit stressful, were useful, and the two exams were very fair in terms of the familiarity of their format and what they evaluated. Professor Thomas grades really fairly and he is quite understanding on the whole. I really recommend this course and enjoyed it a lot. Super worthwhile. Professor Thomas is fantastic.",
      "I think this class left me with a feeling of accomplishment from covering the whole Aeneid, but I found it disengaging. I was falling asleep at times during class, it seemed to be a lecture–style with only 12 or so students in class, etc. Also, the assignments really piled up in the week before exams, with many being due during reading week. This almost derailed my performance for other subjects' exams.",

I came into this class being able to translate, with difficulty, Caesar and Cicero and left being able to write in Latin in the style of Livy, Sallust, Apuleius, and various other Latin authors.  Professor Hudson gently guides the student in a carefully–thought–out course plan.  The course starts out with straight–forward exercises with fill–in–the–blanks, followed by exercises with longer Latin passages to translate.  These are then followed by exercises involving conversion from one author's style to another (e.g. change Cicero's Latin to Sallust's Latin), which then gives way finally to translating English passages into Latin in the style of a particular author.  This was all done so smoothly that I barely noticed a change from one week to another, but, looking back, I realize how far I have come from the start of the semester.  Professor Hudson is a very kind individual who seems to genuinely care for his students; he encourages students to sign up for office hours in addition to those listed on the syllabus and generally is eager to help in whatever way he can.

This class is a breath of fresh air and will reshape your own perspectives on literature and what a humanities class can be like (ex: more lecture–based versus usual seminar–based). Finnegans Wake is a very challenging text that will make you question at times if you can still read English, but Professor Hamilton does an incredible job breaking it down and making it accessible all while still leaving room for students to bring up new insight of their own—a wonderful combination that is no small feat. This class welcomes all concentrations and backgrounds, as each individual can contribute a unique perspective on this dynamic text. The weekly discussion posts are the ideal mix of minimizing stress while also maximizing deep analysis of the literature itself, and there is plenty of freedom to take the assignment to where you see fit and compelling. Despite how evocative Finnegans Wake is, Professor Hamilton's teaching is undoubtedly the highlight of the class, and he can make a 2–hour lecture fly by. His personal anecdotes and impressions are always something to look forward to as well.

      "It is because I adore Nabokov that I abhorred this class. I'm a senior in English, and this is easily one of the worst lit classes I've taken. Lecture was useless to anyone but the first–years who commandeered the discussion to fit their own needs. No, not the small discussion sections—the in–lecture fifty–person discussion that took up one of the two precious hours of lecture/week. Yes, the first hour of lecture was a hollow handful of \"big ideas;\" the second was asking students what they liked/disliked about the book. One might think that if every week one exclaims, \"I wish I had more time!\" at the end of the first hour, one might find \"more time\" in the second hour,  but then of course one might miss out on \"learning from one's students\" by barely facilitating a \"conversation\" (read: \"confusingly long queue of raised hands\"). This pedagogy is clearly inspired by Nabokov himself:\"The best method of teaching anything is to rely on discussion in class, which means letting twenty young blockheads and two cocky neurotics discuss for fifty minutes something that neither their teacher nor they know\" (Nabokov, Pnin Ch. 6).We were not promised a Nabokov expert, but we were promised a course appropriate for grad students and discussions that would \"benefit everyone.\" I'm all for inclusive enrollment, and I think everyone can have valuable input, but there is also a responsibility to respect all students' time and expectations. It is an insult to make a course essentially intro–level to meet inexperienced but vocal students, rather than encouraging them to find a more suitable class and come back next year. It would benefit those students as well to find someone who will actually encouragingly challenge rather than indiscriminately indulge their comments. Nabokov (esp. Lolita) is truly difficult to read, and some of the heavier/more complicated subject matters and literary concepts were handled with the grace of a panda—not because of the discussers' ideas or attitudes, but because our non–lecturer had simply failed to teach us how to discuss such things. No matter how earnest and hard–working some members of the crew are, when the captain leaves the helm for a nap, everyone on the ship goes down. On a positive note, the only lectures that truly balanced the novels, biography, history, philosophy, and intertextuality in an educational and engaging way were the two excellent guest lectures presented by the TFs. I learned so much about Russian/French lit from the materials my wonderful TF prepared for our sections. If the \"who\" and/or \"how\" of this course ever changes, please do take it—Nabokov's work is some of the cleverest, funniest, and most beautiful writing out there.",
      "The texts are amazing and you should read Nabokov at some point, so do it with a group! Definitely do the reading because you will be quizzed on tiny details, but if you read the books you will have no trouble acing the quizzes. The essays are low stakes, and I had one of my best humanities sections EVER in this course (Maria you are the best). The lecture is a little awkwardly formatted –– the discussion section can drag on –– but you can express your ideas to your heart's content.  Only take the class if you're actually going to read all of the novels.",

      "I would recommend this class! You get to learn a little bit about a lot of languages. You won’t go into too much depth on any one language, but it gives you a pretty solid foundation to continue learning if you want. This class has people with very different experience levels and backgrounds, but I think it does a pretty good job of catering to everyone.You can find all this information on the website, but basically you get assigned a section according to how you rate yourself from least comfortable to most comfortable with the material. Each week there are usually harder and easier versions of the pset, and you can choose which to do. If you do both you can keep the higher score. The default grading system for CS50 is Sat/unsat, but if you want to count it for a concentration that requires a letter grade you can switch to letter graded.The difficulty level and time commitment will depend a lot on what your experience with different programing languages is, if your taking the class graded, and if you go to office hours. For example, I only had experience with Java, so I was pretty relaxed during the first half of the course because c and python were pretty similar to Java. The website programming was a struggle for me though and I had to put in a lot more time to understand it.If you have a lot of CS experience you might want to think about going straight to CS61, but you can still learn a lot even if you have programming experience. For example, I did AP compsci and one class on data structures in high school, and for me it was definitely the right move to take CS50. You can just choose a more comfortable section and do the hard and easy programs for each pset.Starting early on the psets if you think you might run into problems is really helpful, because you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration by going to office hours! (There are sunday office hours in widener and smaller ones you can schedule with a TF) The CS50 debugger is honestly pretty confusing for me compared to something like eclipse, so for debugging you kind of just have to ask the ai duck or a TF.I thought this class was a fun experience, and it was a good way to meet people. There are lots of optional events like the puzzle day, hackathon, lunches, and CS50 fair.",
      "I would not recommend taking this class unless you want to hate CS or already know enough to not be frustrated. The lectures are extremely boring and dramatized because they post them online. The problem sets are also very frustrating to complete at times.",

      "I would recommend this class! You get to learn a little bit about a lot of languages. You won’t go into too much depth on any one language, but it gives you a pretty solid foundation to continue learning if you want. This class has people with very different experience levels and backgrounds, but I think it does a pretty good job of catering to everyone.You can find all this information on the website, but basically you get assigned a section according to how you rate yourself from least comfortable to most comfortable with the material. Each week there are usually harder and easier versions of the pset, and you can choose which to do. If you do both you can keep the higher score. The default grading system for CS50 is Sat/unsat, but if you want to count it for a concentration that requires a letter grade you can switch to letter graded.The difficulty level and time commitment will depend a lot on what your experience with different programing languages is, if your taking the class graded, and if you go to office hours.

      "THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE CS COURSE AT HARVARD BY FAR. Everyone I knew said this course was terrible and so miserable and difficult so I put it off until my senior fall to take it, but wow I don't know why it's gotten such bad reviews. Eddie is a PHENOMENAL lecturer. He is a genius coder and such a good teacher. He explains things so clearly and is always so helpful and willing to answer questions or rephrase. I love all of his pictures––he draws out the concepts for us which makes them so clear. If you go to lectures or watch them later, you have everything you need to complete the psets. The course notes online are so helpful and clearly laid out. The problem sets are so clearly laid out and so FUN. You have one pset every two weeks and they are so. much. fun! The first pset is about memory allocation and ik it sounds boring but it was so much fun!! The second pset we had to diffuse a BOMB?!?! How cool is that!! You feel like a cool hacker in a movie when you're doing it. All of the psets I had such a blast doing. YES it is going to take hours and hours and hours––BUT it is such a fun process. It is not too difficult––most of it you will be able to do on your own from the lectures and course website and when you get stuck the TFs are incredible and wednesday office hours with pizza are always such a blast. After taking so much theory courses (120 and 124), this course reminded me of the joy of coding again. It was genuinely such a fun time, you just get to solve fun little problem sets with your code and the staff and resources provide it make it challenging but so doable and so so enjoyable. I genuinely do not know why it gets so many bad reviews. I had such a blast. Have so so much fun taking it :) If you go to lectures and see the problem sets as fun puzzle games (don't start them too late or you will just be stressed and won't be able to enjoy them!), then I promise you will have such a great time.",
      "I really enjoyed this class, but I made the mistake of taking two hard classes at the same time. This course will teach you plenty about the underlying function of computers, but you get out of it what you put in. I learned the most by doing the problem sets and reading the course website.",

If this is you, and you are not a total newbie to coding, please take this class, I beg of you. I feel like for the past year, I've been feeling just–ok about everything that I've been studying, but this class sparked so much joy + added so much excitement and joy and wonder to my semester.

This takes time, both in terms of coding and implementing everything, as well as thinking about novel ideas. For me, this was a rewarding process, but I think I didn't fully understand how large of a time commitment this would be, so I was sometimes stressed and really had to dedicate my Sundays / Mondays to this class. The exact amount of time probably varies per person but I'd say 10 hours per week outside of class. But the cool part is you get a lot of very intriguing projects out of it! I would love sending my work to my roommates and friends because I was often very proud of what I made!! If you are doing technical recruiting, you could honestly also showcase some of these projects there. Critique is also amazing in this class. You need to know how to take criticism, but as long as you see it as a well–intentioned thing, your skills and work can get so much better.All in all, please take if you have the bandwidth!

      "CS1090a is an AMAZING course. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm to anyone interested. I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q–guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. Advantages of CS109a:0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students' learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students' understanding of the material.  1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. 2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi–weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time–consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10–20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi–weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast–paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don't look back!",
      "Pavlos is great and it's easy to tell that he cares a lot. It's also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job–skills wise if that's what you're going for.That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics–wise. This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn't reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us \"you guys did a great job\" as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you're on track or not in the course.My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare–tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take–home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms/assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF–ing, while student B ends up with an A– because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.",

There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi–weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time–consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10–20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi–weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast–paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don't look back!",
      "Pavlos is great and it's easy to tell that he cares a lot. It's also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job–skills wise if that's what you're going for.That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics–wise. This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn't reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us \"you guys did a great job\" as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you're on track or not in the course.My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare–tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take–home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms/assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF–ing, while student B ends up with an A– because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.",

      "Overall I think this is a very nice course! I will note I came in with what I would call substantial mathematical maturity (I took math25). I think the course would be harder to approach for someone that's just learning proof structures like induction, contraposition, contradiction. For the rising sophomores looking to take the class, I would suggest going over some of these basic proof techniques that you might have learned in your cs20/similar background. Having some grasp of these ideas will help you tremendously.I don't think the proofs in the course require a great deal of cleverness or insight, especially not on exams. I would study the course content and I think if you know the course content you will be fine. The exams I believe were fair and of moderate difficulty level. As long as you study and prepare I think you will be fine. I would suggest doing the psets on your own at first and really thinking through the problems, but having a good pset group can be really helpful too. And I met some really cool people through cs120 that I really bonded with! I think the course overall does a great job of attempting to build community, though I sort of stumbled on my new friends by happenstance. Either way, I'm grateful to have found cool people to pset with and to have made new friends. Be open to meeting some cool new people through cs120! It'll make your life in the course a lot more fun. Don't be a stereotypical antisocial CS kid – even if you can do the psets on your own without any help, I suggest interacting with other people. Talking through and explaining ideas in the class are good ways to build in some early prep that pays off at exam time.The SREs are really not that painful, and some of them are quite enjoyable. Just set your alarm and make sure you get on that SEC shuttle. Having the one drop is pretty nice and gives a little bit of leeway.I think Salil is a really good lecturer. He explains things clearly and is really likable and personable. And he's even active on Ed sometimes! (Which tends to be a rarity among really senior professors. I appreciate him being down to earth like that.)I think Anurag is an amazing person and professor too, though I think by virtue of being so prolific in CS as a researcher he might have forgotten what it's like to learn these concepts for the first time and I wish he might emphasize different aspects of the content when lecturing. He had a tendency to linger for quite some time on really simple stuff that students get quickly and gloss over concepts that he seemed to regard as trivial but were actually quite subtle details worth spending some time on.One of our head TFs in the course Maxwell was truly phenomenal! I really appreciated his review sessions for the midterm and final, and I think they were very much worth going to, at least until they diverged into kind of trivial questions by students that were just really confused (this is not at all the fault of Maxwell). I do hope that future iterations of the course will be lucky enough to have a TF willing to take on conducting quality review sessions. If this is the case, I absolutely recommend making use of that resource.Honestly I don't think I ever went to section. It's there if you want it, and I heard from friends that a lot of them were really excellent. Section just isn't how I prefer to learn. Reading the lecture notes is great review though, as they are really high quality. Office hours were good, though oftentimes very crowded. Sometimes the TFs seemed to not quite grasp the pset entirely or lead students astray, but generally I think they were as good as can reasonably be expected and I really appreciate all their effort. Honestly I don't think the course is so terribly difficult that you need to be at office hours trying to farm everything, and you really do yourself a disservice come exam time if you don't try to independently think through the problems. Think for yourself (you learn more that way), and get yourself a nice group of friends (see above) in the class. Again, meet new people!Grading wise: I don't think it was that hard to earn R+'s on the psets, but you do need to be mathematically rigorous to an extent (see above again). For the participation, really just write in depth responses and you can score some R+'s. Honestly I am a little concerned about how they will draw final grades especially between A and A– grades. I would be careful and try to do your best especially on the exams. I think most students, especially with all the revisions allowed, get really high pset scores, so the exams seem to be the primary way they differentiate amongst students which is a bit stressful. I do wish they were more transparent about the +/– modifiers and what exam performance correlates and more detail about the grade distribution.Overall though a great course. I think you get a lot about elegance in computer science theory and learn to appreciate the more theoretical side of algorithms. Some of the content can be really beautiful. Honestly all things considered I am glad I took the class. Thanks to the professors and TFs for a great semester!",
      "Read the lecture notes thoroughly. Lectures themselves are helpful for digesting a higher level understanding of the concepts but you will only really master the material if you know the lecture notes inside out. Also, you should attempt problem sets alone as this will force you to really understand the material. Finally, there is initially a bit of an adjustment to the rigor demanded by the problem sets. Whilst there is a bit of a struggle earlier on in the semester, with practice you get a lot faster and better at formalizing explanations and so if you stick at it  by the end of the semester you will be able to type up proofs with ease.",

      "This course often gets a bad wrap, but I believe that it's both valuable to a well–rounded CS education and a phenomenally structured and organized class. It is harder than 120, and slightly more time consuming, but it's a lot more interesting and advanced (in my opinion), and will likely prepare you better for 124 if you haven't taken it already. Furthermore, a lot of the theory that you learn is pretty applicable to industry CS, and is especially helpful for things such as time and space complexity. The course also has a ton of great resources, with organized lectures and lecture notes, wonderful sections which recap the topics learned during the week, and a very good textbook which clarifies most of the lecture material. If you attend/watch lectures, go to section, and read the textbook, you'll do more than fine in the class. By just doing those three things, I was very prepared for both midterms, and didn't have to do much studying outside of making a notes sheet. The TFs are all great, and they are super fair graders. The psets took around 8 hours per pset, but I felt that most of the problems were doable without going to office hours, but even when I had to, they were never very busy. Adam is also a super kind and caring person, and he wants you to succeed in the class.",

      "You should definitely take this class! It was quite different from any other CS class I have taken here, and expanded my brain in cool ways. One regret I have is that I was also taking a 9 am on T/Th at the same time, which meant I couldn't attend the law–only classes with martha, but I wish I could have!One tip I will give for this class is to go to Office Hours, especially the ones with Cynthia!! It is absolutely amazing how available she makes herself to students if you seek her out. She hosts office hours every week, and she also hosted office hours every day leading up to the final. The class is small too so if you go, she will have ample time to talk to you 1:1, about class content or about any other topic related to research, work, or life that you might have.I will say though that this class can be a bit stressful at times, to the point that I would ask myself why I was even taking it in the first place. I think this stems from the problem sets being really long, confusing, and disorganized, and the office hours being few and far in between. With this said though the grading is pretty generous, so you will probably be fine grade wise, but just keep this in mind. Also I would start the problem sets kind of late, and then there would only be one Office hour left so maybe this was on me. You will definitely want a problem set group though to bounce ideas off of, because the problems are creative and don't directly stem from the lectures all the time. Honestly, if you are on top of your work it is probably not too bad, and definitely worth the effort. I would also recommend doing the readings, or at least skimming them, since it is pretty expected that you do this, and can be helpful for homeworks and discussions. Regardless of the amount of temporary stress close to problem set deadlines, I am glad I took this class.Harvard is truly a hotbed of academic research related to differential privacy, cryptography, and increasing fairness, so it is a quintessential class to take if you are interested in theory, or interested in TechxSociety. I wish I had taken this class (or one of Salil's) as a junior so that I could have gotten involved in research at OpenDP during college itself. Prof. Dwork is truly so knowledgeable and a female icon in CS, so taking a class with her was on my bucket list for college. Sometimes you must pinch yourself when you realize you are taking a class with the person who literally invented the field covered.As an additional note, I really hope that they include a discussion section for future offerings –– I think this live reinforcement of the content would greatly improve student understanding. As far as what prep you need before hand, I think that having a strong background in just reading math is pretty important. I also think having good statistics intuition (maybe from taking Stat 110 / Stat 111 or maybe CS181) would be helpful, and well as having taking CS120/124 or a similar theoretic CS sequence. None of this is necessarily required, and you can definitely put in more work to stay on top of everything in the class, but just having familiar with notation or basic concepts is helpful because the class does go by fast.",
      "This was one of the most frustrating classes I've taken during my time at Harvard. CS component: Although the opportunity to learn about algorithmic fairness, differential privacy, etc. from one of the literal inventors of the fields is certainly amazing, Prof. Dwork's lectures could be quite dense and hard to follow. I found her notation unnecessarily confusing, and I feel she could have done a better job motivating a lot of the technical concepts we covered. Prof. Dwork herself is quite considerate, though, and obviously a genius, so the opportunity to talk to her at her \"I'm lost\" office hours was very helpful. In terms of assignments: problem sets felt unnecessarily long at times (some questions involved writing paragraphs–long responses to vague questions that didn't really improve our understanding of the course material), and unnecessarily difficult at others (tricky questions pulled from papers, which weren't related to what was discussed in lecture). Attendance at office hours felt necessary to score close to 100% on problem sets, due to ambiguities or technicalities in the problem set questions. At the same time, office hours were often unhelpful, as TFs had no better idea of how to answer certain questions than students did. Very few comments were provided on problem set submissions. We didn't even receive official solutions against which to check our own work.The final exam felt quite unreasonable; even though we were given 4 hours (more than the 3 hours that FAS budgeted for), no one finished. Joint component: This component was honestly the most disappointing one of the entire course. I've taken a few classes on similar material before (intersection of tech and law), and I felt that that nothing new was really presented in CS1260. If you're interested in these topics, you probably won't gain very much from the joint component of this course. I was quite disappointed in how surface–level the discussions in the joint classes often were. Although the readings were interesting, we rarely engaged with them in class discussion; it felt like most of the comments being made were by students who were encountering the material for the very first time. Discussions were also often dominated by law students, who I felt focused too much on their own experiences than on thoughtfully commenting on the questions on the table. Finally, the two joint class group assignments were among the most infuriating assignments of my life. The prompts felt vague and not extremely meaningful. And I was quite disappointed by the failure of the law students in my group to contribute constructive insights about the legal considerations being discussed.",

      "This is an interesting, but difficult class. As a CS concentrator, it felt very grounding to understand the lower level of the stack (circuits, combinational logic, processors, chips, semis). After taking this course, I am much more appreciative (& in awe) of the innovation that goes on at the hardware level on processors (CPUs/GPUs) and memory devices (SRAM/DRAM/FLASH). Computer architecture isn't very mathy or theory based, which is nice. It's very visual and spatial–reasoning heavy. So if you like puzzles or are more of a visual thinker, the concepts won't be that difficult to understand.It is a fair amount of work with the weekly PSETs and FBGA labs, but doable. The textbook is actually really well–written, and they encourage you to use AI to help you through the materials. PSETs + labs would easily take 2–5x longer if you don't use any AI.Lectures can be very dense, but Woody is one of the best STEM lecturers I've had at Harvard. It's very refreshing to see in the CS department, in which most lectures are not worth attending. He is clearly passionate and extremely knowledgable about the topic, and often relates course material back to the real world drama of the semiconductor industry.Really glad I took this course.",

This puts it easily in first place followed by CS61, CS124, and Stat 111 at 193, 180, 172 hours total. In all cases, these times including _everything_ done for the class. Suffice it to say, this class has a HEAVY workload. If I had attempted more of the extra credit and interesting add–ons to the project, I would have easily been able to put in 300+ hours into this class. So, the usual warnings of time management apply here. You might notice that I put in almost no time in the first third of the course. This was, in my opinion, a massive mistake.In the beginning, you will start with a handout code of a couple hundred lines. However, by the end, you will end up writing 6000+ lines of code. In my case, I ended up writing 9979 lines of .c and .h code. Of course there are empty and comment lines included in that, but you see my point. As such, code organization will be very important. For example, your project will need code to parse and execute various database operators. How will you do this? Perhaps consider putting each operator into its own file such as parse_select.c and execute_select.c as an example. Similarly, there will need to be thought put into the load and print commands whose execution will require logic dissimilar than the other operators. How will you deal with cases where you need to find a specific result column from its handle? How about when you need to find a database column from its full name? how about finding the specific entry in the client context for a relevant search? How will you handle database persistance? Where will code for btree and sorted index creation go? In the file with execute_create? maybe a separate create_index.c file? Where will the functions doing the search within the indices go? There is just simply a lot of code to be written. Think about semantic ways of separating your code into different files. If not, your files such as db_manager, parse and execute will baloon to thousands of lines. If using vscode, things like ctrl shift o, ctrl p, and various vim–esque keyboard shortcuts will be increase your productivity. The lectures were very dissimilar to other lecture–style CS classes I took. I was with a great cohort of students and we tried our best to ask so so many questions. We questioned everything and Stratos was great and he encouraged us in that. I think this class wins the award for the most knowledge learnt through slides per word on the slides :D To the point and keeps the focus on the conversation we are having with Stratos. CS165 has the most generous course policies of any course. I want to thus go into a tangent on the many many generosities shown by the class. Both exams are take–home and start at 9AM and last until 12pm the next day. It is open book, open computer, open internet, AND, most importantly, open people! You are able to talk through the problems with others taking the class! Of course your writeup needs to be done separately, but this is the kind of confidence they have in their problems and in their teaching philosophy. I learned so much from the back–and–forth discussions we had when trying to come up with the best algorithm for a task. How is it that the Midterm _taught_ me something? Incredible. The class has almost no deadlines. There is a midway check–in mid october by which you need to pass the first 3 of the 59 tests. This is to give you a sense of the gigantic scope of this project compared to any other class you have ever taken. Beyond that, there is only one deadline, the final one. Essentially, the course trusts you completely and leaves almost everything to you. You make any kind of design decisions. The midterms were fine. There is extra credit galore in each midterm and your first midterm doesn't count if you do better on your second. Nothing to worry about. ezpz. I highly suggest using Ubuntu/Linux for developing this project. You will be directly developing in the OS that your testing server will use. You will also be able to compile and run natively without worrying about cstdlib functions not being present on mac or windows. Please god please don't use windows.  `gdb` is essential for this project. Specifically, learn how to create a .gdbinit file and create various layouts which will come in handy. A particularly useful layout for me was `tui new–layout <layout_name> {–horizontal src 3} 2 cmd 1`. You can switch to this layout using `layout <layout_name>`. Learn also how to use vgdb to use gdb together with valgrind for a powerful duo. I heavily suggest using tmux as a terminal multiplexer. Learning it and setting it up as I like is has been an absolute game changer. For example, I didn't do this myself and it cost me dear time at the end: create a test execution script that can start the server and client processes as well as can input specific tests into the client. Use the test generation scripts to create tests of different magnitudes. You should at least create the 10million row version of the tests. Then, develop your project only using the larger tests. I personally always used a 1million row dataset and its tests. It served me very well. 10 million is for the stress tests. For example, did you know that there is a max limit size of a stack allocated array? This means any stack allocated array should make sure it doesn't go past that size. This is very niche: the course uses C99 but C99 does not have a address aligned malloc function. HOWEVER, you can create one yourself if you would like. The way you do this can be found on the internet, but what this allowes you to do is to assume almost every memory region you allocated is cache/page aligned. How about that :DSome Areas that the course could improve upon: 1– The CS165 language needs to be updated. For example, there are tests that require single–threaded execution. Thus, there is a single_core() and single_core_execute() command that essentially enable and disable multicode performance. Very easy to implement, however, it must be included in the language regardless. 2– Certain things about the project need to be clarified. For example, it is possible for certain tests to create an internal variable, say s1, and then overwrite it with a new result also named s1. However, at least from my look at the project, there is no text on whether this is allowed. 3– The create column command specification is `create(col,<col_name>,<tbl_var>)` however, the examples shown just below it show examples such as `create(col,\"project\",awesomebase.grades,unsorted)`. However, this `unsorted` argument is not allowed given the language. These kinds of inconsistencies need to be resolved and not left to be clarified every year using Ed. 4– Many students including me experience issues with permissions and with the docker container running as root. This is extremely unnecessary and dangerous I believe. If the docker container has any issues, it will execute with root access. My docker container should not be able to nuke my computer :D I mean this is an exageration, but there is no reason to not have a basic user such as `cs165–student`. This would remove a lot of issues with root permissions. For example, after every time I used run_mile with the make file, it compiles the project with the docker root user. Thus, I need to then run a `sudo` make clean instead of just being to use my normal user. I needed to use sudo so much and I find that this is not good practice and makes it so unnecessary. I had input mu 25 char password every time I needed to do this. I seriously considered reducing my computer's password length or removing it entirely to stop password authentication every single time I needed to compile my code after a run_mile. 5– Some of the section recordings are extremely old and the audio and video quality is really showing its age. I would humbly that the class invest some TF time to rerecord these videos with hopefully better production. 6– Certain things mentioned in the milestone requirements turned out to be optional and worth extra credit point. The course needs to clarify what counts as a minimum and what not. For example, I later in the course learned that there would be no inserts done after index creation. This meant that I could make many assumptions about my structure. This lead me to design a –I think– novel way to store the btree in memory without needing a reference to each node's start address. I literally halved my btree size and made it perform much better in terms of cache locality. Final thoughts:There is so much to say about this class, but just know that this class really cares about your success. There were office hours and help available almost every single day. What can I say, I feel that I didn't make the most of this class and I could have done so much more for this class. I am definitely going to implement the project in Rust at some point:D I wish you luck. If class difficulty is not an immediate no for you, then class will deliver. Take the plunge and learn how one can learn so much in just a semester. Like, the largest project I had worked on before this has 2800 lines of python code. Of course, c gets way less done in the same number of lines, but still, this was a big personal achievement for me to have finished this. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world...",

      "Here's my honest guide to Reinforcement Learning :)[Prereqs]:STAT 110 I think is a must with its statistical knowledge.Linear Algebra and Multivariate are also highly encouraged so you understand the math.I don't really think any other CS course is needed, just know how to program in Python.[Overall]:If you want to really understand the field of RL, this class does it so well.  The math is challenging but the class never felt overly–difficult because you had a lot of resources with office hours, recaps in lecture, and sections. The class leading up to the midterm is the more \"harder\" part in that the midterm is written.  Please study for it, it basically determines the variability in grades in the class.  The post–midterm part of the class' material gets more challenging but you get to do a project and I absolutely love projects because you can deep–dive into a part of RL that you like on a topic you love, so it becomes less hard.[Problem Sets]:Pretty average problem sets with written/proof parts and programming parts.  Programming isn't bad at all, it's just writing in code what you learned in class in Python. – There were 4 problem sets when I took this course– The hardest is the 1st and as you go they decrease in length and difficulty– Basically just go to 1–3 office hours and you'll be totally fine.[Lectures]:The amount of material you cover is a bit insane but to me that's worth it because it's a bang for your buck.  The Professor is very passionate about the work.  What I recommend doing:– Don't try to jot down everything/scramble.  Instead, understand the intuition while the professor is talking and pointing to things on the slides.  The lectures are recorded and there's already so much math on the screen it's better to understand the main points and write those down than to get bugged in the details.  You can do that later offline.– Have on the side, and especially before the midterm, a \"summary\" note sheet you make as you go along.  It's so useful to do a recap yourself, beyond the recaps the professor does before each and every lecture.[Topics Covered]:Basically the idea of RL is there's an agent and the agent is trying some actions out in its environment, which may/may not change the environment they're in.  The agent has some goal in mind.  The following topics focus on either specific applications/environment setups or ways to help the agent to interact with their environment.– Markov Decision Processes in finite and infinite cases: given some states the environment can be in and some actions the agent can perform, what state and action sequence gives the agent the best reward?– Control: this topic focuses on \"controlling\" or \"balancing\" within a physical environment. how can I get an agent to learn to overcome physical forces?  For example, how do I balance a long pole on a moving cart?– Bandits: given a selection of choices (think a casino slot–machine) with outcomes I don't know, what's the best way to learn so I maximize my reward now AND in the future?  This topic looks at exploration vs exploration of choice.– Learning: all about supervised learning– PG: basically, how volatile are we in getting to the best outcome?  Can we reduce variance in the steps we take to get to the outcome?  We cover things like TRPO, NPG, and PPO.– Miscellaneous: Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning: can we start our agent off by \"learning from another agent\"?",
      "Probably one of the worst courses I have taken, despite the very positive Q–reports it had. The lectures were not engaging in the slightest, there is a focus on statistical proofs rather than any fundamental of reinforcement knowledge, and proofs are taught on slides with details very quickly skipped over, but the expectation that students know them for assessment. You will likely only learn through the final project or potentially the coding portion of the problem sets. The assignment expectations are not clearly communicated and the midterm expectations are not reasonable. Additionally, during the midterm there was constant talking by the professor which disturbed any students who work in silence. On the other hand, there are only 4 assignments, a midterm and a final project so it is not a very heavy course. The OHs are lifesavers in terms of problem sets. Do not recommend this course unless the structure is changed.",

      "If you are at all interested in machine learning and NLP, take this class. It's a little rough around the edges; questions go unanswered, assignments go ungraded, and no one ever really knows what's going on. With that said, however, professor Shieber is an EXCELLENT source of knowledge and is always more than happy to discuss his work and philosophy. There really is a lot to learn from this class. For those completely new to ML, you'll walk away with a pretty strong grasp of PyTorch and the resources and skills to start building and training your own models. For those interested in NLP, you'll touch on every single part of the language model pipeline and walk away implementing your very own sequence to sequence model from scratch. Additionally, you'll learn a lot about formal language theory. While this language is less broadly applicable to ML, it is still interesting stuff especially if you're into linguistics at all. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. If you're willing to spend the time and work past this courses flaws, you'll find this class really is wonderful. On top of that, work outside of class is definitely a lot less than a standard upper level CS class, which is very nice.",
      "Really wouldn't recommend this class. It sounds interesting on paper, and the first few weeks are okay, but the middle/end was a waste of time.

      "This class had a couple real gems in lectures, but could overall use some improvement. CONTENTThe course covered a wide variety of topics in training foundation models. In particular, it began with basic backprop + gradient descent, edge of stability, optimization techniques and theory, sharding, training pipeline (pre/mid/post), parallelization, generative AI, inference, with interspersed topics taught by guest lectures: Jonathan Frankle (databricks), Roy Frostig (jax), Julia Neagu / Deanna Emery (QuotientAI), Vahan Petrosyan / Leo Linden (SuperAnnotate), and Jacob Austin (Google Deepmind). The main instructors for the content were Sham and various Kempner postdocs. The material is largely interesting, but not very organized.  Some of the lectures were quite interesting, for instance Frankle discussed some relatively original takes; the first two lectures had some intriguing theoretical content, etc. However, several lectures depend critically on familiarity; for instance, I think it is very difficult to take anything out of a jax lecture if one has not worked with the language before. For many lectures, without references or implementation exercises, it was difficult to take something concrete; for instance, in either the parallelization lectures or the generative AI lectures (both of which were interesting, but some exercises would have been nice). Overall, a fun class to take which is low–workload and is essentially a sequence of seminar talks, and not necessarily an organized and very rigorous course.HWThere were three HWs which constituted two of Sasha Rush’s puzzles (available publicly on GitHub). This caused the class to be very easy in terms of workload; however, I wish there were HW assignments which more accurately described the content. For instance, it would have been nice to actually train a model using parallel compute, actually implement some of the optimization techniques, use JAX, implement generative models (e.g. diffusion, etc.). PROJECTThere is a project at the end of the course. This project is pretty open–ended and is a good opportunity for students to engage in some original work in ML, and I appreciate it as the only major assignment of the course. There are a few milestones where we received decent feedback. Again, I think it would have been nice for there to be some starting guidelines, possibly in the HW assignments, for places to start; generating ideas was an interesting but relatively nontrivial process.",

      "A thoroughly enjoyable class. HT is a great professor, and it is a real honor to be able to learn from a man with such deep, encyclopedic knowledge of the field. The material is also simultaneously incredibly broad and deep (there's just a lot of it!), and I've really come away feeling like I've learned a lot about systems and efficient ML more generally.The PSETs were very manageable, the midterm was not that bad, and the quizzes were annoying and tedious but they only lasted for the first half of the class. Definitely a pretty tough class, but it's all so worth it.The final project is really interesting: the constant feedback from HT makes it unusual in that you are guaranteed to have something good, that you can be proud of by the end, but it is also the highest expectation I've ever seen for a final project at this university (not like, a PhD thesis like i saw a previous comment say, but definitely non–trivial and you need good, novel results, which are not always easy to come by).HT is also the greatest PowerPoint user I've ever seen, his slides are fantastic and unlike any other prof's.Sit in the front row to be able to follow lecture closely, do not give into the temptation to pull your laptop out when you get confused, and interact with the staff as much as you can, it's just uniformly good for you to do so.A great way to knock out the systems requirement at the undergrad or AB/SM level. 10/10 would recommend and take again.",
      "I do not recommend this course, and I say this as someone who was very excited to take it and was interested in this line of research. There are too many issues, and even the opportunity to learn from such a professor as Prof HTK does not make up for it. – You cannot hear him during lecture. He does not speak clearly, though this may not be his fault but rather a technical issue with the microphone. Either way you will go to class and hear something very garbled and the recording is even worse. You quite literally can hear nothing unless you sit right in front of the professor. He is brilliant but this is a problem that I feel should be fixed; he is capable of speaking clearly because he does every 30 minutes or so for one or two sentences and then you cannot hear anything again. – The course staff who are hired to answer your questions seem to not like it when you ask them questions. If you ask them about specifics for the coding assignments, the people I asked said they didn’t know. I wondered how they did not know but that was irrelevant because no matter the reason, I did not receive help and was slightly screwed. – The quizzes are ridiculous. The questions themselves are not crazy, but the time limit of 12 minutes for 10 questions seems to be something unrealistic — as if you ask the TF about a question sometimes they take 3–4 mins to think of an answer, so how are we supposed to do the same in 1–2mins as people who are seeing the content for the first time?– Every assignment with the exception of the first will be in a group. This group may not be people you know, and even if it is, you will come to learn just how lazy and unresponsive some of your peers can be. I would in general for CS avoid group based assignment classes if you can.– The final exam requires that you remember exact things from the lecture slides, sometimes useless details. For example, they test you on a concept where there are multiple possible parameters, but instead of quizzing actual understanding they ask about what exact values for the parameters were used in class. There is a special circumstance in which i recommend you take this course1) You are actually willing to read the papers in detail and are deeply interested in hardware and software AI acceleration techniques2) You have an idea before going in of possible projects you might want to pursue 3) You are going to ask questions in class and the course staff will like you if you ask intelligent research–like questions but not really about HW4) You will be a good team member, and you are willing to pick up the slack for the slackers who are not.",

      "This class teaches you all about the cutting edge work done in improving computer networking for machine learning. Before this class, I always hesitated to get into the weeds with ML systems, but now after this class I feel comfortable with the workings behind many of the popular pipelining, training, and serving frameworks and how they are motivated/work. You get exposed to lots of material, covering everything starting from parallelisms and then branching off into a number of topics such as scheduling, congestion, fault tolerance, and deployed systems in the real world, etc. The course gave me more confidence in how real world systems work, what the problems are that need to be solved, and made me appreciate the overall hardness of the field. Each paper seemed practically relevant and asked interesting questions. The course makes you read through the papers and really question what makes a paper good or bad, not taking its contents for granted. I learned so much about analyzing figures and understanding where the bottlenecks are, whether the experiments are answering the right questions, and whether the experiments are even answering the question they supposedly answer. The professor is full of insights, and is fantastic at fostering discussions with incisive questions that test deep understanding. The structure of the course is perfect.",

      "If you're interested in systems security, this class is definitely for you! Mickens is a wonderful lecturer, the 3 projects were very fun to do, they're challenging enough to be interesting, but at the same time definitely doable (I didn't feel the need to go to office hours at all). The late policy is definitely harsh, but you're given at least 2 weeks for every project (and in my experience, a project took no more than 2 days to finish, but this definitely depends on programming experience). The readings were consistently interesting to do. The class was still lecture–style so you don't really discuss the papers, but you still submit some observation/questions you have about the reading assignment before every class. Regarding exams: Mickens has a very distinct exam style that focuses on more conceptual questions (which is very different from the usual exam style in CS 61). On this end, I just wished there would be practice exams, but there weren't any that I could find. For exam preparation, I recommend rewatching lectures and ensuring you feel confident on the topics. There's a final project component that you do within groups of 2–3 people, and the difficulty of the project really depends on the topic you select. Overall, I highly recommend this class, but definitely be mentally prepared – it's very non trivial.",

      "This was overall a very informative course in interpretable ML. I think it's also a good opportunity to practice the ML research process through the course project (for context, I am an undergrad).Strengths of the class: The project checkpoints provide a lot of opportunity to get feedback and input, so there really aren't a lot of surprises when you turn in your project. I think this was a really well done part of the course, and Finale did a great job giving feedback. Class presentations where you could get feedback on your project were nice, though I question how engaged many students in the course were during these presentations and ultimately I'm unsure of the quality of feedback I got from peers, but this is less a criticism of the course/course staff and more just a reality of student attention in project presentations. The depth of discussion in the course I think was really impressive especially considering the size of the class. The course staff did a great job of trying to get people interested and engaged in discussion, and during the paper discussions I think people were really engaged and had a lot of good ideas. I learned a lot from the discussion part of the course. I personally think Finale is a good lecturer/presenter as well, provides excellent feedback and steering on the projects in office hours, and is detail oriented, precise, and thoughtful.Weaknesses: I'm unsure how important some of the interpretability methods covered in the course will continue to be as models get larger and more complex, like foundation models. Specifically, I would have liked to see more content in the course on mechanistic approaches to interpretability beyond one class. Also, though it is impressive that Finale (1) kept the course enrollment uncapped and (2) managed to at least simulate a close knit discussion environment in such a large course, it is unavoidable that when a course is this big it's not the same as a small little seminar, so I would keep this in mind. One suggestion for the course staff is to implement an Ed discussion board, where people can ask questions about the content, homework assignments, readings, projects, course logistics, etc. I think a lot of courses benefit from this and do a really good job of it, and I know it is a burden on the course staff, but I think this would be a really good thing to do and frankly I was disappointed that this is one of the first CS courses I've taken without an Ed discussion board. In terms of workload and grading: Finale said herself at the start of the semester this is a pretty chill class, and I wholeheartedly agree. I think you get out what you put into it though, and you want to focus on doing a really good project and not letting all that work catch up to you during reading period. I think they could have been more transparent in terms of grading at the onset – there was an announcement about how grades would go down toward the end of the course, and I think it would have been better to say that at the start. I think for a graduate course the grading scheme they claimed they would use was harsher than I would have expected going in, as they said A and B range grades, though the project feedback is designed to get you in that A/A–/B+ territory, but really most graduate courses in CS have a grade distribution much more generous than this if they're really handing down B+'s. In the end though I think the grading was fair and reasonable and I wouldn't be intimidated by the course workload or grading at all, but do put in effort especially into the project, and really the more you engage in discussion and the course content the more you'll get from the course.",

This class covers a wide variety of topics, from linear algebra basics to projective geometry to signal processing and so forth, but it by no means requires you to be an expert in any of them.  Overall, if you're looking for a low–work gem, don't take this class, but if you're  looking to learn a lot about computer vision (a REALLY interesting topic) from a variety of perspectives, I couldn't recommend it enough!"

While I'm not sure how this semester differed from previous semesters, I will say––for this semester, the class ran very smoothly, all according to schedule, and every assignment and lecture was very organized. The survey topics and guest lectures were very interesting, and I appreciated the extra support and emphasis given to the final project.Additionally, I learned that \"AI for Social Impact\" isn't just a chain of buzzwords. An interesting thing to note is that part of Milind's work is in advocating for this application–heavy subfield to be recognized with as much respect and prestige as other types of publications (such as methodology papers). In other words, while some conferences may not view application–heavy papers (such as using AI for conservation) in the same light as a new method for training an LLM, Milind is trying to change that by advocating for recognition of \"AI for Social Impact\" in academia. Super cool effort, and makes you think about how academia drives innovation as a whole––very much recommend!",

      "If you’re seeing this message, this is a sign for you to enroll in EPS 10. Hands down the best, most fascinating class I’ve taken at Harvard. I switched into EPS 10 four weeks into the semester, and looking back it was one of the best decisions I’ve made here. This class is one of those classes where you already know that it’s going to be one of the highlights of your Harvard experience. There are a lot of reasons why you should take this class, here are a few:– The content is so interesting. EPS 10 is an introductory course meant to provide an overview of Earth’s history, and it does exactly that. You learn about a range of things, from the start of the solar system and how Earth got its moon, to Earth’s early climate and its bleak history of mass extinctions.– The content is taught really well. Professor Fisher is great: she goes into detail about topics during her lecture, but you’re only expected to know things on a fundamental level. She’s great at answering questions, and explains things so well during lectures.–  Labs are also really fun and interactive. We got to study rocks, look at real pieces of asteroid from outer space, and simulate planetary collisions at the Viz Lab. There were also really cool visits to Harvard museums.– We went on a FIELD TRIP to look at ROCKS and DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS. Need I say any more?– The TFs are great. They know so much about Earth and love to answer questions. I used to go to office hours just to yap about Earth’s early climate and planets and stuff. I was in Val’s section and would recommend it to anyone enrolling in the class if she’s still around.To summarize, EPS 10 is a great example of a well–taught Harvard class. If you’re looking for an interesting elective, or to meet the STEM distributional requirement, this is the class to take!",
      "Highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to be tortured by boring lectures and an uncooperative professor!",
      "This class is much harder than previous course reviews makes it seem. The exams are largely not curved and quite difficult, but while there aren't many structured resources you can use to review the content (or even any indication of what will be on the exam), the key to doing well is showing up and taking notes on everything, whether it be lectures or labs or OHs. A surprising amount of questions on the exam were from a single slide of a single lecture, and the slides aren't posted in their full format, so you absolutely have to show up and pay attention to every lecture. The labs are also very relevant to the exams and matter a lot for your grade. Make sure to go to office hours to check your answers and get clarification on the mechanisms for each answer, since 1. they will enthusiastically take off points and 2. you will probably have to explain some of those mechanisms on the exam. For the final, you absolutely must show up to any and all review sessions hosted. I had good attendance in lab and lecture and I still learned probably 2/3 of the exam content from the review sessions alone. The class itself is really interesting and covers a lot of content, from the formation of our solar system to various extreme events throughout Earth's history (like mass extinctions and Snowball Earth) to the effects of tectonics on our climate. The first quarter was very rock–heavy, which I wasn't expecting (rock identification is quite tricky and difficult to study), but the second quarter focused more on the bigger topics of our history such as extreme climate events. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the material and more importantly if you are willing to dedicate your time and efforts into this class rather than treating it like a traditional gem. All of the TFs, as well as the professor, are engaged in really interesting work outside of, but related to, this class and they are so fun to talk to and exposed me to so many different areas of study that I didn't even know existed."

      "The strengths of this course was its hands–on learning during Friday labs and dissecting mineral composition data for our final projects. A clear highlight is the trip to Norway. I am a person who learns a lot more when I am actively engaged, and I would say I learned so much more during the trip than what I learned in lecture. Even though Stein is knowledgable about the subject, his presentation and delivery of lecture materials leave much more to be desired. He has an extremely dry teaching style. He is very monotonous and that's because he is mostly reading off of his incredibly text dense slides. These slides are useful and are really big resources, but it is not good for presentation. If you want a class that will keep you engaged, this is not the one. If you want to learn more about minerals and petrology, I would recommend other EPS classes. Psets are tedious with excel but not difficult. They feel unrelated to lecture material, but they help us learn skills/calculations that may be useful in practice. The lab is fun because you get to look at cool rocks.",

He is so kind to his students and puts so much effort into teaching this class.  The content is extremely interesting and very important and provided me an opportunity to apply the data science skills I learned in CS and stats classes to a topic I actually care a lot about. This class has made me consider whether I want to go to grad school for environmental data science and has given me a much deeper appreciation for what it means to make decisions in the face of uncertainty and also for the work that environmental scientists do on a daily basis. I would highly recommend that you have some CS and stats experience before taking this class. Not necessarily at the level of CS 109a or Stat 110 / 111, but certainly some experience because you probably won't get much out of the course without it (or maybe you will but it will be much much harder). Also, really commit to the project! It is an awesome opportunity to experience what it's like to really do this kind of work and you'll learn so much.

They are really eager to help you learn the language and will put in the extra time and effort to make sure that you succeed. They are also really accommodating.

      "Hi! Long story short: I learned a lot of Chinese, but won't take BB because this class was an insane time commitment for me, a real beginner in Mandarin. I think I only read great things about Chinese BA in the Q when I was deciding whether to take this course or not, so I decided to write about the not–so–great ones. By the way, it is true that the teaching staff is extraordinary! Zhang and Guo Laoshi were two of the sweetest teachers I got a chance to meet in my entire life. All professors are super high–energy and encouraging! But PLEASE consider these before taking BA (for context, I'm a STEM major who didn't have a language requirement to fulfill, I was doing Mandarin because I just really wanted to learn it):– This is an intro course, but many people here already have a background, either because they took Chinese in High School or because they are heritage speakers (there is another course for heritage speakers, but many do BA as a convenient way to tackle the language requirement). This can be very frustrating if you feel like you are not keeping up with the rest of your section, so have that in mind before comparing yourself to others! It's still annoying tho.– This course is SUPER FAST PACED. I took two demanding PSET classes and a seminar heavy in readings while taking BA and still had BA as my biggest concern. Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing homework (and I really mean a lot of time, I would often have to thoroughly review the whole lesson before even getting started with the first question).– The course before and after the add–drop period is not the same. In the first weeks, it seems much more manageable than it actually is during the rest of the semester.– Office hours happen during morning and early afternoon. The very own course professors run them  (there are no student TFs or CAs) and they are very good, but keep in mind that scheduling them can be annoying if you have a busy class routine from 9 am to 3 pm.– Going to Vanserg every day got increasingly annoying during the semester (It's a beautiful walk tho! A side of the campus you don't often get to explore as an undergrad. But definitely a commute, particularly if you have classes close to lunch time or in locations like the Allston Campus).With that being said, if you want to learn Chinese, take this course! But if you're a REAL beginner, like, 0 Chinese background (which is in theory the target demographic of the course), keep in mind there is a HOMERIC amount of effort and time you'll be putting in this class. This is not meant to discourage you from taking the course, but I really missed more Q reviews that emphasized this aspect and I don't know if I would have taken the class if I was well aware of it. Good luck!",

      "I am going to focus this review on things first–year students who have placed into Chinese 120a should know. I feel that this is a very good but rather challenging class, especially as a first–year. The workload is equivalent to a pset class, as you have a weekly homework assignment that takes time. On the homework, do the extra credit every single time. It takes only 5 minutes but it will make a huge difference for your grade. There is also a quiz every single Tuesday and Thursday, which covers content for the NEXT lesson (not the previous one). Keep this in mind when you consider your workload and which classes you want to take. The assignments are very much focused on reading, writing, and grammar. I came from a conversationally–focused Chinese program in high school, so this was a big shift for me. If you don't feel confident in your reading and writing (typing) abilities, I would suggest taking Ba or Bb if you want a less demanding experience.  The project is worth a significant proportion of your grade, so do not blow it off. If you use it as an opportunity to genuinely learn about Chinese culture,  you will love it!Do not be discouraged if you perform poorly on the review tests or midterm. They are very hard but  there are plenty of other assignments and  extra credit opportunities to help your grade. The final exam is very hard, too. The instructors are all incredible teachers and care so deeply about their students' success in this class. I cannot say enough good things about them. They are always willing to help, and also make class into a fun environment. A highlight was the tea party they had for us. Because I took a very challenging set of classes this semester, there is a small part of me that wishes I took a lower level class. However, I am ultimately glad I took 120a because I truly learned so much and had a great experience thanks to the instructors. Overall, if you decide to take this class, you will have to work hard but you will have a great time while doing it and also make some great friends along the way.",

It really pushes you to deconstruct, and rethink about how China played a role in the development of western theories on modernization and modernity. What was overlooked?

Though this class is a film and media class, I love the way the professor framed it to be like a history class as well. You learn so much stuff about 20th century Korean history and culture and consequently gain a much deeper understanding of the cultural forces that shape Korean popular culture, both then and now. Even for people who have no interest in K–pop or Korean dramas, I think this class would be equally as fulfilling if you have even a slight interest in modern Korean history. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that both the professor and TF were South Korean, I think this class was able to convey a much more nuanced and accurate perspective of Korean culture than you might get in other EAS classes. Section is honestly just an hour of having the most fun and insightful conversations. Workload is super light, especially relative to the amount of knowledge you get out of the class. Only thing I will say is that Professor Bu does assign quite a bit of reading but they are usually super interesting and you can get a lot out of them from just skimming.",

They make the content digestible and fun. Besides class, there are SO MANY activities from the Japanese language program/ RIJS, and the class has a great community too –– I made more friends in Japanese than any other classes. I was a little scared before taking Japanese BA because many people have said the introductory level language classes at Harvard can be a lot, but I think this class is very manageable and fun. I do recommend that the summer before one could preview hiragana/katakana as I did which will make everything so much easier.

By third year our class is such a tight–knit community We see each other every day and talk so much during all the exercises that we know each other so well and are good friends. I've had たけはら先生 for the past three semesters and she is such a phenomenal professor––she teaches everything so clearly and goes above and beyond to help each of her students improve. なかたに先生 too is so so good, I had her freshman year as well and she always makes drill sections so much fun and fully of happy energy. I am so thankful to them both, I have never met any other professors who care more for their students or give such detailed comments on each and every assignment or who cheer on and celebrate their students always or are so understanding and supportive as 竹原先生 and 仲谷先生. My Japanese has improved immensely throughout this course. I am so looking forward to continuing in the spring! I absolutely recommend this course.

      "Some important context about me: I'm a senior, I'm not Vietnamese, never spoken Vietnamese before, and took this class because my partner is Vietnamese. Best decision ever – I know it can be intimidating to start a language from scratch, especially when there will be other people in the class who have prior experience with Vietnamese. But this class does everything to counter that – honestly, class sections are just so fun and accessible; you're constantly practicing the language and you won't feel afraid to make mistakes because everyone's willing to support each other and learn together. The class had a really strong community feel, and the course staff puts a ton of effort into creating games and other engaging activities that make learning the language so enjoyable. This class was easily the highlight of my semester, and while learning the language is certainly hard in itself, the class is not – it's very accommodating and inclusive. Highly highly recommend for anyone!",

The exams are very fair and if you care at all/put it some effort you can do well on these.

It's a great way to balance a hard semester of courses and you can learn some pretty useful stuff!",

Attendance wasn't mandatory so it was very hard to hold myself accountable to keep up with lecture material. We also had no PSETs, so it was difficult to lock in the understanding of the stuff we learned in lecture. Was a very light class and my work for it ended up being just cramming skipped lectures right before the midterms and final.

      "This is a requirement as an Economics Concentrator, but it should not be a dreaded one. If you choose a subject you are somewhat interested in, the readings can be very engaging. Even if it is not your top choice, there is something to be said about learning to read the type of economics papers you will encounter. There is a ton of reading assigned, especially for someone like me that is a math and social sciences guy. But as my TA said this is a lesson in learning how to skim as much as it is how to read economics papers. A 60 page research paper, in my opinion, has about 30 important pages and a few sentences that are relevant on the other ones. So not that bad. And the paper, if you actually start early, is genuinely fun. Meet with your TA about the code and get all your regressions and results coded out early. That way whenever you sit down to write its not actually an awful time crunch but more doable. And its like working out: hard, but feels awesome after your done.

When its finally time to submit your topic/paper proposal, it will take weeks to find a topic that works, especially because you need to find data, code, methods etc. This course should be structured to help students find their topics way earlier on. A week before the final paper is due, most students in my section did not have a clear direction. A total mess.

We went over many interesting topics, ranging from momentum trading and behavioral phenomena such as investor attention, to unique topics like meme stocks. It was a fair amount of work, with two short (~1 page) papers per week near the beginning of the semester, moving to working on components of the final paper near the end of the semester. I was very thankful for this format because it gave the opportunity to receive consistent feedback so you can improve with each assignment, and it made it nearly impossible to procrastinate too badly on the final paper.

That said, it is probably helpful to be interested in behavioral economics but even if you didn't like it coming in you'll gain an appreciation for the subject matter. This is especially true if you do the optional readings, which will really round out your understanding throughout the semester. Also, choose your final project wisely and actually do it throughout the course. The grading seems to be much more based on improvement from prior submissions so the more you give Landoni to grade the more you'll be able to enact the changes he wants. One warning, though, is that he can be a tough grader which can make for thin margins if your main pursuit is getting an A. That said, it's still worth taking the course, especially since if you put in work he'll certainly recognize that."

Still, concurrent enrollment is very much feasible, though a bit more challenging.The feedback Victoria and Prof. Goldin provide is detailed and nearly instantaneous, often returned the very same day.

This includes going to section, 2.5 hours for the MCQ, 3+ hours for the LP, and then a couple hours of just general content review (which is crucial for the course, in my opinion). The MCQs (especially) and LPs are quite difficult, but they map really well onto the midterm and final. For studying for the exams, the bulk of what I did was just reviewing the MCQs and LPs, as they are very useful. In some ways, I almost found Ec1010a easier than Ec10a at times because the LPs and MCQs were so difficult, and the exams were easier in comparison. Also, definitely go to lecture and do the CRQs, as these also appear on MCQs and exams and are super helpful for deepening your knowledge. And find a study group for the MCQs early!! Overall, this course is hard but super rewarding, and you will walk a way with a very comprehensive understanding of microeconomics.",

It's also definitely helpful that it's not a 9am if you want to actually go to lecture! If you are looking for more of a small class experience, you want to go to lecture, and you think psets would help you understand the material, I would take this version. If you are looking to get the class over with using the least weekly work possible and have recorded lectures, I would take the spring version since there are not psets.

      "A Frustrating and Useless Economics CourseThis course was an absolute disaster from start to finish. It is shocking how little thought seemed to go into making this class a worthwhile educational experience. Here are just a few of the glaring issues that made this class worth avoiding if possible:Problem Sets: A Marathon of TediumThe problem sets were absurdly long, often nearing 100 questions. This would be bad enough if they were meaningful, but they were anything but. Instead of fostering understanding, they devolved into tedious calculation marathons that added no real value to mastering the material. To make matters worse, many of the problems were structured to cascade: if you made a single mistake early on, it snowballed, guaranteeing you got several more questions wrong. This setup punished even minor errors and discouraged actual learning.Lectures: A Waste of TimeThe lectures were utterly unhelpful. The professor’s slides were crammed with irrelevant math and equations—stuff that didn’t even align with the level of understanding required for the course. Rather than clarifying or simplifying concepts, the lectures left students more confused. If you walked in hoping for clear, concise explanations, you walked out disappointed (and more stressed than when you came in).Exams: Unreasonably Difficult and ArbitraryThe midterm and final exams were very difficult—not because they tested mastery of the material, but because they were riddled with random, nitpicky questions. It’s absurd to expect students to recall obscure tidbits from readings or parse the meaning of some minor detail on a graph buried in the lengthy textbook or one of the many readings assigned. This format doesn’t measure understanding—it’s a scavenger hunt designed to trip students up. Add in the multiple–choice calculation problems, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. A single small math error meant getting multiple questions wrong. This is an economics course, not a math competition!Overall Experience: Frustrating and PointlessUltimately, this course completely failed to fulfill the purpose of an economics class: TEACHING ECONOMICS. The relentless focus on excessive calculations and arbitrary details detracted from any meaningful engagement with broader concepts or critical thinking. Instead of leaving the class feeling enriched, I walked away frustrated, burnt out, and deeply disappointed. Every review I read on the Q before taking this course proved accurate, showing that the professor and the economics department clearly have no interest in improving this course or providing an enriching experience for future economists. If you're reading this and considering taking this course, don’t be surprised if nothing changes. If you’re taking this course as a requirement, it’s doable, so don’t stress too much. However, don’t expect to gain much from it—it’s unlikely you’ll walk away feeling like a more confident macroeconomist.",

      "*** FROM A EC1011A and STAT 110 student *** I took both Ec1011a and Stat110 at the same time — sophomore fall — and want to first say that it is totally doable (coming from someone who got a B+ in Math 21a). But boy was I wrong about the relative difficulty. I thought that Ec1011 would be mind–boggling hard and Stat110 would be a walk in the park but I could not be more wrong. I thought that Stat110 was a much harder course than Ec1011 for a couple of reasons: (1) Stat has a wide distribution of student abilities so some people get 95 or 100s on the tests, while others get 40s and this means it is much harder to get a good grade as you need to compete relatively against some strong classmates. However in Ec1011, everyone, no matter how much of a math genius they are, does poorly on the test (around a 50 with a tight SD) so if you are just average like me, you won’t suffer under the intelligence of your smarter peers. (2) Ec1011 is just multivariable calculus and taking derivatives which is much more algorithmic (and you have practice in HS), so the math can be messy but it is not extraordinarily difficult. Also the economic logic taught in the course is very self–intuitive, so you can generally know a sensible answer to the question.  However with Stat, it is much more about logical, creative problem solving akin to competition math problems which was harder for me (and many others) as you’re not taught in high school how to solve math problems creatively and find a neat trick that makes the problem a lot easier. I found that Ec was more manageable as everyone is similarly lost together in lecture and the class, while in Stat everyone is expected to understand the material, so if you take both classes at the same time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPENDING MORE TIME ON STAT — your grade in Econ will only improve by so much and you can take the time to study the material around the midterm and final when Aakaash’s review sections give you a good sense of what will be on the test. Spend the much more important weekly time on getting started on the Stat psets early and building your problem solving skills there. EC1011a vs. Ec1010a For those on the fence, I would highly recommend taking Ec1011a over 1010. (1) In 1011, a majority of the students get an A– or above as the curve is now more lenient than it used to be (coming from Prof. Glaeser himself) as it needs to more closely match the 1010 grade distribution. I think college is about taking classes that will challenge you and where you will learn a lot (1011), rather than taking a sleepy class where you can coast by and not get the full Harvard experience (1010), so I implore you to ponder about whether you want to make your college experience rewarding and intellectually stimulating or coast by in boredom/ambivalence and wonder why you spend so much money to take boring classes.  (2) The material and skills you learn in 1011 are MUCH MORE satisfying than in 1010. In 1011, you understand and appreciate the importance of modeling in economics and it introduces key concepts like insurance, moral hazard, intertemporal consumption, and monopolies in a much more interesting manner. (3) Professor Glaeser is an incredibly accomplished professor, and despite the fact that he lectures at an incredibly fast pace and takes partials at the speed of light, it felt like taking use of Harvard’s resources to hear from a potential future Nobel laureate. His theory on spatial equilibrium and special topics on the economics of crime, hatred and cities are eye–opening and reveal why microeconomics is such an interesting topic and the variety of ways it can be applied. (4) The first couple weeks of 1011 are designed to scare people off and they are actually the toughest in the course (it gets easier from there). The math before the midterm is really messy and scary, but after the midterm the topics become more interesting, the math is simpler and people are just tired of doing crazy math, so it gets easier from there. If you can survive the early rough patches, you will be in for a great course. Tips to succeed in the course 1. Read/Gloss over ALL the lecture slides before Ed’s lectures. He speeds through material at a speed of light in lecture and even the most smart math people I know couldn’t keep up pace sometimes with how fast he took derivatives. Reading through the lecture slides in advance to understand how he set up a model or does the math will be great so that in class you can just focus on understanding the economic intuition that is much more valuable to grasp in this course. 2. Go to office hours to do psets. The psets (at least in the beginning) are mathematically intense so showing up to office hours and doing them under the guidance of the CA are useful so you aren’t led astray. Also the wording can be confusing and vague so great to get their advice about what the question is aksing you to solve. 3. Psets are graded on completion — if you are hacking away at math and can’t quite get the right answer just move on. As long as you do/attempt 75% of the pset and spend a good 5 hours, you will come away with full marks so don’t stress4. Attend Aakaash’s review section. These are incredible useful not only when it comes to studying for the midterm/finals, but also for reviewing the weekly lecture material as he draws on it for TFUs and questions on the exams. 5. Understand that you will only understand 50% of Ed’s lectures. He breezes by lecture content as he is very smart and there is a ton of material packed in, so know that you are not alone in barely being able to follow with his lectures 6. Go into the lecture with a goal of understanding the intuition and not the math. The intuition is very important in this course — that’s what the tests generally test you on, and the math can be secondary to that. No one will really understand the math on your first go, but you always have the time to review the slides and ask the course staff later about math questions. But Ed doesn’t record lecture and can breeze through the logic of the all–important economic intuition so focus on that.",

      "This course provides a unique opportunity to explore Professor Miron's consequential libertarian perspective on a wide range of major policies, encouraging students to engage with real–world political issues. One of the key strengths is the flexibility of the course structure. You can sign up for any section that fits your schedule, and each section is led by different TFs or past students, which brings varied insights to the material. Additionally, the optional writing requirement is a great feature—it only accounts for 5% of the grade and is graded leniently, making it an easy way to boost your grade. The grading is generous overall, with a curve, and the course workload is manageable (e.g., there is no homework). However, it’s important to stay on top of the readings and class discussions. Another strength is the accessibility of lecture materials, with slides and videos posted on Canvas, allowing students to review the content at their own pace. As I anticipated, the grading structure was oversimplified: it consists of three (and optionally four) components—Final (50%), Midterm (40%), and Attendance (10%), with an optional economics writing requirement (5%) that scales down the weight of the other components. This means that your grade is heavily dependent on the midterm and final exams. Given that the material on the midterm is independent of the final, it’s crucial to perform well on both. The exams are mostly focused on memorizing readings and lecture material, so taking detailed notes is essential. The slides, while useful, are minimalistic (black text on a white background); be sure to supplement them with your own notes. Additionally, the slides from section meetings aren’t always posted, so it’s important to stay engaged and attentive during those discussions.As for Professor Miron’s teaching, while his libertarian perspective is thought–provoking and much of it makes sense, some of his arguments can come across as radical. At times, he would claim that those who disagreed with his views lacked strong evidence, referencing studies that weren’t always persuasive. With that being said, this aspect of the course is always an opportunity for intellectual engagement, as you can agree with or challenge his points and ask questions to explore your viewpoints. The freedom to share your opinions and dig deeper into the material is one of the most valuable aspects of the class, allowing you to form your own perspective on the libertarian arguments presented.",

If you need an elective for Ec then DEFINITELY take it, but still take it regardless of major, because it has so much interesting content and is relevant to every field. You will learn about puzzles/problems in global health and how people have tried to address them in the past and what worked and what did not, but you will mostly learn about how to tackle these problems and what epistemological issues led to poor solution–development in the past. Professor Basilico is brilliant and will change the way you see the world—I came out of this class a more optimistic person about lots of development issues around the world, and was motivated to do the readings (which are all fascinating and super understandable!!) including the textbook which he wrote which summarizes things really nicely and in a thought–provoking way. You'll learn the methods of lots of quasi–experimental methods in economic research on development/health issues and also how to read and understand the numbers in those papers, which is super useful in general. They also offer lots of support for the final project, so talk to the TFs and the professor about whatever you are curious/confused about and they'll be great help.Definitely take it—you will have a great time and learn so much.",

      "This course will probably have a bimodal distribution for its ratings. In the first section of this review, I will discuss the first half of the class. In the second section, I discuss the second half. Finally, I conclude and suggest avenues for future exploration.First half: David L. is such a good professor! He is so nice and really cares about everyone. The material can be a bit dry at time since the first half is really about methods, getting you familiar with dynamic program, Bellman equation, stochastic processes, etc, but he is a very engaging lecturer.  He's done this class forever, so lectures are incredibly efficient at getting you to know what you need to know and understand it at a deep level. HWs could be a bit long but nothing too egregious; very clear and relevant questions. He also uploads solutions a day in advance so that if you get stuck, you aren't stuck forever and can get a little hint. Midterm was incredibly fair, maybe a tad on the easier side. Second half: David L. is pretty funny and seems like a great guy, but not always the best professor. Lectures tended to run over time and we wouldn't finish all the content in models, so he made it so that sections covered new content that wasn't taught in class. Homework assignments were not clearly worded and took a very long time to complete. The midterm was also confusingly worded and on the long side for the amount of algebra required. It was also a bit strange when he pointed at an Asian student on the first day and asked if he was from Japan to make a point about economic growth across countries (the student was of Chinese origin). His research is incredibly interesting though, and his macrodevelopment class next semester sounds exciting.Takeaways: This is a required class for the PhD sequence so there is not much choice there (unless you are an undergraduate, of which there were several in this class; not sure if this class is the best choice for undergraduates since 2010A is probably a much stronger signal unless you plan on taking 2010D in the spring). David Laibson is excellent. The second half will likely change next year since David Lagakos was a visiting professor; even if he is teaching it next time, I'm sure it'll be more polished the second time around. Mixed feelings overall about how much I gained from this class.",

      "Make no mistake, this is a challenging course, even if you've taken intermediate–ish micro in the past.  Essentially, it's as close as an economist will ever come to engineering — plenty of optimization problems, which you'll get plenty comfortable with.  You'll benefit from a solid grounding in multivariate calc, and some background in probability theory, optimization, proof–based courses, and differential equations would all be helpful (though not strictly required, perhaps).  All of this being said, Luis does a great job of bringing energy to his lectures and works with you to demystify a notoriously misunderstood and oversimplified branch of social science.  Building from the basic question of \"how can we even say things about how preferences map to economic decision making?\" and ending with \"what happens to an economy when we push on one thing just a little bit?\" this is a wonderful beginning–to–end exercise in understanding how to rigorously think through economic decisions and how they beget their own special equilibria.  Don't take the course if you're afraid of struggling with hard concepts.  Do take the course if you want to understand those hard concepts just a little more than you did before!",

      "SUCH A LOVELY COURSE! ES51 FTW! But definitely a huge time commitment!!Hi! If you're deciding whether to take ES51 or not, the question is simple: major/requirement–wise, do you need to take it? – If so, take it as soon as possible! The skills learned in the course are so useful no matter what career you choose! I'm glad I took it in my Freshman Fall because I now feel much more prepared and certain about following a career in Mechanical Engineering.– If not: are you willing to take the challenge? This class is a HUGE time commitment, and it is really not worth it if you won't be able to put in the effort. If you decide to take it: this class is worth every single atom of dedication you can offer. Seymur is not a particularly good lecturer, but he is probably the sweetest person in John A. Paulson and he makes a real effort to get to know his students individually. He always stays after class taking any questions you might have, either about the content or about a career in Engineering. It's clearly that he loves his students! Class and lab often didn't have a very clear connection, but lab was so cool! I learned so much. If you can, stay in the lab after hours, and take your time to really explore all the resources available to you. This class is not only an intro to Mechanical Engineering, but also a wonderful intro to Engineering at Harvard as a whole and the resources at the SEC. Don't come into this class with a mindset to do the bare minimum – the more you put in, the more you take away. Befriend your TFs and understand that there is truly a lot of help to help you navigate ES51. With that being said, Turf Wars was a magical way to wrap up the semester, and I feel like I'm walking out of this class with a real community of Mechie peers and friends!",

      "This class was not a good experience. Do keep in mind that this course probably won't be with Chris and Gu again in the near future, so my words probably don't have much bearing on what your experience will be like. But yeah, this was a huge slog, and we did not learn very much at all. My chief complaint about this class is that we did not use any of the skills we have built up in our engineering classes to complete this project. I know there aren't many serious problems you could solve using two years of college education, but really, I believe the only requirement for this class is Expos 20. You did not need to have taken a single engineering class to do this project. Chris and Gu were very upfront early on about how an actual physical product would likely be outside the scope of the class they designed, like that was not a serious problem with the class! On our very first day, they showed us some of the past projects that previous years have worked on, to help generate excitement. It's ironic that all of these past examples were cool robots solving a smaller scale problem. Chris and Gu know that this is what we are here to do! Please make sure that we can!Anyway, you have to take this class, so I should offer some advice rather than just complain. If/when you get the opportunity to speak to experts in the field you are working on, take every one that you get. It will be the most helpful thing for your project by a mile. Aggressively hunt for interviews early on, these will give you real direction for your project, and offer some perspective that you can't just get on google scholar. Honestly, I would be saying much better things about my time in this class if I had done more of this early on – for future instructors, please note that this is the absolute most helpful thing for the students, and you should ensure that at least 3 expert interviews are conducted by each team.

The lectures were well structured, and all materials and recordings were posted online. The provided textbooks are great, and I highly recommend you read on each chapter before/after lecture. There will always be some confusing bits – I still went to office hours just about every week – but that's how it always is. The biggest strength this class has are its psets. They aren't easy, but they are super fair, well structured, and give you the chance to practice the same ideas at least a couple times so you feel like you've gotten the hang of them by the end. This class won't be easy, but I never once felt like the work I was putting in wasn't going anywhere.ES125 is exactly how all of your engineering requirements should be – they will not all be this way, so just enjoy 125 while you have it. Conversely, if you take 125 early on and really don't like it, I would seriously recommend you reconsider engineering. It doesn't get much better than this, and it sure gets a lot worse.",

      "This is a fantastic class! It’s definitely a lot of work—sometimes challenging—but overall, it’s thoughtfully designed to help you learn the material effectively. The structure encourages you to engage with the teaching staff through various avenues like Slack, office hours, and sections. While attending office hours is optional, I believe it’s a crucial part of the class experience. If you’re a bit of an introvert like me, you might miss out on some valuable insights from direct conversations with Gage, but please try as that is part of the class design (fortunately or unfortunately depending on who you are). Don’t hesitate to Slack Gage and ask questions—he is incredibly helpful!For problem sets, it’s easy to fall behind because they can be quite lengthy. Try to stay on track, as keeping pace with the class allows you to collaborate with friends, attend office hours, and benefit from section discussions. These often cover portions of the problem set, which can be incredibly helpful—something you’ll miss if you fall behind.The labs are awesome and super fun! To make the most of your time, go through the lab assignments beforehand and complete any tasks that don’t require lab equipment. This will save you time and help you get as much done as possible during the lab session.Lastly, if you haven’t taken ES 50 or don’t have much soldering experience, practice ahead of time! The soldering competition is a fun and rewarding part of the course.",

It was clear that she is incredibly passionate both about what she was teaching and about her students and their well–being, even to the point of buying the whole 30+ person lecture cookies/donuts multiple times during the semester. She was also very knowledgeable, particularly about genres and technical elements. She and both TFs were both very available through office hours and email, and you would earn extra points for seeking feedback from them before turning in an assignment. She was definitely a stricter grader than my TF, but both left detailed feedback and grades that I thought were reasonable. Stephanie graded 4 out of 5 assignments, and I could tell she was getting to know us as writers/matching our writing to our contributions to class discussions as the semester went on.Structure–wise, I really liked that the class defined literature as \"anything with words,\" because it meant that we got to study music and film/TV as well as poetry and novels and plays. Stephanie also made an effort to represent different types of voices/characters in what we read, which I appreciated, and she asked for our preferences towards the end of the semester, which meant that we got to watch Fleabag and analyze it! The reading was reasonable (up to a short book per week, but usually a dozen poems or a short play or a couple of songs), and our TFs worked to make all readings available for free (!!) through the library so that we didn't have to buy everything being taught ourselves. Stephanie also seemed to have connections to everyone and was able to set up Zooms/in–person visits from something like 60–70% of all of the authors/creators we studied, including Dessa, Monica Yoon, and Danez Smith. It was so so cool to be able to meet the creators of what we were studying and ask them questions about their work/life as a professional artist. In terms of assignments, you could choose from 20 creative and 20 analytical prompts, and the class encouraged you to take risks by dropping your lowest creative assignment grade at the end of the semester. I also appreciated the built–in peer workshops and opportunities for discussion in section. Both Manan and Imani were incredible and so so knowledgeable about what we were studying!I wouldn't say that this class was easy, and I definitely had to work hard (especially on my written assignments), but I found it to be really rewarding and enjoyable. Take this class with an open mind, participate in class discussions, and really dig deep into the assigned reading :)",
      "The course itself depends a lot on the professor and TFs. The curriculum is chosen by the professor, and although they try to select a range of literature, it is likely that the majority is in a field that the professor is more knowledgeable in. The lecture style also wasn't something I particularly enjoyed, with most of it being asking questions to students about their thoughts on the readings, and many awkward pauses when no hands were raised (many people weren't even paying attention). Section was also rather lackluster, with my TF not being super passionate + only really figuring out how they wanted to structure the section more than halfway through the semester. Again, though, how these things turn out really depends on which professor/TFs are leading the course that semester",

This was my first English class at Harvard (took it as a distributional requirement during my Senior Fall) and I loved it so much, I'm going to take another one in the Spring! Professor Stauffer's feedback was so encouraging and helpful. He is so knowledgeable, it's inspiring. And, he is accessible and always willing to help / brainstorm essay ideas. The readings were fascinating and not too long. Sometimes the classes felt like they were a little too long + there were definitely some section kid commentary.

The texts don't need any introduction, they truly are *transformative*, and Professor Wood is incredibly smart and knowledgeable (as are the people taking the class with you). Reading these incredible books alongside others and with such insightful guidance was exactly the kind of experience I hoped for when coming to Harvard. However, I found the format of the course a bit challenging—it's a mix between a lecture and a seminar, which didn’t really work for me. For a seminar, the class size was quite large, so contributing often felt intimidating—like giving a speech with 20 people around the table. I would have preferred a more traditional lecture format or a smaller seminar setting. Additionally, while it was wonderful to hear everyone’s scattered thoughts, the discussions tended to feel unstructured. If you’re hoping for a focused exploration of consciousness or a clear thematic thread, you might find it harder to extract cohesive ideas, as our discussions often revolved around whatever we found interesting in the books. Additionally, the grading relies on two essays without rubrics or structured prompts—you have the freedom to write on any topic, but this can feel risky if you’re concerned about your GPA. Despite these structural challenges, I am so glad I took this class. I learned a lot, and the experience of engaging with these texts in such an enthusiastic, intelligent environment was so rewarding!",

I'm so glad I took this and developed a reverence and appreciation for the genius that was Shakespeare. While we do move pretty quickly with a play a week, this course goes for breadth over depth; nonetheless, each week's lectures and sections are always very fun and engaging, and the great chronological breadth of the course allows us to really see central themes, motifs, and developments across Shakespeare's entire body of work.I personally appreciated Professor's lively attitude and usage of student actors; he always kept lectures rich, textually grounded but also coherent and with a story of some sorts, and this was really useful. Lastly, I came to love the film component of the course, and watching various performances and adaptations of Shakespeare's plays really enhanced my understanding of his plays.Overall, great class! Lots of fun and relaxed environment, you'll learn a tremendous amount. You get what you put in, which is good. You could spend 10–15 hours reading a single play or 2–4 hours. Highly recommend you invest!",

The assignments did pick up towards the second half of the course but Professor Lynch was very receptive to my request for an extension and I appreciated the opportunity to turn in work I felt I was truly proud of. The prompts for the evaluative papers were really interesting and I often had difficulty picking just one to write on. Going to the Houghton Museum for the first research paper was also a really unique experience and one I'm glad I had as I learned so much about fandom in the 19th–century and how people consumed and interacted with art. Class discussions were always engaging and even I wasn't up to participating, learning from others was still a highlight of class time. I'm not an English concentrator and was a bit hesitant about the course for that reason, and the standards for writing certainly aren't low in the class, but I felt like I could go to my TF with questions or discuss the feedback on my writing which was very helpful for future assignments.

Professor Doherty strikes a good balance between lecture and student guided questions and discussions. Professor Doherty was always prepared with passages from the novel to examine and common themes to discuss but there was always time to dedicate to answering student's questions and looking at passages of interest.The reading load is pretty manageable but depending on how quickly you read can take up a good amount of time. Each reading assignment was around 100 pages. I took American Women Writers as a Freshman before my expos course (a Harvard introductory course to writing) and I thought the assignments themselves were quite reasonable and manageable. I will say sometimes I was confused about what criteria a certain style of assignment required, but Professor Doherty was always happy to clarify.

I loved my section TF William! He was a great facilitator who did a wonderful job with encouraging collaboration in section through group activity and games like Jeopardy! William also provided wonderful feedback on my ideas before the deadline, so I had the best chance of submitting work that would get me my desired grade of an A. So, I recommend you go to OH for your TF since they can be really helpful!",

It truly feels like an environmental engineering class, rather than just an environmental science or engineering course. The material is challenging but rewarding. You get to apply fluid dynamics, mass balances, energy dynamics, thermodynamics, and more to fascinating water–quality problems. The course also aligns with current standard environmental methods, and legal frameworks are introduced as useful references.   The lab component is stellar; it really makes you think critically about water and how it’s managed. I also appreciated the community engagement aspect—visiting the Alewife Brook as an example of a stormwater basin was genuinely inspiring. Patrick is an incredibly kind and talented lecturer who is also very accessible to discuss the class with outside class time too. People make effort to show up to class for good reason and my classmates were also a wonderful supportive resource too.

He is so kind to his students and puts so much effort into teaching this class.  The content is extremely interesting and very important and provided me an opportunity to apply the data science skills I learned in CS and stats classes to a topic I actually care a lot about. This class has made me consider whether I want to go to grad school for environmental data science and has given me a much deeper appreciation for what it means to make decisions in the face of uncertainty and also for the work that environmental scientists do on a daily basis. I would highly recommend that you have some CS and stats experience before taking this class. Not necessarily at the level of CS 109a or Stat 110 / 111, but certainly some experience because you probably won't get much out of the course without it (or maybe you will but it will be much much harder). Also, really commit to the project! It is an awesome opportunity to experience what it's like to really do this kind of work and you'll learn so much.

      "I really enjoyed ESPP78. But I have a lot of mixed feelings. Here are the positives: the course is super interesting and you learn soooo much about environmental politics in the US and abroad. Professor Jasanoff is super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and the lectures were very digestible. Section was engaging, as we could interact a bit more with our peers. I feel like I really improved my writing through the weekly response papers. I am leaving the course with a very strong foundation in environmental politics, and I love how the course is broken up into science, economics, law, and ethics modules. Super interdisciplinary, and it actually made me consider other career options in the field. The TFs are also super kind and want you to succeed.Here are the negatives: while the course readings are super well–curated, there is a RIDICULOUS amount of readings for every lecture. I don't even know how one could manage reading them all (which the TFs and prof expect) without making ESPP78 their priority for the semester. I still feel like I got a lot out of the course without doing many of the readings. The weekly response papers are pretty manageable, but the grading is a bit harsh and picky. The midterm is really hard and such a time crunch, and grading is also picky. The grading is also so ambiguous, and I’m really not sure what my grade will be. Also, the TFs can be a bit inflexible in terms of absences (and again, unclear how this will affect your grade). There is a final research paper and final take–home exam, which is a lot at the end of the semester. It was manageable enough though.All in all, I really loved ESPP78 and learned so much, but some of the course admin stuff is quite frustrating.",
      "– Don't take this as a junior or senior. I took this as a senior and felt like lots of the main themes had already been covered by other courses I took. – This is a good survey of the largest environmental problems we face and why they're so hard to solve. Overall, what I enjoyed learning about the most was case studies and not the overarching themes. – Lectures were not very helpful IMO. Jasanoff talks in a way that references the slides but for some reason was very hard for me to follow. Still attend all of them, as attendance factors into the grade. – Weekly response paper grades were hard to interpret – instead of percentages or letter grades, you can get a \"check minus\", \"check\", and \"check plus\". I couldn't tell the difference between my papers that got a \"check\" and \"check plus\", even after reading TF feedback. – Look at all the readings and choose ~50% of them to read fully. You'll need to reference specific case studies, authors, and concepts in the midterm and final. Making a big google doc with all the readings and main points was helpful for me. – having both a final project and exam is a little brutal. I chose to do a group project, which I think was honestly less work than an individual paper.",

Joroff is always willing to meet and answer your questions, and is super accessible. Only thing to keep in mind– this class is definitely technical, and as someone with no law or government background, there was a bit of a learning curve. Also, the assignments were graded a bit harshly, and it was difficult to improve for the subsequent assignment, since each paper tests a different legal skill and doesn't build off of the previous.

Instead of slaying yourself with 4 difficult classes your first semester (Expos 20), take a more balanced approach to your schedule with Expos 10. You'll move at a very manageable rate, easing yourself into readings, annotating techniques, and general academic writing methods. You'll leave the course with a \"playbook\" of techniques to use for future essays. 4. Your GPA won't take a huge hit like your peers in Expos 205. I'd be willing to bet most people in my Expos 10 could have taken Expos 20 and walked away with a reputable grade... it's not as difficult as it's made out to be, but don't underestimate how much extra time you'll spend on Expos 20 compared to Expos 10.

      "If you are hesitant about your writing ability, I beg you to please consider taking this class. I came into Harvard having done some essay writing before and got great marks and good grades in my writing, so I was initially hesitant in taking EXPOS 10 and not 20. What made me reconsider, though, was the writing placement test where I found myself a little confused and unfamiliar with the types of writing that appeared on the test. The writing test is genuinely a fantastic indicator as to which class you are suited for! You then have a call with an expos advisor, and mine told me that they could tell from my test that my writing instincts were super strong! But, they could see that I was slightly unfamiliar with the form of writing present, hence I took EXPOS 10 and I have NO regrets. Super thankful I took this class. EXPOS 10 has a very steady pace, very generous assignments and deadlines, and overall will NOT cause you much stress in freshman fall. Believe me,  from everyone around me and my own experience, most people will opt for all the harder classes in freshman fall thinking they will be super fine and then will suffer massively trying to navigate such hard classes in a new environment bringing many new and difficult challenges. This class was genuinely the best part of my week. Relaxing and super educational and informative. I left with a vastly better competency to write and learnt SO much about my own writing style and it's strengths, weaknesses and how I can improve in the future and in EXPOS 20. Writing is an invaluable skill! Making the decision to take things slowly and complete 2 semesters of writing instead of 1 (as a future CS concentrator by the way!) in order to have super strong foundations and competency in writing is genuinely the best decision I have made here. My instructor, Jonah Johnson, is also singlehandedly one of the greatest humans I have ever met. He is an incredible instructor: extremely knowledgeable and wise; incredibly friendly and fosters the creation of a very comfortable environment; and extremely understanding and kind if you ever have ANY struggles during the course. He is absolutely dedicated to making EXPOS 10 the most positive, productive and non–pressuring/scary learning experience possible for every individual in the class. You will never regret selecting him as your instructor – I assure you that much! :)",

While some of the readings felt repetitive and unclear, I appreciated the opportunity to write a proposal and engage with the HUDS approach, though I would have liked more interactive elements. The unit on Sandel was my favorite, but it felt rushed, and I wished we had more time to dive deeper into the material and receive more feedback. Each unit had its strengths, and I think a more collaborative, hands–on approach could have enhanced my engagement with the content. This course is a great gateway for those looking to strengthen foundational writing skills and build confidence, especially if you feel you could benefit from revisiting the basics. However, if you’ve had intensive writing experience in high school, Expos 20 might be a better fit. There were times when writing about topics I didn’t personally care about left me feeling unmotivated, so if that’s a concern for you, selecting a course that aligns more with your interests could make the experience more engaging.

      "For the most part \"Rationality and the Supernatural\" is an accurate name to describe what you should expect from the ideas discussed in this course. That being said, it does lean very heavily into the world of anthropology (specifically concerning the world of African witchcraft, though you will explore this topic in other cultures also). Expect to do a decent amount of reading. Some of the readings can be a little dense, long, and hard to understand, but many of them are also very enjoyable. Bafford really helps you out with the paper–writing process. He is very understanding and helps nudge along your ideas. If you want to get stronger as a writer and feel interested in this topic, then I highly recommend taking this course. Honestly, when choosing an Expos course, choose one that really interests you despite the workload. It is so much easier to write a good paper on something that interests you than to just write a paper on a topic you think will be simple and easy to write about. Trust me, it sounds counterintuitive but it works. It's why I found writing for this class great. I liked the essay prompts we were given, and even now, as I am in the middle of writing my final research paper, I am enjoying the writing process (despite how worried I feel about it, haha). But seriously, don't sleep on this Expos section, especially if you are a student who just feels like you need to get Expos out of the way. Bafford is a good teacher, he helps keep discussions informative and entertaining, and he will help you get better with your academic writing.",

      "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Taboo wasn’t my first choice for the Expos lottery but I’m so glad that I ended up in it! I think that to succeed in an Expos class, you must be a little interested in the material (you don’t have to be overly passionate about it) and jive well with your professor. For example, I don’t feel strongly about cultural taboos but I found them interesting enough to be able to come up with essays that genuinely excited me. It definitely helped that Doug was super flexible with our essay topics; he gave us a LOT of creative freedom with our essays. Doug is also very, very understanding about extensions and conscious about our workloads outside of Expos. His policy on extensions (I’m not sure if this is standard across other Expos courses) was essentially “no questions asked.” He gave us 168 hours of free extension time to use across the semester and at the end of the semester, expressed that if we needed more time beyond that, we could have it. I rarely asked for extensions in high school but I ended up using all of my free extension time. When he assigned longer readings, he never expected us to throughly read them (he told us skimming was ok) which was also very nice.Lastly, this may have been specific to the cohort of people in my class but I genuinely looked forward to class every Tuesday/Thursday because of the people. Doug’s ice breakers at the start of every class definitely bonded us and by the end of the semester, we were all pretty close. Our closeness made for a very fun classroom environment and now that I think about it, I don’t think that I ever dreaded going to this Expos class. All that to say… I have ZERO REGRETS about taking this course and if you’re feeling hesitant about it, definitely give it a chance!!!",

      "I have very mixed feelings about the class. Looking at it objectively, I think the class was great and deeply improved my writing. Additionally, the topic of magical realism was super interesting, providing for super in–depth and creative analysis. If you really enjoy literary analysis and argumentation, then this class is great for you. The readings are super interesting, relatively short in length, and really digestible, and you even get to watch two movies as part of the class, all provided for free. Overall, I loved the topic, and I think it is one of the most interesting expos topics out there. The class also creates a really collaborative environment through small–group and whole–class discussions in class.The class itself was taught really well and engagingly, and Dr. Brown is super supportive. He is great and you can tell that he really, deeply cares about the students and their growth as writers. His feedback is great, but in the nature of preparing arguments regarding Magical Realism, it can often take some time before you and Dr. Brown fully understand what each other are talking about during conferences. So, just make sure you are well–prepared to concisely explain your questions and thesis if you want to make the most out of conferences with him, as they can be extremely constructive if properly prepared for. However, one piece of advice that I wish I had prior to taking the class ––– during the final project season, if an assignment is vague, great! It means you can take some liberties with how you complete it. Don't stress too much about how exactly it should be done, because Dr. Brown probably wanted you to have freedom in completing it the way that best suited you and your argument.However, in the context of this class being one of many expos options, I would like to point out a few things. Firstly, this class is pretty fast–paced compared to some other expos. I often found myself completing final drafts while my friends in other expos courses were working on first drafts. While this may be annoying in the middle of the semester, it becomes pretty nice during the time for working on the final paper, as we end up having much more time to flesh out our papers than other students in other, slower–paced expos courses do. Secondly, I will say that this class is very well–tailored to analytical essays, which makes it slightly less applicable to other areas of life. While it is great at preparing you to use online databases and do research and is generally great for improving writing and argumentation skills, it is very tailored to the analysis of magical realism, which may make it hard to apply this course elsewhere.Overall, I think this class was super useful in improving my writing skills, and Dr. Brown was incredibly supportive along the way. The class was a bit fast–paced in the middle, and did require a lot more work than some other expos courses. However, I got a lot out of the class and really enjoyed writing the final paper. At the end of the day, I think the class was an overall positive experience, and I would generally encourage anyone to take this class if they are interested in the topic, enjoy writing literary analysis articles, and are willing to put in the extra work.",
      "DO NOT TAKE THIS EXPOS especially if you are a STEM student. It's very time consuming compared to other EXPOS classes. It will not give you research or analysis competences that are useful to STEM. The grading is harsh. The feedback is extremely vague. If you haven't done literary analysis in depth and if you don't want to do it in the future this class is going to make you miserable.",

Professor Garcia is super passionate about both conspiracies and writing, gives timely feedback, and is generally a really chill person to talk to. That being said, he does have solid expectations (at least compared to my friends' experiences in other sections) and wants to challenge your writing, so the feedback will sometimes be tough and it might be challenging to come up with a thesis for some of the essay topics. Deadlines for essay drafts will often be quite crammed, which made me stressed at times. We didn't have a lot of long readings –– sometimes, the readings were just \"busy work\", in my opinion, but the sample essays and pieces on writing well were quite helpful.

      "TLDR: This class is Hum10 if it was an Expos class. THIS IS WORK. To all upcoming expos takers know that this class is not a walk in the park. To start off, the discussions had in class were really amazing. Maybe its the nature of the course or just that everyone who takes it is cracked, but literary analysis and discussion in this class consistently happened at an engaging and high level that mirrored a sort of intellectualism found in the salons of the Enlightenment age. Overall this alone made the class very enjoyable, and the readings and assignments made sense and were fun, especially for a certain subset of people. That certain subset being people who REALLY like literature/humanities. This classes greatest asset is also my greatest worry in recommending it to other people. If you already have a stacked schedule, I would not recommend this Expos class as an easy edition. Your writing will definitely be held to higher standards and expectations than reports I have heard from many other Expos students in my year. Writing at a Hum10/very sophisticated level is encouraged and at points expected, and looking between the fine lines into ways to write on topics that could be dissertations with a constraint of 8 pages is a challenge you will face. Gauvreau is a very nice professor and easy to talk to. No real complaints there. He gives really good feedback to expand your argument, however I feel that sometimes he may encourage too much out of us. Useful for brainstorming but at times it was hard to incorporate into my 6 page draft. Overall, if you are a STEM–y minded person taking Phys 16 and Math 55 as well, I would avoid taking this expos as it's literally a version of Hum10 where you do not have to read a book every week (with the added bonus of watching a 3 hour movie in Japanese in 2 days (it was good tho ngl)). If you are looking to challenge yourself, or are a really humanities sort of person and want to dive off into the deep end and don't have space for Hum10 in your schedule, would highly recommend.",

The content is also super interesting; coming into Harvard as a middle class student, I was pretty critical of my affluent peers. However, after taking this class, I learned how to navigate discussions about class, how it affects every single aspect of life, and how different classes deal with their handling of wealth.

As time went on I felt more and more comfortable participating, and confident in my writing ability. The readings were interesting and I learned a lot about military history which I knew pretty much nothing about prior to taking this course. Also Dr Monaghan is really intelligent and witty and she gives useful feedback!I should note, the course policies are strict when it comes to formatting citations, lateness, having an incoherent thesis, going over the word count etc. Each of these mistakes committed in your draft will result in 1/3 of a letter grade deduction from your final revision grade (even if the final revision does not contain any of these mistakes). This should not be an issue if you are a very meticulous or organized person (I however am not, so I often received grade deductions)I would not recommend this class to anyone who wants a completely stress free, low–effort introduction to academic writing. When I compare my experiences in Expos to that of my friends in other classes, we were expected to fulfil higher quality standards for the same grade, and we also had more assignments (3 Units compared to 2 for many other classes + more readings + more regular homework assignments). I remember one of my friends laughing and telling me \"I feel like you are always writing papers\". I am a decent writer, and I like dissecting complex topics. However, this is NOT an \"easy A\" class, especially if you are not someone who enjoys reading and writing and is only planning on taking STEM courses at Harvard.That being said, take this class if you want to learn more about military history, feel well prepared for essay writing in the humanities, and learn how to write clear and effective essays.

      "This class is structured like any other Expos class; however, the grading is slightly (emphasis on the slightly) harsher. Dr Pietras has high expectations for the three papers (which most Expos classes have, too), though it is not overly difficult. There are both easier and more difficult expos classes (in my opinion). Despite this, I would recommend this course as the topic (Queer Coming of Age Stories) made the class more enjoyable. All the media we analyzed had more of a personal connection. Understand that this is not a class about your own queer narrative, though (if you are queer). This is an analytical class that looks at novels and films consisting of queer characters. For me, this was a relief as someone was still discovering their own identity. The topic also fosters as strong community, so you can expect to meet some phenomenal classmates. This makes class discussions way more enjoyable as we had inside jokes and goofy moments. Dr. Pietras also did a great job leading class discussions, keeping us on pace, and offering assistance during office hours and over email. Personally, I feel like my writing has improved in this class. If you take it, though, please don't procrastinate the papers until the day of. It makes life truly miserable... this is true for any Expos class. Overall: I would recommend as Expos is mandatory (plus the topic is fun for this course). Dr. Pietras' feedback is mostly helpful, too, and his grading (while harsh) is overall fair. You will know what is expected of you. Note to my fellow queer students who are not completely out yet: Be aware that you are essentially outing yourself to fellow students in your grade since Expos topics are a common conversation topic/starter during your first year. If you are not completely out, please keep this in mind as you are bound to be asked countless times what Expos you are taking.",

      "I've compared my workload with that of my peers, and this is definitely one of the more manageable Expos courses (only 3 papers).  Dr. Q is an incredible professor who often facilitates engaging discussions about current world issues and their connection to psychology.  If you are remotely interested in psych, you will like the conversations made in this course.  While there are readings assigned, discussions occasionally go off–topic, so not all readings are thoroughly covered.  However, do prioritize the readings she emphasizes, as the first two papers is based on it.  By the end of the course, we had built a strong sense of community.

      "Parts of this class were amazing. I found the material super interesting if you are at all science–inclined (looking at you pre–meds) or even want to question how academic material is communicated to people without a highly educated background. We also did a ton of museum trips and speaker visits, which were all very low–stress, purely interest–fulfilling outings. I especially loved the museum trips because we got a behind–the–scenes view of Harvard, which was great for my first semester here. Emilie Raymer is an absolutely wonderful and sweet human being. She was super accommodating when people were sick or needed extensions or anything of the sort. Overall, this class was much easier than most of my friends' Expos. The final paper, being a capstone project, also came in quite handy during finals season.Some cons of this class: the reading was super heavy at the beginning (upwards of 200+ pages in two days), and it was challenging for me to learn how to read efficiently as someone who didn't have a lot of long, academic reading experience in high school. Additionally, with the pro of it being a relatively easy class, there was the negative that it didn't push me to become a better writer. We didn't do a ton (if any) of additional assignments or receive additional feedback besides our essay drafts. While this meant less graded work overall, it also meant I didn't really note any improvements in my writing overall. So if you're looking for a low–stress, interesting Expos and already feel confident in your writing abilities, this might be the one for you.",

      "Don't come into this expos expecting an extremely easy class––as with all expos, when you have an essay due, workload tends to pile up. HOWEVER, don't let this deter you from taking this class either. At least this semester, we visited the Art Museum, and the Collection of Scientific Instruments, and the Learning Lab, which were all really interesting (and I haven't seen a lot of other expos classes do this). I think the best part was the guest speakers that came in––everything that they would talk about would relate directly to the essay you had to write for the unit, so it helped in that aspect, but the topics they would talk about would also just be so engaging and mind–opening, and you would learn a lot of things that you would not be able to in other classes!For the first two essays, there are a lot of readings, but this also forces you to internalize the most important parts of the readings and really grasp the speaker's purpose, which helps you set up your arguments for your essays. The amount of readings greatly decreases after the first two months after you move into the Capstone project, and this Capstone project (at least for this class this year) builds off your second essay. I would say that the topics this class touches on are pretty niche and in my opinion, very interesting to talk about––the ethics behind scientific communication, the balance between scientific objectivity and audience relevance, the difficulty of bridging value systems in crisis communications. In fact, I think if you are a STEM concentrator thinking of going into research, this expos really sets you up well for stuff you will face in the future. However, besides the first essay, which I overall had fun writing just because it concerned Hubble Space Telescope images, these topics are pretty painful to write about. It definitely requires a lot of thinking, drafting/redrafting, and revisions just so you can continue to keep your writing clear but also contain the nuance that this class requires/Professor Raymer is looking for. Professor Raymer really emphasizes including some kind of nuance into your argument for all your essays––your thesis needs to address the question/essay prompt but there is often an additional thing she is looking for, such as scope or application. One thing I wish I did more of this semester if I had the time was go up to her after class (or during her office hours) to talk about my essays outside of the designated feedback time––Professor Raymer really goes out of her way to look and give suggestions on specific questions you have about your writing, and she is also pretty lenient on extensions! You will be able to get more constructive feedback on your essay. Overall, I had fun in this class––it definitely isn't ideal when you have an essay on a relatively hard topic to tackle and a midterm in the same week, but everybody in the class was so smart and fun to talk to, and I made some really good friends, so it made up for it! Professor Raymer is also very kind. If you are willing to handle the slightly heavier workload/more stressful drafting process in exchange for learning and discussing about some pretty cool things and relevant issues, take this class!",

      "GEM!! very light workload (no graded assignments other than the three main papers and a few very minor ones for completion points), feedback is very accessible, grading is fair (everyone I know either got an A or A– on paper one), easy to get extensions, readings are always recapped during class so you don't have to do them beforehand or can just skim them, topic is super interesting and relevant, and Jane is super understanding and helpful, especially during writing conferences. And added bonus, taking expos with mostly stem concentrators is a major hack because no one really liked writing so the standards were definitely lower. I think you should at least have some genuine interest in generative AI to enjoy it though. Nothing negative I can really say about it. Take it!!"

Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, or a meat lover, this course makes you explore animal rights, why politicians are hesitant to talk about meat, factory farming, the future of food in the world, and many other topics.

While the class is not horribly hard it also is not a gimme, but you'll have a lot of fun and learn a lot about film, about persona, and about your own outlook on the world and how you and other people present themself, which is a cool thing to think about and be aware of.",

      "I didn't write many papers like this in high school, they were limited to the kind of work I did in competitions outside of school. That being said, I did write essays but they were non–academic. Coming into Expos 20 was something I enjoyed, but didn't find too challenging because I enjoy writing. I think Dr Sweeney had a forgiving syllabus planned out that contributed to why it wasn't too challenging, but still provided something I had to struggle a little with. TAKE THIS COURSE IF:1. You enjoy sentimental fiction! As a new course, this is effectively what sold me on this Expos. I enjoy sentimental books and films – and if you like romcoms! we analyse one at the end of the class. I think being someone who genuinely appreciates this type of literature just guarantees you'll enjoy the course a lot more. 2. Our readings were: Uncle Tom's Cabin, then 3 films – Philadelphia, Fruitvale Station, and You've Got Mail.  My 9am section watched these films together and had a cute little watch party, so recommend to repeat! 3. You want lots of feedback on your papers – Dr Sweeney gives great feedback, and lots of it! 4. You want a meaningful struggle for your Expos experience – this class is by no means \"easy\" — you've got to do the readings, read them closely, and engage in class online and offline. This is good flexibility for those who feel nervous about in–class participation. Our Unit 3 essay requires a lot of research too, so it's something you need to want to do and own the process. But I never felt like we had busy work, or work that wouldn't be helpful in some way.The most helpful activities in this class were (1) the workshops where we all read 1–2 peoples' essays and gave feedback on it, and having my essay chosen for the workshop and experiencing both being the person giving and receiving feedback was a good experience. I got to ask many people how to fix things I thought were problems, and really get solutions. Shoutout to my classmates for being amazing people too and giving good feedback <3 I also thought that the Perusall comments on each other's essay was a great way of getting very specific feedback, and it helped me identify problems in my essay I wouldn't have thought of resolving otherwise. (2) is the model essay review e.g. in Unit 1 we looked at another essay about the Great Gatsby, and in Unit 3 we compared and contrasted academic papers' introductions. I think this was helpful for building a sense of \"what good looks like\" so we had something to work towards. Being able to read my classmates' papers also provided a sense of what I'm doing, and made my work feel less in a vacuum where I don't know how good or bad it is. READINGS: I thought the progression of readings for this course was relatively well organised. Unit 1 started out a little lighter and shorter with the excerpt from Fisher's essay, which was genuinely really interesting and a text we could have discussions about. Applying it to Obama's speeches was something I did not expect, but I think that made it a good example of a lens essay, and taught me that I could indeed use seemingly 'unrelated' lenses in my writing, helping me see connections maybe I otherwise wouldn't have. The amount of reading was in the ballpark of 20~ pages per week plus analysis. The fact that Fisher's work related to our Unit 2 readings of Uncle Tom's Cabin was also a strategic choice, I think it primed me to read the novel through a more sentimental lens. Reading the whole novel on such a short timeline and with the level of attention required was indeed challenging, but it was made a bit easier since we only had to close–read specific chapters. I really appreciated that caveat; and it made the workload a bit more manageable. At most, this was ~100+ pages per week. Unit 2 was pretty intense reading–wise, because we had the novel, and also two lengthy academic papers to read. Brodhead and Noble's essays, I will say, were stimulating. Reading the whole novel also gave me adequate authority to write on our topic, and I think the library trip also provided more context and nuance which made me feel more knowledgeable about refuting claims made by Brodhead or Noble. Whilst it was a LOT to read and review, I'm not sure I would change anything about them. Unit 3 had recommended readings for the films we watched, and I think they were also useful. So... great job Dr Sweeney! I can't think of any readings that weren't very useful or didn't challenge my thinking about our source material. Generally, no changes I'd suggest to Dr Sweeney except to maintain the workshops, and the segment where he picked out good/bad sentences or grammatical errors to share from all the drafts helped too!I think with Unit 3, some of the class segments on plagiarism and citations could have been shortened a little and replaced with more time picking apart each others' papers or even other academic essays. I liked the excercise we did ranking the different academic papers' use of sources, and analytical question.",

Professor Turley creates an environment where everyone feels like their voice can be heard, and although it started out a little stiff, we had some great laughs by the end of our class.

      "This is a great expos if you enjoy philosophy. I like philosophy of language and of meaning, and as a result the chance to read Frege, Wittgenstein, Grice, Putnam etc. was a wonderful opportunity, and we really got to get into the texts in question. Professor Willison very clearly knows what he's talking about with regards to these texts and it was really wonderful gaining a greater appreciation of them. I also felt that the workload of the course was very reasonable, with it consisting mostly of reading responses to each of the readings to hold us to account on the readings and then structured work on the three essays. The classes themselves are mostly very engaging, with a lot of student led discussion (although sometimes so much that it felt a bit unguided, but this was not often that big an issue).  One thing I will warn however: if you don't have an interest in philosophy of meaning, the readings can get very dense at times and at those times it is very hard to stay motivated unless you have an active interest in the material, so if you do not enjoy philosophy – especially if you don't like things that don't seem to have immediate practical relevance to the real world in some sense – then the course might not be as interesting for you. I still think that Professor Willison does a good job of making it interesting and giving you reason to care, but if that's not your area of interest I don't think it makes too much sense to place this that high up on the expos lottery,",
      "I would strongly advise you against taking this course. Unless you absolutely love philosophy and are ready for grad level readings, you probably won't enjoy this class (even if you are a philosophy lover you still might not enjoy this class because it is poorly organized)I think the material of this course was so challenging that it felt extremely difficult to really grow as a writer. Expos is meant to be a writing class taught through the vehicle of some other field. In this class however, the philosophy is the focus. I could see this class being a philosophy course for philosophy concentrators, not an expos class. He told us on the first day that this class would cover grad level material, which again does not make sense considering this is an introductory writing class.Additionally the lack of quality feedback and difficulty communicating with the professor made it extremely difficult to find direction in the course and grow as a writer (his feedback was usually incredibly vague, and he rarely replied to emails).On top of everything else, things were incredibly poorly organized. The professor would forget to put assignments on canvas, or would randomly change due dates.",

The grading is quite strict. I would also recommend that anyone who likes continental philosophy and is attracted to this course make sure that they like analytical philosophy too. Or try reading some of the texts on the syllabus. With that being said, I think Professor Styles is a good professor who cares about his students and class a lot. I wish he spent more time in class explaining the confusing parts of philosophy of language. But his feedback was always very detailed, if nitpicky at times.

      "Take this expos course! It is by far the best expos course out there, trust. I heard lots of other freshmen who hated their expos. For me, it was one of the most fun courses of the semester (and I am not a huge fan of writing/reading). The topic is very interesting and you will find the readings engaging and sometimes even entertaining. Assignments are not too long: there is a short writing assignments for every sections (really no big deal), in addition to the three main unit assignments. The first two unit assignments are the comparative essay and the research essay, like most expos courses, but the third one consists in turning your research essay into an op–ed of 750 words! But the main reason why you should take this course is Taleen, the instructor. She is just an amazing teacher, one of the best I have ever had. Her feedback is so valuable, and she is a pretty fair grader (she will acknowledge the effort you put in your essay in the final grade). Her classes are so interesting and she is so good at making everyone feel welcomed and respected. It is no surprise that her sections soon became one of my (and lots of my classmates') favorite moments of the week. Also, she will bring you to several different visits, for example one was at the Arts Museum. Another one was at the Bok Center, where each of us filmed the trailer (yes, the trailer!) for our research essay. It was a conciseness exercise in the view of our final project (op–ed). It was one of the most amazing experiences since I have been here. Please make yourself a favor and take this course!!!",

This was a really supportive space to practice.– I learned from hearing other people's speeches what I liked and what I didn't and that helped with my own speeches.– I appreciated the feedback I got from other students. – Super easy.Cons:– Nick cancelled so many classes. They were for valid reasons, but he always did it at like 11pm the night before class, and it was always the night before a speech day, so the people who were meant to give a speech that day didn't know when they were meant to give their speech instead, and it was all just very confusing. It would have been nice to have more notice. The class was so disorganized.– I actually didn't find Nick's feedback helpful. He would tell us to do things like work on our footwork, but he never explained what good footwork looked like. I also often disagreed with what he told my classmates about their speeches, so I didn't necessarily put so much stock in his comments.– I didn't find the exercises we did in between our speeches (like the improv speeches) useful. The topics we did were super random (talk about your favorite meal), and I didn't like the structure we used. I think we could have done much more useful things (answer the question \"tell me about yourself\" in a job interview, elevator pitch a project you're working on...)My recommendation: take expos 40 with a different preceptor",

      "If you are interested in climate change, global change, ecology, forests, carbon, or the history of New England's landscape, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!This is by far one of the best and most interesting classes I have ever taken! Besides the extremely interesting content of the class, the class itself was an incredible experience. You get to go to the forest, stay in a really nice house, and bond with 9 other students for a whole weekend, three times throughout the semester. These weekends served as extremely nice and relaxing breaks from the rest of the semester, and I still got a lot of work done for other classes at night while there. The group was great and had some of the nicest people I've met on campus, and since you will all share similar interests if you are in this class, there are endless things to talk about with the group. I personally found some great friends in the class, people who I will hopefully stay close with throughout the rest of my 4 years at Harvard. Additionally, as for the class itself, it was the best learning environment I have ever seen in a class. It provided an extremely immersive learning environment where we were enabled not only to be much more interested in what we learned, but we could have a dialogue about each topic and ask further questions about things that were not necessarily pointed out to us, since we were in an immersive environment where our own observations were appreciated and adapted into the fluently shifting yet curriculum–based conversations. We got to see real, clear evidence of global change, learn why and how it happened, and how it can be mitigated or better understood through experiments that were occurring. The content was super interesting and I had some great conversations with Dave and the rest of the class about climate change and just anything that came up in conversation. It really helped me to see that there absolutely is a lot we can do about climate change, and inspired me even more to pursue research in my future. I think I understand global change, forests, and ecology much more than ever before as a result of this class, as there is just so much content, and it is provided in a very digestible and engaging manner.Dave is also great and such a knowledgeable guy, and is typically able to answer just about any question that the students ask him. I truly encourage all to apply for and take this course, it was seriously the best class I had this semester and an incredible introduction to Harvard.",

      "Take this course if you're interested in history/humanities and medicine at all! I think this course is great for those who even have a slight interest in these fields, but I will say, that this course made me realize that I am not interested in humanities. Although the surgical aspects were interesting, I felt uninterested in many of the readings, especially the earlier ones. If you're not interested in humanities or history at all, I wouldn't recommend this course, but if you are, and are considering pre–med or simply have an interest in medicine, I definitely would recommend this seminar. Most of the readings aren't bad, but some can be like 20+ pages. I don't recommend skipping out on the readings as without reading, you won't be able to participate in discussion and it feels so awkward while a few of the students who actually did the reading are speaking and engaging in discussion with the professor while you are silent and don't have anything to add. I do recommend skimming most of the readings, especially if they're long. As long as you have a general idea of the subjects, you'll be able to add to the discussion, so skimming is fine in my personal opinion. I know other students who went overboard and read everything and took notes, but I didn't do all of that and was still able to participate. I would say try to do the readings a day or two before class so you don't forget the topics on the day of class. You can also take notes during the readings, but I didn't. The papers are not bad (the first one is a 5–paragraph essay and the second is a 3–5 page double–spaced essay + presentation) and Dr. Milham provides useful feedback on your writing. I really enjoyed the field trips we went on to Countway Library and Harvard Medical School's anatomy lab.  Honestly, as long as you pay attention in this course and skim the readings, you'll be fine. This is essentially a very low–commitment seminar with fun field trips and a great professor!",

Professor Friedman is an incredibly warm–hearted, caring professor who continues to inspire me with his passion for the natural sciences. One thing to know, however, is that this class is more focused on Charles Darwin himself than evolutionary biology and could somewhat feel like a history of science course too. The workload is not the lightest, as the readings can be quite long and sometimes dense. But as someone who loves nature/evolutionary bio, I really enjoyed the readings, especially Darwin's On the Origin of Species.

It's something I really did not really comprehend that well coming in, but one thing to note about seminars is that you really should take them only if your already interested in the subject or have an interest in learning more about it/discovering it. I think, knowing that, it can make your experience with this work–heavy seminar more enjoyable. In the end however, all seminars are pass fail so don't stress yourself out. It is a lot of work but a workload that comes from a passion to learn and complete it not to retain a perfect GPA. All in all, this seminar is great for just exploring and knowing more about microbiology and symbiosis, a topic that doesn't get a lot of focus seemingly. Every class we'd go over the chapter of the microbiology book we read and completed a short 200 written assignment on. After that, kids would usually give out presentations concerning whatever independent research review on the newest microbiology discoveries were (usually had a written assignment reading like 2 to 3 research papers to gain background info). Then class would end with some food or like a trip to the lab to dissect. Seminar filled with fun field trips and amazing people. Prof Cavanaugh is so funny, not in a haha way but in like a conversational mishap way. You will be called out if your not paying attention/didn't do your work though. Overall, would really recommend. Lots of work for high reward. The microbiology I learned in this class was literally useful in my other biology courses and something I'll take with me throughout my career and how I think about health and biology.",

      "Complexity has set the bar for humanities at Harvard incredibly high. This is the most transformative and enlightening academic experience I have ever had, and I doubt that it can be surpassed (though I wholeheartedly hope that it will). I cannot recommend this class enough. I mean it. I do not know how to convey just how much I loved this course. I cannot be more grateful to have ended up in this class – it's the best thing that has happened to me academically and I will do my best to convey why it is such a special course.Complexity realizes the full potential of what a First Year Seminar can be. A First–Year Seminar is a pass/fail course, which means that you should treat the course as if the grade was completely irrelevant. For some, it may mean that you can put in a minimal amount of work to get by. If this is what you expect, you should consider another course. Not having a lettered grading scale offers the opportunity for you to learn for the sake of learning: there is no upper limit to how much work you can put into this course. There is no assurance of \"having done enough\" that an \"A\" offers. This is a class where how much you put in is how much you get out of it. I mean this in the best sense possible – as long as you are willing to put in the work, there is simply no limit to the amount of intellectual gratification you can get out of this course. That's why I appreciated this course so much. I spent an average of ten hours per week on this course; it is my biggest time commitment of the term. I can say that every single ounce of effort I put into it was worth it. My point is that you should take this course if and only if: 1) you are passionate about the content, 2) you are willing to learn for the sake of learning, and 3) you are willing to put a lot of work into it because you enjoy learning.What makes Professor Fisher and Complexity phenomenal is his willingness to treat you as an intellectual equal and his care. From the very first week of class, the guiding questions were complex and they never stopped being complex. One can build a course based on the questions listed in each week's handout alone. Professor Fisher does not dumb down the content so that you can understand; he presents Hamlet and Ulysses in their full complexity and thereby illustrates their greatness and their full interpretative potential. Each weekly lecture was the highlight of my week. Professor Fisher cares a lot about the content, and he gets you to care, too. I would always walk away feeling ineffably inspired, even if I had spent the night before writing my response paper until 5 AM. The lectures were so engaging and for the lack of a better term, so, so, so intellectually stimulating. It is truly a privilege to be able to take this course, and knowing that this course has ended makes me feel very sad.Professor Fisher also provides very helpful feedback on your weekly response papers. His detailed annotation of my weekly response papers motivated me to push myself to write better and gave me the critical perspective I needed to do so. That alone makes taking the course worth it. Furthermore, I have also gained so many invaluable insights into literature and into what I want to do with my undergraduate years from talking to him during his office hours. Again, I cannot overstate my appreciation.As a cherry on top, you will also be reading Hamlet and Ulysses, some of the greatest works of art ever created. I had no idea what Ulysses was before I started and I will never regret reading it. But if I hadn't read it with the guidance of this course, I do not think I would have been able to get nearly as much out of it as I did; Ulysses is, as Professor Fisher says, a scholarly book that is best read in an academic setting. If anything I said resonates with what you want academically, you should take this class.",

      "I think this course is absolutely incredible for people who are truly passionate about the federal response to climate change, but I do think that it is designed for a certain type of student to succeed, and if you don't necessarily fit the mold, I would hesitate to dedicate one of your four freshman class slots to this. I think a good number of my classmates and I who had originally had some level of interest in economics and the environment found themselves falling behind as the number of regulations and concepts we covered piled up. The pace at which the course moves is extremely fast for the complexity of the topics we were covering, and I think that if you didn't take your free time to understand the content outside of class/have the passion going in, you wouldn't have the background knowledge needed to truly contribute during class discussions. The majority of this course is structured around two student presentations per class, with each covering an extremely timely but also complex area of federal environmental regulation. I'm glad I took this course because I think I would've always wondered what I would've learned otherwise, but I do think it showed me that a career in environmental economics is not the right fit. I think before getting into this course, it's important to know that the whole point of the course is to get DEEP into the weeds about environmental regulation (e.g., how credits and offsets are verified, the 45 series of tax credits fro the IRA, etc.) –– if that's what you're looking for, then I wholeheartedly recommend this course!! If you're looking for just a broad–level understanding of U.S. climate policy though, I think this course might not exactly fit what you're looking for.",

I like the format of the course: you read challenging material (which you probably don’t understand fully initially) but once class is over, Arthur has made sure that you understand all of it. So, this class really pushes you to read complicated texts without it seeming impossible to understand.Arthur is overall a good professor, but sometimes can get bogged down in details, or feels very passionately about one or two words that we can spend almost an hour analyzing.

In class, there would be multiple people on their computers that didn't contribute to discussions, and only a fraction of the class would actually be engaged. With a different group of students, I think that this course could be significantly better, but this year, it felt more like a lecture class compared to an actual seminar. I still don't know most of the other students well, which I feel should be a key part of first year seminars. In addition, some of the readings were dry and technical, and the class has a large focus on how LLMs work—which was somewhat helpful for context but also took away time from discussing the implications of AI in science. However, this class has a relatively light workload, mostly 10–20 page readings/annotations per week. Brendan is also an incredibly knowledgeable professor and has years of experience in the field. While he was a bit pessimistic at time, his insight was extremely interesting. I also found the final project quite fun.

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!Genuinely, this was my favorite course of my 1st semester here at Harvard. Professor Wilson is truly an expert on this topic, while also being an incredibly kind and caring instructor. No matter what your background, you will gain such an in–depth, nuanced, and evidence–based view of not only the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also Cold War / modern geopolitics and nuclear strategy. You will also learn a lot about how to \"think like a historian.\" Many of the readings are fascinating primary documents. Workload: Quite reasonable while also motivating fascinating in–class discussions –– expect a couple of readings per week, as well as a 1–paragraph \"after–action report\" due 24 hours after each course meeting. During weeks that are particularly busy, Prof. Wilson is very accommodating in adjusting the workload accordingly. Discussions: Truly the best part of this class.  Professor Wilson was excellent in creating an environment in which we could express our views on the very controversial topic of nuclear weapons. I particularly appreciated that he did not impose his own views upon us students, but rather provided us with evidence that supports multiple viewpoints and let us come to our own opinions on the basis of this evidence and respectful and deep discussion with our classmates.  In my opinion, he truly epitomizes what it means for a professor to facilitate and encourage intellectual vitality. Final Project: A wonderful opportunity to put everything you've learned to use, while getting to be creative and explore an area that is particularly interesting to you. Office hours are a great way to talk over your ideas with Professor Wilson and get his feedback and advice.  On the last day, you will give a brief presentation to the class, while enjoying ice cream and cookies! Overall, if you are even remotely interested in any field related to foreign policy, politics, or history, take this course!!",
      "Professor Wilson is a great teacher and is skilled at leading discussions. I was particularly struck by how Nuclear Dilemmas was the course I was in with (by far) the most diversity of ideological opinion, but that discussion still managed to stay constructive throughout. The topic and readings were also fascinating, albeit extremely depressing.

They also provide a reasonable amount of reading per week.There is really only so much you can do to prepare for or understand these fundamental spiritual questions, but this class will definitely make you wiser and more prepared to face them.I came in with a religious background (Christian) and I found that this class deepened my understanding of my own faith.

      "If you have any interest at all in how language works, I would really recommend taking this course. It gives you an introduction to a lot of linguistics without the stress of a graded course, and the professor takes advantage of that lack of pressure to be very exploratory in his approach to the subject and allow all sorts of different viewpoints on how language operates to be heard in class. The readings are also phenomenally interesting, with them speaking to very deep and fascinating facts about language. As a math/logic oriented person, I found the formal aspects of the course particularly interesting, but there were also sections that were particularly interesting to the sociolinguists in the class, so there was a good mix. Professor Chierchia is wonderful; he very clearly cares a lot about his students and is deeply excited to speak to people interested in his subject and make the seminar a welcoming space for them, by organising optional out of class events, making himself eminently available for questions and help, and giving everyone a chance to speak in class. The class is structured around student led presentations of the reading topics each week followed by the Professor going a bit deeper and then a freeform discussion, which in my view takes advantage of the seminar structure quite effectively. This is a general theme – Professor Chierchia takes advantage of the less stressful structure of a seminar course to take a very exploratory, curious approach to the class that I feel is very good at sparking your interest. I will definitely be coming back to the materials from this course several times in future, they are incredibly interesting. The class also just puts a lot of interesting questions in your mind I feel.",

As a writer, I was exposed to so many new ideas, conventions, styles, and ideas, that I otherwise would have never known about (especially since a lot of these novellas are translated works!) As a reader, I'm thankful I got the opportunity to practice incorporating reading time into my weekly schedule (I hope to continue my reading schedule next semester too).  The course *can* feel stressful if you put off your reading until the last minute, but generally, Prof. Bolton is very understanding and kind. He genuinely wants to make this course an enjoyable experience for his students and does not want to make your life more stressful than it already is. You can always feel free to reach out about anything if need be. I should also mention that he is a very thoughtful person in general; as the course went on, I felt like he genuinely got to know me and he was always telling me about different events or books about topics I had previously told him I was interested in.

He is a really intelligent person and has a stupendous vocabulary.The course offered fascinating discussions on topics like the history of the internet and its future, particularly around real–world issues like online regulation. However, there is a seemingly strong pre–law focus that wasn’t immediately clear when I signed up and might not appeal to students looking for a broader exploration of online conduct beyond legal frameworks. Additionally, the small class size (10–15 students) sometimes led to an imbalance in knowledge levels, which could make discussions harder for less experienced students. With that said, if you do the readings you will be fine for the vast majority of the material discussed.The grading system was sat./unsat., with blog posts on current events and a final paper. This low–pressure structure encouraged participation and was really stress–free, but I would have liked there to be an option for it to be graded. Also, the focus on copyright, patents, and trademarks, while important, sometimes overshadowed other aspects of internet policy, making the course feel a bit one–sided.All critiques I made are very minor though, I had a really positive experience. Overall, I gained a much deeper understanding of the internet's legal landscape and its implications for the future. This is an awesome, one–of–a–kind class and a great seminar!",

It was also a great way to balance out my workload in my first semester here. The readings in this class weren't discussed very in depth and they were mostly used to frame weekly discussions that were mainly reflections from our own lives as they related to the different topics. If you are willing to get personal during discussions and are even remotely interested in developmental psychology or your own transition to adulthood, then I would recommend this seminar.",

Nicole is so wonderful and does her best to set you up well for your first semester of college by introducing you to resources you may not have known about (such as the Learning Lab) and facilitating connections between you and your classmates. The class covers three movements (desegregation, DREAMers, and gun violence prevention), and features several activist/historian guest speakers as well as a field trip to East Boston High School. While the readings are definitely comprehensive, Nicole tries to format them in a way where you can listen/read while doing other things, so it doesn't feel like as much work. It is clear how much she cares about us as people and wants to make sure we are successful. The class is super discussion–based and I got to know and love everyone else in our section.

There is a fair bit of reading each week (some weeks a book a week), but it is always manageable. I also know that if for some reason you are not able to finish the work for the week or you are struggling just in general, Professor de la Fuente is understanding and really cares for all of his students as people. He is always available to meet with students and even if you can't make it to his offices hours, he'll make an effort to schedule another time to meet. In terms of the actual material, while at times it can be tough, it is incredibly important and you will learn so much. It is an interesting class and approaches race and racism from a perspective that I had ever learned about them from.

Even if you are not into economics or philosophy this is still one of the only classes from which you actually take a way a lot of interesting information. Professor Marglin is such a sweetheart, he brought us apples from his orchard every single class, and was always attentive to what we had to say. He offers awesome feedback and is a unique resource in the economics department. Every class we had interesting perspectives on socialism, and Professor Marglin didn't shy away from listening to contrarian arguments. He also did well in selecting the members of the seminar, and if you want a course where you get to know your classmates really well on an intellectual level this is such a good pick. The readings were moderate in workload, but it is a seminar afterall and their all relevant to studying economics. I think the best thing about this class is the liberty to think and understand the readings, something you don't often see in economics courses that just assume an ideal market.",

The texts tended to feature social/political frameworks to address climate change rather than an economic/scientific approach. While we talked about some forms of geoengineering and economic theories, these were not the central focus of the course and I wish we had lent more attention to them. The weekly seminars sometimes felt like we were simply summarizing the readings rather than applying the text to broader scenarios. Overall, I would say this course builds a great foundation for understanding climate action through institutional reform/local activism/humanistic scholarship.

There is a substantial amount of reading and daily quizzes, but that is only because this course masterfully is able to consolidate centuries worth of the most dense philosophical material – perfectly into one semester. If you take one GenEd at Harvard let it be this one, you are directly learning how to be a better person and how to live the best life. The final exams are extremely fair and do yourself a favor: do all of the readings (even re–read over breaks) to make sure you've absorbed it all, it will help you in the class and in life!! Moral of the story – 100000% take this class Professor Rinard is the best and Allison Bailin is the best Teaching Fellow, she was incredibly prepared and helpful.",

With that being said, and GENED's starting to become less gemmy across the board, I would still place this on gem status but (in sports terminology) would not be comfortable offering a long term extension of gemminess to this class. Relative to other GENEDs, easier, but more effort required (reading checks, etc.). As a GENED, decent. This class is slightly more annoying than it needs to be. No lecture recordings or slides. Mandatory attendance.",
      "Professor Rinard is the best! She is always connecting the sometimes overly intellectual philosophy topics to real world examples and anecdotes from her life to help our understanding. She was super engaging to listen to and I would highly recommend meeting with her to discuss the topics further; she is a wealth of knowledge. I originally took this class just to get the gened requirement out of the way but ended up truly loving the readings and material I learned. If you do the readings, the quizzes are very easy, and I would definitely call this class a gem. TAKE THIS CLASS even if only to hear Prof. Rinard's interesting and amusing lectures! You won't regret having a deeper understanding of finding fulfillment as a human."

Many of the assignments use the skills you learned and then apply them to the outdoors so you can actually see your understanding of the topic come to fruition. The course derails sometimes into an environmental science and history course, but I personally enjoyed that, and it was fun to learn what Dr. Huth had to offer.

The midterm and exam cover a lot of material and are a lot of memorization, but section presentations are very helpful for honing in on what you need to study. I really enjoyed lecture and was always engaged with notes, which helped in my studying. Rich tells fascinating stories from his practice, and is very knowledgeable in all the topics he teaches about. I also really enjoyed the healthy living challenge and becoming CPR certified. I cannot recommend this GenEd enough!",
      "This gen Ed is fine; it wasn’t too difficult for me as a humanities student, but sometimes it felt a bit like listening to Rich’s left–leaning soapbox on how to live your life. Also be warned if you get grossed out or scared about medical stuff",
      "Take this class if you want a Gem, or if you want to live a long healthy live. Just watch out for the attendance policy. To say it is narcy is an understatement."

Even though I've been at Harvard a while, something about this course made me feel like I hadn't yet learned a single thing in class. What does it mean for humans to be free, and what should we do with our free will? What is faith and should we embark upon it? What kind of a life do you want to have lived when you die? These are the kind of urgent questions we really don't get time to think about, and this class is a great opportunity to engage with some truly creative thinkers on the human condition (Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Sartre were some of my favorites). Courtney and David are also super lovely and sweet people and will take the time to go deeper into any one of the thinkers or course topics if you're interested. Go to office hours. Go to tea. It's nice. :)The course was a fair (as in just) amount of work: ~100 pages of reading a week, but on the bright side, no busywork assignments like discussion posts or weekly responses. Lectures can be hard to follow if you're not used to philosophy but are very rewarding if you pay close attention. The midterm and final are passage ID from the books + short answer questions – very easy if you did the reading and very difficult if you didn't. DO THE READING. If not for the grades, then because the books in themselves are worth reading.Don't be a serious man! Take this class!",

Even if you just take this course as a gened requirement, you will definitely walk away from the course with a better understanding of African spirituality and how it might change our values and views of the world.",
      "The main issue with this course is that it was incredibly disorganized, the most chaotic course I've taken. Granted, it's not a bad course to take if the rest of your courses are tough. But be prepared to deal with the disorganization—for example, the attendance policy, class participation was not set until 5 weeks into the course and we had new policies every week before that. The lectures are also very difficult to follow; the slides do not always match the professor's content and it's hard to understand the content at times.",

There is absolutely no encouragement of differing views in class and if you don't believe that there should be more gun restrictions then your opinion is not valued/asked for. I agree with the majority view BUT I took the class wanting to have more productive conversations with those who are pro–guns and I did not get that at all.

There were a lot of assignments, and some were very time consuming, but the creative assignments were such a nice change of pace. They allowed me to think in a way I hadn't in so long and I really appreciated that. There is a lot of reading, but all of the readings are wonderful and I just appreciated this class so so much. It is the best Gen–Ed you'll get here by FAR! Please take!!",
      "Not a breeze, but super doable as a lighter 4th class. Your experience will totally depend on your TF (Hannah is the absolute best!!!)",
      "This GENED is a prime example of why the GENED system is broken. Every week, a hundred students trudge in to sit in lecture and do other work with some rambling as background ambient noise. This might literally be a study hall for homework.Now Greg is a sweetheart and obviously an expert at what he does, but he also looks like he personally knew some of the Greek heroes back in the day. So, the main teaching is mostly left to the TFs, who are EXTREMELY hit or miss. I have heard of several people enjoying their sections, but for the most part, they are pretentious, snotty, sleep–deprived, burnt–out grad students trying to force a group of uninterested, busy undergrads to yap about some incoherent analysis.Also, if Hannah is a TF, AVOID HANNAH AT ALL COSTS—this woman is literally the words pedantic, neurotic, and main–character syndrome come to life. Every time she co–led class, an audible groan could be heard from the auditorium, and whenever she was involved in lecture, it was a circus of Hannah imagining herself a deep intellectual and emanating cringe at nuclear levels.That being said, the course is still definitely a gem—like actually close to zero workload. There are a lot of little assignments, but they’re things you can grind out in a couple of minutes, and the quizzes are extremely doable just by skimming through the reading. Genuinely, the most time I ever spent on this outside of class was like an hour.So if you need a gem to balance out your schedule, take it. But if you have any self–respect or want to avoid the grievance of observing the carnival of insufferable people this course for some reason attracts—don’t do it."

When he played his electric guitar in class.

It's so important that everyone gets the chance to learn more about what is happening along the US–Mexico border, because it is so close to us but the experiences of people along the people are so different. Dr. Soto Laveaga is so kind, and her lectures are super engaging. She's very passionate about the material, which makes lecture very enjoyable. She's really good at storytelling, so you will not get bored. The TFs are awesome too, and the assignments are very interesting (interviewing someone for an oral history project, map assignment, film analysis). Also, a lot of what we learned in class can be applied to other border issues around the world. These issues are very relevant, and this course is a good way to expand your worldview. The workload is pretty manageable, and everything is very intentional –– not a lot of busy work. Highly recommend.",

Puett is a wonderful lecturer, but not having lecture slides nor recordings made it a challenge to revisit topics if I didn't quite catch them the first time around. The course staff were understanding and always helpful – shout out Isa for being a great section leader. Section material was a little lacking as well. Assignments gave a lot of freedom to explore the philosophy however you wanted, which I think is a strength of this class. A creative final project is also a super interesting way to engage with the material. Weekly section reflections often feel like busy work, but they're not too bad. Having certain components graded on completion also takes some of the pressure off. Fair warning, however, the A grade is set at >95%, so prepare to lock in a little. Feedback was okay. Section conversations were often lively and interesting debates. With two essays, a final project, weekly readings and section reflections, this class is a decent amount of work for a gened but nothing crazy. I genuinely do think the texts give you a unique perspective and are worth reading, engaging with, and applying to the real world. This class helps you do that, and for that alone I think it is a worthwhile gened to take. The other good things, including the course staff, are just the cherry on top.",

My overarching issue with the course is the vast material it tries to cover, the sheer content, and how some of the information presented to us was not done with an underlying thesis or takeaway. I will present my opinions in bullet–point format, addressing both information for prospective students and recommendations for how I would’ve better walked away from the class.– The number of readings: I know they’ve already mentioned to us that they tried to cut it down, but still, it is a lot. Again, I am totally okay with a lot of reading (I’m a social studies concentrator). But this is a Gen Ed and supposed to be, to some degree, at an introductory level. By providing the amount of readings and their length each week (4–6, with many over 20 pages), it was an information overload. It was width, not depth. I only memorized readings for the exams, and I’m sure I’ll forget most by this time next year. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: keep it to 2 a week or 1 book for two weeks. Each week, the readings could include a twenty– to thirty–page academic paper or journal article followed by a 5–10–page journalistic or media article that offers a countering perspective, nuance, or another angle. This would allow students to really be able to read the material better, more effectively use them on the exams, and actually get into the depth of their corresponding and ongoing conversations in academia. Moreover, the arguments raised could more effectively be incorporated into the lectures. I believe that you can still teach the basics of American society and public policy by going through and weighing arguments and showing how they build them with first principles. And if you’re concerned about students not doing the readings, add a discussion post component that is 100–250 words a week.– Reduce the material covered in lectures: At times, it felt like I was in a high school class being provided a swarm of information on the screen, only for most of it not to be important. For example, when giving context to contemporary issues (while some of the historical information is super interesting), it is overwhelming. Provide just a slide that goes over previous periods and what defined them. I don’t believe there is a need to go over specific laws or specific names of phenomena if you’re not going to test students on it. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: just cut the excess out of lectures or streamline the information that can be streamlined, incorporate and emphasize the most important “bumper–stickers” of the lesson. Have specific, clear, and detailed learning objectives so that students know exactly what to note down, pay attention to, and, most importantly, study for. For example, “causes of inequality” is not a specific enough learning objective; listing out instead “taxation as a contribution to inequality” or things to that effect. This would help students have a better understanding of what they need to learn (and they will then be able to study and reinforce it, as opposed to searching for it and guessing this is the correct thing they are supposed to be studying and coming to find out it is not even remotely mentioned on an exam).– The ID terms were not clearly identified: A key component of how students are evaluated in this course is their ability to write down and memorize key concepts or terms, like laws or sociological principles. However, students were not provided with a list or sort of reference other than simply materials presented in the lectures. This goes back to point (2): how can a student effectively study and learn if they do not know exactly the basic concepts they are going to be tested on? Put simply, the exam is a game of memorization and anticipated questions, and would it not make the most sense to provide a basic pool of terms and concepts that could be selected? Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: give a list of all the IDs that will be covered in each unit. I don’t think it makes sense to only give the ones out that you would put on the exam, but rather all potential ones. This allows students to both better prepare for the actual exam and also go over and learn material that the professors still think is important for them to walk away with. This would make the objectives and results of the course abundantly clear: what I’m supposed to know and be able to talk about professionally, academically, or in my future research.– No clear academic argument or interpretation: I felt as though the lectures were just a list of random facts at times. While there is most certainly a place for just the brass facts, I think each lecture lacked a clear thesis or walkaway. I would have appreciated it if the professors made an academic argument while providing essential information. In this process, they can and should engage and explain other perspectives, but I take a class to get two things: (a) new information and (b) a scholar's interpretation of that information. Now, I can still come to my own conclusions, but at least I am aware of how academics in the field are thinking about the topic and understand the evidence or information they’re using to come to these conclusions. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: think about the overarching argument I am giving in the lecture, how I can present the basic concepts, information, or background information essential to understanding the debate, and highlight other scholars' opinions and analysis.Overall, while this course benefits from exceptional instructors, passionate teaching, and a wealth of valuable content, its effectiveness is hindered by an overwhelming breadth of material, unclear learning objectives, and a lack of cohesive academic arguments. By streamlining the readings, focusing lectures on key takeaways, providing clear ID terms, and emphasizing overarching theses, the course could better balance depth with accessibility. These adjustments would not only improve the student experience but also ensure that the knowledge gained is more impactful, memorable, and relevant for future academic or professional pursuits.",

      "This is a great course on an overview of climate change and I would recommend it to anyone.  But TREAD CAREFULLY. Dan Schrag is clearly a smart guy but has very strongly held opinions and comes off pretty authoritatively. He is generally pretty receptive to pushback, and especially when you get into policy, his opinions merit pushback. There is a distinct lack of care in the way he talks about communities most vulnerable to climate change, a clear loathing of scientists who he disagrees with (one of who's work he called \"embarassing and premature\" while chuckling), and a clear narrative he tries to paint about the way we should be responding to climate change. One example is a video he showed of a Vanuatu Prime Minister who was preparing his country to leave the islands that were going underwater due to rising seas. He praised this leader, but said NOTHING of many other Pacific Islander communities who were resolved to stay and hold the west to account for their crimes. It is just this one–sidedness to the way he portrays people that he agrees with as incredibly thoughtful, and looks down fiercely on people who disagree with him. Or the way he totally ignores ocean biodiversity as a central backbone of our diet. Or the way he shames communities for living in places that are in climate prone areas. STAY CRITICAL!Take this class and learn the science –– he is great at teaching it. But don't let him shut down your DREAMING or ASPIRING of a better world.  Schrag doesn't have all the answers, nor do it, but the biggest danger of this class is  if you walk away trusting that people like Schrag will take care of the climate. It takes all of us. Bring your creativity and imagination to the course, and don't let Schrag tell you the way the world has to be, just because that is the way the world is now.",
      "Schrag's lecture slides had barely any words on them, so as someone who learns best through reading + audio/visual materials, I found it extremely hard to stay attentive / follow along / know what to write down during lectures. This was pretty frustrating especially when he said everything you need to know is gleanable from just watching lectures, but to prep for the midterm etc, I had to go through lecture recordings to read the captions and figure out a lot of the quite specific numbers, figures, etc. we were expected to memorize :( The reflection + final papers are also quite lengthy (essays are SINGLE spaced, so 6 page single–spaced final paper was actually 12 pages double–spaced LOL). I cannot say I enjoyed this course and especially didn't enjoy its teaching/assignment style, but I have learned a good deal about climate change, energy transition, etc., which has prepared me to be much more informed in future climate–related discussions. Despite the assignments/midterm being a pain, I also think it wasn't too hard to get an A as long as you put in a reasonable effort for the midterm, midterm reflection essay, and final essay (so just 3 points within the semester).",

      "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Sunstein is a truly remarkable person with a remarkable career and life experiences – it was really cool to have him as a lecturer. He is genuinely invested in the students and the content he is teaching.  I think everyone should take this course because it really opens your mind up about how people think – both the logistics and practical nuances as well as more philosophical and personal nuances – which is really important in today's polarized political environment. I genuinely learnt quite a lot about topics and issues I thought I had a good grasp of but that I actually had a pretty one–dimensional view of. The readings were interesting but I highly encourage going to lecture (which is just once a week) and actually paying attention to Professor Sunstein, rather than being on your laptop or doing other work, because his lectures give you a much better understanding of topics and also helps you remember things that you might need to know for the final/midterm. Other than the content though, the actual workload is extremely easy to work with – only 4 discussion posts throughout the entire semester – so you essentially don't really have much work to do during the semester, which I think is great, because then you feel better about setting aside the 2 hours to go to lecture and really focus on the content there because that's where I believe most of the learning lies. The only times you really have to put your head down and work is for the midterm and final (also because they constitute a large part of your grade) but the work for this is also doable. Take this class it's an easy workload but you get a lot out of it in terms of learning!",
      "Wouldn't recommend this course – the midterm is graded unnecessarily harshly.  The final is open for 48hours and requires you to write close essentially allocate 2 full days to it which isn't reasonable in reading period. Lecture can be very boring",

      "This course is as good as it can get for the history gened requirement. The material is really interesting (learning about urban planning / architecture from a historical perspective is probably one of the best ways to learn this material), the assignments are very light and fair (approx one short essay every 3 weeks with a slightly longer final project that you can do in groups), as well as generously graded (at least for me). Bruno definitely has that \"history teacher\" charm in the sense that he captivates me with his lectures every single time (he's also exceptionally passionate about lectures: one time he got down on his knees and started screaming passionately about Bostonian history).My sections were also very fun and not stressful (in the sense that if you were behind on readings you could still participate with general arguments without losing too much). The most fun experience in this class on top of all this was toward the end where we had a scenario planning project that we had to do together as a section. Just discussing with my section how to improve the Church street parking lot and making slides together with everyone was by far the most fun I've ever had in one / two sections. Overall, this is a really good class, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who wants a fun way to fulfill the history requirement.",
      "Gem. But a waste of time if you want to actually learn anything.",
      "this class was great! professor Bruno is amazing and passionate and so are the TFs. Section can be boring but that's typical of any GenEd. The work does pile up at the end but the in class presentation, proposal, and final project but I'd say this class is a gem! Content is interesting and there is a good amount of reading but can 100% get away without doing any reading.

Just based on these guest lectures, this class is incredible.Now, the other half of the class is \"science\" lectures, and this is the aspect that I feel is most lacking.

The guest lecturers would share so much interesting information, offer a demonstration or two, and then it would be disappointing to almost entirely ignore what they shared when we went to lab. The assignments were generally fine, though often there would be some mediocrely written questions that would somehow find their way through. ie questions that were not actually solvable given the material taught in the class, or that were ambiguously formulated in a way that didn't really suggest a way to solve.

      "This class is incredibly interesting, even for someone with no prior background or interest in the topic. I decided to take it after a friend convinced me, and I’m so glad I did! The topics are highly relevant to issues today. Explore the syllabus and see if the topics interest you. If you’re even mildly curious, I think you will really enjoy it. The workload includes one section assignment per week, which usually took me 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. A key tip: start your capstone early! It requires a significant amount of time since you’ll need to write a 2,500–word essay, learn how to use the ArcGIS platform, and format and add visual elements. Both the section assignments and the capstone are engaging and rewarding. The TFs are friendly and helpful, and Jason is an amazing professor—so approachable and kind. If you have the chance, invite him to Classroom to Table! Overall, take this course if you can—you won’t regret it!",
      "I would not recommend this class. The lectures were unengaging and didn't effectively convey much material. I felt like I didn’t learn anything aside from the independent research I did for section assignments and the capstone project. The reading and lecture quizzes seemed intentionally tricky, focusing on minor details that were barely covered, and the grading across assignments was harsh for a GenEd course, so I ultimately had to take it pass/fail. If you’re planning to take a GenEd pass/fail and don’t mind not learning much, this class might work for you since it doesn’t require a significant time commitment if you do take it pass/fail (if not, good luck memorizing every sentence for the quizzes).

      "Take this course!!! Everyone in the teaching team is so wonderful and supportive. The course content itself is also super interesting. The group project was time consuming, but honestly was so cool to work on a research project for the entire semester. The course also dedicates section time to completing the final project, which is honestly so helpful. I also thought it was a super cool chance to learn more about schools in the Boston area. Honestly this was my favorite GENED I've taken at the college—it was the perfect mix of fun and learning in my opinion.",
      "This class is not one that I enjoyed and the description is very misleading. The professor refuses to really acknowledge the issue of race and often times when brought up will cut you off. I noticed a lot of the time in class that students of color were cut off when speaking while non–students of color got to speak for longer periods of time.  This class was extremely disappointing and often had us readings things from groups or people that have no expertise in what the class is about such as Steven Pinker. I would not take this class again.",

      "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!! I came into this course a bit apprehensive because I had never studied Islam or Middle Eastern politics in an academic setting before. However, this became one of my favorite courses that I have ever taken at Harvard (and I'm a senior). The readings are fascinating––they are mostly primary sources written by Islamic scholars. Professor Zeghal is a brilliant and engaging lecturer, and her theories about the relationship between Islam and governance are eye–opening. She is also a very compassionate and understanding professor, and I wish I could take more classes with her. The quizzes went great as long as you did the readings, and being able to drop the two lowest quiz scores alleviated a lot of stress. There was a lot of freedom on the final paper, so we could all choose topics that fascinated us. The final exam was open–note, so as long as you went to class and took notes, you were set! In short, this class was phenomenal (and an awesome way to double–count for Gened and Government requirements!). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

The section primarily focused on his personal beliefs rather than exploring broader perspectives. Additionally, the feedback on written work felt superficial and lacked depth, offering little more than an elementary glance at the content.Also love Professor Zeghal down, as both a professor and just person overall, she is really chil."

I was never interested in film before this, yet this class taught me so much about how to appreciate film and how to view it more analytically, which is something I will carry with me for many years to come.  Professor Zahlten is incredibly knowledgable and passionate; he clearly cares deeply about Japanese cinema and culture/history more generally, and also cares deeply for his students.  The assignments are very reasonable and though sometimes time–consuming, honestly pretty fun; the section component is also fun and ties in well with course concepts.  I really enjoyed the film viewing sessions every Thursday night and actively looked forward to them throughout the week.  This is the rare Gened that actually ended up being one of my favorite classes I've ever taken in college.",
      "I recommend you take this class if you are interested in \"Japanese\" media! The professor is an expert in film, shows, and other media from Japan. The class is mainly about what it means for something to be \"national\" as opposed to \"transnational\" or \"universal.\" So most of the time is spent talking about or considering that one idea. There are also other interesting topics in the readings, but the other main idea is analyzing films from Japan.  The screenings can be a little annoying because of the timing, but it's nothing unmanageable. I really loved the content, so I think this class is worth taking, overlooking the tedious and time–consuming video essay projects.",

In theory this is to encourage people to take notes, but in reality it makes it difficult to actually engage with the content as you are scrambling to take down every word. Typing notes rather than handwriting proved critical in order to actually get all the content and find it later.

You can get by without doing them, but there's no point in taking a class if not to engage with the content. Other than readings there is basically no work assigned except for the take home exams (there's also a creative project, but it was fun and low stress). However, these exams are *long* (ten term definitions and two essays, ~20 pages in total). They're not too difficult, but they're extremely time consuming, and I would much prefer smaller, more frequent assignments instead of two enormous ones.

Through this class, you'll get a holistic understanding of every aspect of climate, from the factors inducing climate change, to the range of disastrous effects, to what we can actually do to solve this problem. Particularly interesting is Professor Anderson's unique perspective on how the most promising thing we can do is to produce accurate and scientifically–backed quantitative forecasts of various climate risks using extremely high quality data collected from balloons / airplanes / spaceships. Indeed, he pioneered a similar approach back in the day and is part of the reason why humanity has essentially solved the ozone crisis.Our class was unique in the sense that there were only ~12 people (because of early registration mishaps), so lectures were full of very illuminating discussions among Professor Anderson and all the students. Sections were also very homey and fun to go to. In terms of work, there were no exams, but instead a few essay / short calculation homeworks plus a big final project. I liked this a lot since the final project gave me a chance to experience what it's really like to do research on an aspect of climate. Overall, this is an amazing gened to fulfill the science requirement and at the same time learn almost all that you can learn about one of the most challenging issues of our time.",

      "Life and Death in the Anthropocene was a really interesting class – the readings were fantastic, and the conversations we had in section were organic and thought–provoking. The course covers a wide range of perspectives on the climate crisis, from different diagnoses of its origin (capitalism, imperialism, religion, etc.) as well as various approaches for solving it (via technology, policy, social change, etc.). This class exceeded my expectations in the sense that people were engaging really deeply with the readings and I always looked forward to the conversations we would have in section about the material. My TF, Ashton, was super incredible as well – he was really the ideal TF: kind, understanding, honest, and excited to teach.But – and this is a BIG but – Naomi Oreskes is an exceptionally poor professor. She is very likely the worst instructor I have ever had, not just at Harvard, but in my life. Naomi is opinionated and self–centered. She brings a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ background to her teaching (with an emphasis on ‘master of none’), which is fine, but she is so head–strong in her beliefs that she ends up teaching her students things that are just patently false or internally inconsistent with other things she has said. The lectures present a one–sided interpretation of the causes and solutions for climate change, and sorely lack critical discussion of different perspectives or fact–based analysis.Let me first give a disclaimer. Naomi seems like a good person. She seems friendly and like someone who would be easy to get along with in other aspects of life. But when it comes to discussing the climate crisis and how to solve it, Naomi is one of the most ignorant people I have ever met. And the fact that she force feeds her own beliefs to her students – when these beliefs are based off of incorrect information or internally inconsistent assumptions – is unacceptable.Here’s one example of Naomi simply not understanding the content she tries to teach. We had several lectures about the shortcomings of nuclear power – mainly that nuclear power plants take a long time to build and that nuclear fusion still isn’t commercially viable. That’s all great. But at one point, when criticizing small modular nuclear reactors, Naomi argued that small modular reactors will never be as cost–effective as larger nuclear plants since building smaller reactors means they won’t be able to benefit from economies of scale. This statement reflects a fundamental misconception of economic theory: economies of scale have nothing to do with the size of the product itself. In fact, the entire purpose of building small *modular* nuclear reactors is that they are modular, and therefore can be mass produced in factories and then transported to sites for installation, rather than having to be custom built each time. Small modular reactors are designed exactly so that they can benefit from economies of scale, in contrast to traditional nuclear power plants. It’s remarkable that at a school like Harvard, home to some of the top economists in the world, there are still professors like Naomi who do not understand Econ 101. And this is just one example of Naomi teaching things that are just objectively incorrect.Naomi is also constantly contradicting her own beliefs. Throughout the entire course, she presents internally inconsistent beliefs about the importance of technology and scientific research. On one hand, she stresses that the US federal government has historically played a major role in many technological inventions, and should be seen as an equally valuable source of innovation as the private sector. On the other hand, she is highly skeptical of government investment in clean energy technology R&D today and derided the French government for investing in nuclear power. I left the course confused about what Naomi really thinks about technological solutions for climate change, and honestly am not sure if she has a coherent opinon on technology. Naomi tends to cherry pick success stories and failures to teach to the class, and it ends up painting a patchwork picture of climate solutions that doesn’t yield any coherent conclusion. It feels like she just latches on to certain narratives she hears in the media, and doesn’t really critically evaluate her own beliefs and consider if they are internally consistent or not.There was another lecture where she spent half the time convincing us that going to Mars was not a viable solution for addressing climate change. We know, Naomi, we know. You didn’t have to spend 45 minutes monologuing about the difficulty of timing a launch so that Earth and Mars are closest together or about the governance challenges of establishing an extraterrestrial colony. This is yet another example of Naomi not really having anything meaningful to teach, and just offering a semi–coherent rehashing of her shower thoughts with questionable relevance to the course.Naomi is also quite self–centered. We would barely go a single lecture without her name–dropping one of her celebrity friends, or her bringing up that she was invited to give a talk at XYZ conference, or that some news station interviewed her, or that her book has been made into a film, blah blah blah blah blah. It honestly just felt professionally inappropriate.You might be wondering about Naomi’s qualifications. She has a PhD in geology, and is now a professor of history of science. Why did she make the switch? She told us in lecture that history of science was a less competitive field than geology. I’m not sure what part of her academic background makes her qualified to discuss the engineering or economic challenges of climate change. And I would have thought that any professor who is teaching content outside of their field of expertise would have at least taken the time to create lectures that are factually correct and logically consistent with each other, but that did not seem to be the case with this course.So Naomi, if you’re reading this, I ask you to please reconsider the way you teach this class. You are obviously capable of running a good class, since you are a tenured professor and have been teaching for decades, but I fear this course is over–ambitious in its content and the lectures are often not grounded in facts or logic. I hope that you can be just a little more moderated when you are presenting your own beliefs and that you really fact check everything you’re saying before you teach it to dozens of undergrads. If you really want to inspire the next generation of climate leaders, you need to re–evaluate the way material is presented in lecture. I hope that you can encourage your students to think critically about the complex causes and solutions of climate change, rather than force feed them your personal beliefs that can be premised on factually incorrect statements or internally inconsistent assumptions. You have a year until you teach this course again. I hope you can make use of it.",
      "This course is quite a lot of work; the readings are heavy and sometimes quite dense. But it is incredibly helpful in building a really interdisciplinary understanding of the climate crisis, its causes, and why it's so difficult for us to address it. You will definitely learn some really important concepts and gain new ideas and frameworks of thinking about this crisis, but you will probably also get what you put into it.",

      "Take this class if you want a light course to fulfill your STS (Science) gened requirement. It's not exactly a gem, but there is very little work outside of lecture and section beyond the readings (can't imagine you'd spend more than 2–3 hours in any given week beyond exam preparation and the final paper).Lecture is sometimes interesting, but can often be quite dry and feel as though they are just repeating old information. Thankfully lectures for this class are only 50–60 minutes long rather than 75 (class started at 10:30 and we were almost always out by 11:30); sections were also closer to 45 minutes. So realistically you're spending under 3 hours a week in class. However, the attendance policy is quite ambiguous (perhaps this is required by the GENED guidelines); for lectures attendance is not recorded, although there are exit tickets that you must turn in occasionally, but it is not clear if these contribute to your attendance grade or not. I think the attendance grade (which makes up 20% of your final grade) is entirely determined by section attendance and participation, so make sure to go each week and speak to earn full credit. Also, you may get bonus points for attending lecture the week of Thanksgiving, which could swing your grade since they are strict about the 93% cutoff for an A.In terms of grading, it's not entirely trivial to get an A in this class, mostly because exams (midterm and final) are graded somewhat harshly (expect to get points docked inevitably). The exams are all essay–based without clear answers to the questions, so very subjective grading–wise (you get like a quote or a picture and you have to discuss how it relates to the course content). Also, the exams are (annoyingly) pencil paper for long written responses, though they are quite short (midterm is scheduled during lecture time and can be completed in an hour, final is scheduled during finals period but is paced to take only 2 hours). I got a 91 on the midterm and an 87 on the final and I'd consider myself to be an above average student, so be careful on the exams and make sure you know the key course concepts (go through the slides or watch the review sessions) to make sure you don't do too poorly.The paper for the class is split into three segments. The first part is just a short description of what your paper will be about (you can write about basically anything psychotherapy–related). The second part is the first three pages or so of your paper. These first two parts are basically completion and worth 10% of your total grade together. The final step is your 10 page paper, which is due toward the end of reading period. Make sure that you don't save it until the last minute if you have other finals to study for; you can probably knock it out in under 5 hours total if you're diligent, and it's really not too big of a deal. I'm pretty sure they grade quite leniently on it as well, so just make sure that you meet the requirements and do well on the exams to keep your grade up.In terms of course content, I'd say that there are some interesting ideas, but that the class as a whole is VERY broad. We talk about many topics at a mostly surface level, rarely exceeding the level of complexity you'd find in a class such as AP Psych or PSY1. In fact, most of the class is just identifying the differences between two modalities of therapy: CBT and Psychoanalysis/PPT.  So it does get quite repetitive, and I wouldn't expect to take away too much from this course if you don't find yourself continuing into a psychology or sociology concentration. The last few weeks of the course do discuss some interesting topics such as conversion therapy, AI therapy (including ChatGPT), and online therapy such as BetterHelp and its controversies. The final exam will probably have you write a longer essay discussing some of these topics in psychotherapy.Overall, if you're not too interested in any of the other STS geneds, this class is definitely a chill way to fulfill the requirement. Just don't sleep on the exams!",
      "Do not take this class. Your entire experience of the course is ruined if you are unluckily placed with an unfavorable section leader.",

We watch really interesting videos in lecture. The class overall is pretty easy. JUST GO TO LECTURE PEOPLE. Its an interesting lecture and thats really much all you need to succeed in the class.

      "Fantastic course overall; you get what you put in. If you are interested in the topic, TAKE IT! It is extremely well organized, and expectations for assignments and grading are very clear. Dr. Craycraft is a fantastic professor and person: her office hours were genuinely enlightening and I just wish I took advantage of them more. She knows so much about folklore and a variety of associated fields and when I asked her for resources or wanted to talk about basically any topic, she was super friendly and always had lots of knowledge and insight to share. Auds is the BEST TF ever: take her section if you can!! She is such a cool person and struck an amazing balance between being chill and grounding and understanding while also making me really engage in critical interesting conversations about the material. She made me excited about a 4:30pm section which is hard to do. While not overall graded super harshly, the class definitely does require WORK: more than most GenEds, and unfortunately a lot of it was busyworkish in the form of needing to write 3 150–200 word reading response comments per class which usually took me multiple hours. People definitely ended up cutting corners and not really engaging in the optional readings because we had so much writing to do: I actually don't hate the homework, but it would be good if it was 1–2 comments instead of 3 and that would give more time to engage with the other readings. All of the material on the syllabus is really interesting and organized well: I honestly recommend just checking out the syllabus if you're interested. Like at the midpoint of the course, some lectures got a bit repetitive but it got more interesting at the end: not a lot of \"answers\" to anything but provides a fascinating framework to see the world through.",
      "I would definitely not recommend taking this class if you're just looking to fulfill the GENED req. If you're interested in folk studies, good on you, but if you don't previously have that interest, this course is hard to get into.  The definitions of terms in the discipline are incongruent to how they're used in real life (ie. \"text,\" \"texture,\" and \"context\" all mean something very, very different from the Merriam–Webster definition), and that makes the course hard to understand and hyper liberal artsy–academia–y. Again, if you're into that kinda thing tho, be my guest. That being said, the assignments were very unclear in instruction, very frequent, and grading is harsh in recent gened fashion. I cannot emphasize enough how unclear the instructions were for the class' assignments. Differed in substance from where they were posted (canvas, PDF version, class verbal instruction) and generally confusing. B level grades are likely amongst non–folk/myth concentrators (according to my informal observation and conversations amongst peers). TLDR; for non–concentrators i 10/10 do not recommend.",
      "The class in comparison to other GENEDs is low workload and an enjoyable class to take with a heavy course load. I would consider it a gem as long as you do the assignments and keep up with the perusall you should be fine."

      "I'm not sure if Michael Sandel is going to offer this class again, but if he does, do not miss the opportunity to take it. This course was phenomenal. It was really inspiring and probably my favorite class this semester. I really liked the way we moved from philosopher to philosopher, and I felt like I left with a really great foundational understanding of moral/political philosophy. The guests that Professor Sandel brought in were really amazing as well. I felt like this course was likely the best space for intellectual vitality on our campus, as people respectfully disagreed with one another both in lecture and section. I loved the structure of lectures and how Professor Sandel structured lectures around audience participation and discussions, it really made it feel much smaller than the 800+ people that were in the course. I thought the papers were pretty good as well although it was definitely a tougher Gened because paper grading was a bit tough. The final exam, though, was really fair and your final grade is 40% participation so it balances out the harder papers. I felt like this course gave me a lot more clarity on my own beliefs and how to engage in conversation with others, so if that is something you are looking for definitely take it. It is definitely one of the best geneds offered, and it does not feel like a waste of your time at all.",
      "This class is overrated — I had very high expectations going into the course that it would change my thinking or life, and I would be awakened by the spirit of philosophy but this was not the case. I realized how infuriating and drab philosophy can be, and how it doesn’t really provide an answer to questions. It only left me more convinced that my own viewpoints were right — it’s hard to impose a philosophy on other people and say whether they are right or wrong. Sandel’s lectures drag on after an hour and they started to get repetitive near the end of the course. The class experience is very dependent on the TF you receive. I did not like how the course imposed an artificial curve on grading people’s papers in the class (I think no one really got higher than a 93 on the first people no matter how good it was written). Also it didn’t make sense how in philosophy papers, one is just supposed to yap and discouraged from citing sources. Take another better GenEd",
      "Good introduction to philosophy but don’t expect a gem – also TFs can vary in grading and helpfulness."

I would say that it is not too hard but you do have to work and make sure that you are relatively  (better just to be all the way) on top of all your readings and I would suggest keeping up with key terms as the semester goes on so it is easier to study for finals and midterms and to write papers.

I would not recommend taking it your freshman fall unless you feel ready to write college–level papers without taking expos and are reading to participate in extremely discussion–based sections on 4–6 difficult readings each week.

The lectures were truly the redeeming quality of this course, but the other components of the course brought it down. Having two essays and two written exams is a lot, especially depending on what section leader you have, and it was extremely difficult. There was no standardized grading across sections; some section leaders were easier, and some were much more difficult. There was not much essay help; only the main section leader could read essays, and her office hours were extremely limited. The exams were all open–ended, including one or two in–class essays and short answers. There was not much guidance on what to study for exams either. There was so much content, which made exams overwhelming. I also really did not like being graded on my participation in section, it felt like all of the discussions were forced, as you're graded on a scale depending on how many times you raise your hand or refer to the readings. There was not much room for not understanding readings. Overall, I loved the lectures and the content of the course but really disliked the other components of it.",

Structure/load wise, the class's discussion flows well and the assignments are not at all bad, they are very clearly described and it's only a total of three papers and a presentation for the semester. I really really enjoyed being in this class and I highly recommend it if you need any sort of Gov class.",

Plus, I loved the final essay prompt! Furthermore, as a white student, I will admit that I was somewhat nervous to take this highly discussion–based course, especially since I am not a student who usually engages with topics of race in my classes. But the discussion culture in this class was really positive! Whenever there was disagreement or strong positions things were always kept respectable (Dr. Rhodes is great at managing discussions) and people often changed their opinions during the course of a lecture. Also, even though the class was technically listed as 6–8:45, Dr. Rhodes usually would let us out at 8, so if you are considering not taking this class because of how late it is, do not let that stop you! It also was not bad having a nighttime course and freeing up my schedule more during the day. There are a lot of readings in the course, but they are all pretty straightforward and Dr. Rhodes does an incredible job curating readings that are actually interesting. I have taken so many gov classes here where I feel like I learned nothing by doing the readings, but that is SO NOT THE CASE with this course.",
      "This class was useful in that it challenges conceptions of race, especially those that are dominated by the American context. It builds up a notion of race that is malleable and applicable to various social hierarchies, which allows comparison across societies and histories. Essays can be troublesome because the broad essay prompts require a lot more space than is allotted for the assignment.",

The class is very discussion based, although the standards for that are somewhat opaque. Be ready to participate and prep highly for your in–class presentations.

Had very little exposure to classical texts before this and felt like it would be a squandering of a Harvard education to not read the Western canon. Now I have found myself much more interested in the big questions of political philosophy and in the influences of classical and medieval thinkers on Western political thought that, for better or worse, dominates much of the modern world. Eric Nelson is an absolutely brilliant lecturer who helps to elucidate key points of each text we read (even if you had trouble understanding/didn't read), and his lecture is like an artistic performance in and of itself. This is evidenced by the not–insignificant number of not–enrolled students who came just to listen. The TF Elias is graduating but is an absolutely wonderful lecturer as well. The readings are manageable but Eric will also review them in lecture if they are too daunting. One final note – this is probably the most conservatives I have ever had in a course (as somewhat expected for a historically–themed course), and as someone with left–wing views I found it refreshing to see more diverse political perspectives in my classes, especially in political–adjacent courses like this one.

      "TAKE THIS COURSE! This is probably my favorite Gov class so far. It is so relevant to modern–day politics and international affairs between the US and China (mainly the second half of the semester, but Prof Wang starts off every lecture with 15 minutes about current events in China and tries to tie it directly to what we are currently learning at that moment), yet interestingly draws upon China's historical context (the first half of the semester is history, then the second half is more of the logistical structure of China's government and current political issues in China). Most importantly, Prof Wang is one of the most knowledgeable, interesting, and passionate instructors I have ever had. It is definitely clear that he truly cares more about encouraging students to engage with and think about China deeply and accurately rather than forcing us to do mundane assignments and sit through boring lectures. He made every lecture extremely interesting, and always spent 15 minutes at the beginning of lecture to talk about current events, and even though that caused us to run behind schedule at some points in the semester, he was never too worried about that, because he believed those current events are equally if not more important than the content planned for the course. So even if you're not that interested in China at the moment, I guarantee you that this class will be one that you will not regret taking, solely because of Prof Wang's ability to teach in an extremely engaging way and to alleviate the stresses of grades while retaining your academic interest and intellectual rigor. Also, the syllabus might say \"pop quizzes,\" but he tells you exactly when they'll be. The structure of assignments is 1 midterm (1 hour, 1 super short essay, 2 IDs from a list he gives in advance), 2 quizzes (each of them is just 2 IDs from a list he gives in advance), and 1 final paper (12 pages in which you can write about literally anything you want about China).",

      "I spent 57 hours in total across 15 weeks, so that gives 3.8 hours per week. But please note the breakdown: In hours of each week4, 6, 4, 4, 7, 6, 6, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5Note that the hours are pretty high at around 6 hours per week leading up to the election.I took this as an elective (not a gov major here).However, you decide how much work you put in.The bulk of your grade is determined by the weekly blog posts.You can look up our current blog posts at https://www.matthewdardet.com/harvard–election–analytics–2024/Well, since you decide how much work you put in, I guess you could spend less time than I did.Participation is graded, though I wouldn’t worry too much on the grading. I belive most people will get an A, but that’s because 1347 is a class where most people in the class want to be there, and our TF (Matthew Dardet, God bless him) is a great grader.The class is literally a well–made, stress–free class where you get to be kept accountable to learn to predict the election and actually do it. The blog post assignments are the soul of this course, and prof is really adamant on Bloom’s taxonomy of education, and blog posts is his way of making us learn the most by creating. I do agree. Blog posts really let me have a lot of fun with the assignments, since I have the autonomy to choose what I write or code about, and they gave you a lot of freedom AND data to work on it.Can I just repeat how good our TF Matthew Dardet is? He put a lot of effort into the sections and he delivers them well. If I recall correctly, he’s G2 (year 2 of a 6–7 year PhD), so he will likely be around in the next election if the great American institutions of democracy hold up. I am not sure if he will be TFing for the next election, or the midterms, but he will be a great TF when he does. (I also think he is doing something like a gov seminar on public opinion for 2025 spring, might be worth checking it out).Of course, the prof is great too. Every week, you show up to lecture and watch him perform by delivering some bits of information that will build your understanding of election prediction (it doesn’t seem much each week, but it builds up and at the end of the semester you will be shocked when you talk to normal people how naive they are (and you were) in forecasting elections). Most weeks, the prof will also invite a guest to speak over zoom. They can be quite interesting, and they are literally the giants in the field. For example, we got G. Elliot Morris who leads 538 and this NBC host who is known for hosting election nights.I do agree with some Q guide comments that sometimes it can be a pain to sit through a 2 hour lecture which is not content intensive, but it’s really not too bad. Just have good spirits and follow the lecture. It’s not that uninteresting.Prof is also great in that he’s realistic about readings. He assigns them, but he also doesn’t expect us to read them, and covers their main points in lecture. That’s awesome! That means we can just read those that we find interesting, and save a copy of this book list if any of us wants to run elections in the future.I see this class as teaching you the nuances and domain expertise of election forecasting, and less of teaching you the statistical acumen or advanced machine learning techniques to do so. But the nuances are WHY this class is great! Many people can do stats or ML better than most people in this class, but the people coming from this class knows the nuances to get the juice out of any ML model applied. (I remember one guest said this, and he also added a wisdom that you should keep your writing muscles strong too. Most detrophizes.) You will also know what works and doesn’t from a mountain of previous election forecasters, while clueless ML people will try every variable and reinvent the wheel. However, if you do want to learn the stats, Matthew the goat TF does teach pretty cool stats and ML techniques in section, like Bayesian stuff and NLP stuff, but only very few of us took it from there and use it. I think a lot of the actual stat and ML should be learnt in a proper CS class, and he’s also right to say that we need proper mathematical training to make sense of the statistics. (so take the math classes!). But I must also say that simpler models are very powerful in election analytics, and more often than not outperform complex models (OLS is very versatile).I think the only “drawback” I have on this class is that I spent too much time on this course than I should have in regards to the other classes in my concentration. It’s a genuine drawback though, so think carefully if you want to spend much of your semester having a lot of fun predicting the election, but if so, don’t be like me and almost neglect your other classes too much.If you do take this class, just be mindful of bias. Most of us got the predictions wrong by being biased for the Democrats. Even our legendary TF and the prof found a way to convince themselves that the election will go one way instead of the other. And 3 out of the 4 best forecasters in the class are international students. So I think if you end up predicting it right and it wasn’t an outcome that you would’ve like, you would have done a great job as a forecastor.But mainly, have fun and learn!",

      "The content is somewhat interesting but not life–changing in anyway. Professor Sweeney is very passionate about the topic so it does make each class very engaging.  As the course goes on there seems to be a lot of busy work given to us, especially with the in–class activities so it often feels like a high school class. For example, I remember crafting a harmonizer statement at least 3 times in class to the point where it felt annoying, repetitive, and pointless. But I will say the mock Senate hearing and one of the students presenting their startUp technology were very interesting and I heard the grad school version of the class facilitates better discussions. So TLDR: while the course load may have some busy work here and there it is manageable and Prof Sweeney is such a sweetheart and is a literal genius in the tech world so it'll make for some interesting convos.",

Professor Porter is a joy to learn from and the teaching team (namely David) were great. That said, the lectures in this course are not useful as far as course content is concerned – most of what is needed for papers and exams comes through the readings. Professor Porter is filled with great stories and anecdotes, but the tradeoff is that only a small portion of lecture is actually dedicated to covering the topic at hand. Additionally, assignment deadlines sneak up fast and were quite close together in the case of the second paper and the final. Overall, I am very glad I took this course and it's great to see how passionate Professor Porter still is teaching it even after 30+ years.",

Your grade is almost entirely decided by four written assignments from the semester, and the restrictive page limit on each makes it difficult to pack the content needed in each paper.

      "I have many thoughts about this class and wish I had known certain things before taking it. I decided to take this class because, as someone who is Latinx, I was incredibly interested in the course—especially with the upcoming election (as many students in the class expressed). With that in mind, I was happy to see a Latinx professor teaching the course. Dr. Roman is an incredible professor and researcher, without a doubt. The course material includes some of the most interesting readings and papers I’ve ever had the opportunity to explore. I highly recommend the class just for the readings.However, there were some aspects of the class that I quite disliked, although I still believe the course was worth taking. First, there are two quizzes that require you to study and complete the readings. That said, the quizzes themselves are fairly easy as long as you prepare. The professor and TF provide an excellent study guide for both quizzes, and most (if not all) of the content from the study guide appears on the quizzes. Since I found the readings to be one of the best parts of the class, completing them made the quizzes manageable. Second, the reading responses were my least favorite part of the class because the grading was extremely strict. I often found the feedback frustrating, as some of the comments focused on things that were not explicitly addressed in the rubric. Even though I understood and engaged with the readings, the responses required a particular kind of analysis or assumptions that made writing them unnecessarily stressful. I strongly encourage future students to meet with the TF or professor before each reading response and visit them afterward to understand how to improve.Third, this may just be a personal critique, but at times I became frustrated with the class's heavy emphasis on the label “Latinx” which at times felt overly pessimistic or divisive.One final note: the final exam requires some basic coding in R. If you don’t have much experience with R, you should still be okay, but this could be a potential dealbreaker for some students.Beyond these critiques, I really enjoyed section. Julius was an incredible TF, and section was actually my favorite part of the course. It provided a space to have discussions about aspects of the class and readings that weren’t covered in lecture. I felt more intellectually stimulated in section than in the main lectures. Julius was amazing, and I highly recommend him as a TF.Additionally, both Julius and Dr. Roman maintained excellent professionalism and were always willing to help students. Professor Roman is a devoted educator and a great lecturer. His research is fascinating, and I highly recommend looking into it.Overall, the class was great, and I would recommend it—especially if you are interested in understanding Latinx people and their political behaviors. In the end, my grievances with the course do not outweigh its strengths. I highly recommend it.",

The two midterm exams and the ten page paper all back to back was a doozy, and I constantly felt like I had another big assignment to worry about for this course. This is definitely the most time I've spent on a government course before, including GOV 94 and GOV 97. There are so many concepts and IR theories in this course that you have to remember for the exams –– they aren't necessarily hard, but the sheer volume of them can feel overwhelming. The exams were largely a question of whether you went to lecture and could memorize the many concepts that were covered in the lectures/readings. Overall, though, I still think the content of the course was very interesting and Kertzer is a wonderful professor and lecturer. His lectures are always engaging, and he really cares about his students and the material (e.g. he knows everyone by name in his 100+ student lecture). He is incredibly knowledgeable and makes the material (although there's a lot of it) digestible. This course gave me a great IR foundation that I will take with me throughout my Gov courses and in understanding the current events that make up U.S. foreign policy today."

      "If you're considering this course, you probably find the content interesting already, and I think it's a very good overview of both Chinese foreign policy and the history of the CCP over the past century. Obviously, this is a lot of content, and there's a lot of reading assigned every week (like 100 per class). Personally I did not do all the readings in full, and I feel like it's not necessary to do all of them in order to learn. Lectures: Lectures were fine and usually pretty informative, although they do get boring sometimes. Professor Johnston is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, but I think at the same time he's also a pretty slow talker. Lectures aren't the most engaging—Professor Johnston tends to just go through his slides without really asking questions for the class to answer, and overall doesn't engage with students that much. I think he runs the grad students' section, but if you're an undergrad he will probably never directly interact with you unless you stay after class to ask him questions. Later in the semester when my other classes got busy, I definitely stopped attending lecture as frequently, which I kind of regret because I do find the more contemporary topics like trade and security under Xi Jinping very interesting. It's just hard to motivate yourself to attend.Sections: Sections were fine. They're just one hour and the TF Taegyun was pretty good at keeping us engaged, so it wasn't bad at all. However, most of it is just reviewing what's already covered in class and the readings in a more systematic way, which sometimes felt a bit repetitive. The one time we did a policy discussion simulation was really fun. I wish we had more debate–style discussions like that, even if ungraded. I feel like it would add more to the course, especially given lectures are already very fact–based and don't really include much engagement from the class. Midterm: The midterm was not bad. I started going through past readings and putting together a cheat sheet around the weekend before my midterm, and I felt pretty confident going in. I think the prompts for the midterm were all standard and expectable, nothing too surprising, although it would be nice if we were given at least one practice midterm to study with. I'm not a gov concentrator but I've taken other gov courses before. I would say grading for the midterm was okay, although for the department it was probably on the harsher side. Final: I chose to write the final paper instead of taking the final exam, and honestly that was such a good decision. My finals period was absolute hell (two STEM finals and two research papers) but writing this paper was probably a highlight. Unless you do every single reading every week, studying for the finals (which is closed–notes) might be a long and painful process of memorizing authors and arguments and events. Writing the final paper might take you a bit more time, but for me was a much more enjoyable process. I really feel like I learned a lot about doing gov research and putting together a paper, and you honestly get so much support throughout the process. Chinese foreign policy is a broad topic so there's lots to write about, and you have pretty free range in the methodology you use. If you're at all interested in doing gov research or want to explore a topic deeper, I really recommend choosing the final paper option. I don't think it was much harder than taking a final exam.Overall, I would recommend taking this course. There's not a lot of gov courses offered from a non–American perspective or with a non–Western topic focus, but this is one of them.",

This approach left students struggling to make sense of the dense code and equations on the slides. Overall there seemed to be minimal effort in designing a cohesive course. The problem sets were very long and mostly consisted of exercises copied directly from the book. Often they lacked basic explanations of the variables or datasets used, making them confusing. Moreover, most exercises had no connection to political science and we're graded inconsistently. On top of this, the sections were extremely unhelpful as the TF didn't prepare a proper class and rather used it as another version of office hours. The TF appeared to have a limited grasp of the subject matter and gave confusing answers to our questions. While the course included a final project with two memos and a presentation, neither the professor nor the TF provided meaningful feedback at any stage.

      "As the revived introductory history course, this class had so much potential, especially for the ⅓ of the class that were freshmen. This course marketed itself as “not your high school history class,” but in reality, this course could gain a lot by learning from high school history courses. My recommendations for this course primarily grapple with three issues: Size, interaction, and support.History 10 claimed that “Lectures will be interactive, modeling debate and disagreement.” However, the very phrase “lectures will be interactive” is an oxymoron. There is countless research that lectures (passive learning) are ineffective for student learning (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7383800/ ; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6765278/ ; https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1435106.pdf ; https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article–abstract/13/1/97/10281/Mass–Instruction–or–Higher–Learning–The–Impact–of?redirectedFrom=fulltext ). Here are potential remedies:I. Say no to auditorsIt must be flattering that there are dozens of auditors attending lectures, but when they make up a silent half of the class, students can easily be under the impression that no one is participating.II. Auditors increase the class size, making lecture even more “lecture–y.” Rather than “modeling debate and disagreement,” let students do the debate and disagreement.This class operated under the impression that watching the professors do things and interact was “teaching.” This, in fact, is not teaching. If all History 10 could offer was available to simply watch, then the course could simply be a YouTube series.The best learning and historical debate comes from actually interacting with the content. Simply reading assignments and writing about them in section is not active.III. Connect modules betterTry harder to connect them throughout, not just one singular “triangulation.” It would be much more impactful if we built connections throughout the modules, and especially if it was US doing the exploration, rather than simply listening to profs. lay it out.IV. Get rid of lectureBefore you immediately write this suggestion off as “too impossible/difficult,” I would like to remind the professors that this course is meant to be a gateway, transformative history course. Instead of following the lead of centuries of higher education models and the countless massive lecture courses, this course SHOULD challenge the status quo.Much of the issues with this course stem from the lecture structure. As shown in the Memory Module, active engagement with history, monuments, and museums is a far more effective form of memory—active memory. The same can be said to teaching history: If students themselves are not interacting with and piecing together history and its meanings, they do not gain anything from the history. If your goal is to “raise [students’] historical consciousness[es]” and “[teach] how to deploy historical thinking,” you have to have students actually apply them themselves. Historical thinking is inherently at odds with the lecture format—What historical questioning, curiosity, and revelation comes from listening to one person give their take on historical events? Professors also complained about lack of student engagement in the course overall, and eventually banned electronics. I support the decision to remove electronics, but this will not fix the root cause. Look at any popular lecture course at Harvard. Econ 10: Students don’t even show up. CS 50: Students watch the lecture asynchronously or not at all. Justice, which is renowned for its unconventional interactive lecture style: Students are electronicless and still multitasking/disengaged/falling asleep (https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/10/11/ruiz–michael–sandel–greatest–injustice/). The lecture format is inherently unconducive to active engagement. Perhaps this format worked better centuries ago, with longer attention spans and greater need for distributing as much information as possible in a limited amount of time. But in our PRESENT, we have unprecedented effects from technological advances. While it is perfectly valid for the professors to be dissatisfied with such disengagement, it is also illogical to be stubborn and refuse to adapt to the conditions of the present. Students aren’t doing readings anymore? Make them. If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking, students have no incentive to do the reading. If students have to utilize the material, talk/debate about it with their peers, and create their own conclusions, they’ll either have to do the readings or face embarrassment. Students aren’t engaging during lecture? If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking in a LECTURE, students have no incentive to speak up. If the course is smaller, more discussion–based, students can learn from each other and the professors.Before you argue that “section provides a chance for smaller group discussion and deeper dives into the readings,” the ratio of time for lecture to section is 2.5;1. If students were already disengaged in lecture, having a section, where students just complete writing assignments or random vaguely related activities, will be just as ineffective.Another effect of the lecture style and large class size was a complete lack of community. Learning from peer interaction is just as valuable as any other academic aspect. With the lecture style and large class size, it was near–impossible to even get to know anyone else in the class. Even in smaller sections, there was no community building or natural interactions.I. Say no to auditorsIt’s hard to turn and talk to someone when they are, in fact, not even a student.II. Get rid of lectureThe lecture is inherently ineffective for building any kind of class community. Look at the structure of Sever 113 itself. All students are facing the front, not each other. It’s difficult to speak up or share your real thoughts to a lecture hall full of strangers and silent old people.III. Three professorsThere was so much opportunity in having THREE professors co–teach a course. Yet most of the time, it was just one professor teaching while the rest sat aside. Now imagine how that would look if three professors each took one–third of the class to discuss content during class blocks?The final, and perhaps one of the most important, con of this course is the lack of support/attention for students. History 10 claims to be “a new way to start––or keep––thinking about historical events, historical change, and historical context.”I. “Thinking about historical [fill in the blank]…”Almost 100% of the course time was dedicated to listening to the professors talk about their historical research. Section was solely centered around the module themes. While interaction with the modules is expected, the sheer amount of dedication to only looking at the professors’ research means there is no room for students to grow their historical thinking.The only place where students were encouraged to conduct their own historical research and thinking was in a 3–part essay series with a capstone project (another essay + three paragraphs). Each essay had immense vague and broad prompts, and lacked sufficient guidance. Each prompt was just a paragraph of questions, and extra information on the last two essays was only added after student complaints.There was no actual guidance on HOW to conduct historical research, WHAT kind of questions to ask, or WHERE to look for connections. Of course, there is no one formula to historical research, but there must be some advice that three renowned history professors can give.Additionally, all feedback was solely from the TFs (Hagar/Kabl). While these TFs were friendly and interacted with students, the feedback left consisted of barely a paragraph, vague references, and reiterations of the prompt. There was no clear advice on how to improve.II. Professors: Dedicate more time to your students.Having THREE professors had so much potential. The supposed instructor – student ratio would be quite good, but it was not used effectively. The three professors acted as if they were on a talk show/podcast and really only talked to one another—hardly ever the actual students.Even during the coffee chat that was arranged to allow for more interaction with the professors, the three professors mainly spoke to each other, only taking questions from students.Recommendation: Become comfortable having casual conversations with students. Notice when you are prioritizing interacting with each other rather than us. III. Say no to/change the (memory) boxCool in concept, and perhaps is fine as a one–time activity during section, but if you continue it…The message about what items should be put in the box was extremely confusing: “the idea is not narrowly to include something that shows ‘what it’s like to be a Harvard student in 2024,’ or ‘what it’s like to be the specific person who you are’ (although these are fine).” Get rid of the “although these are fine.” Mixed messaging.We sat through ~ 10+ presentations of the SAME content. Could be cool to look at the items as a whole/section once, but there’s no need to repeat the same thing over and over. Instead, consider dedicating that time to student presentations on their research projects.IV. Let us cook.This class is marketed as a chance to improve our historical research and understanding, etc. The ONLY research/exploration was our one, semester–long project. But in the end, the projects essentially went nowhere. A random capstone collection, graded by TFs, just like all the other assignments. Are the professors genuinely interested in our historical interests? We’ll never know.It would be much more engaging and student–centered to highlight student research (and to clarify, putting on a slideshow with ~60 slides with one photo to encapsulate three essays worth of research while everyone talks about unrelated topics does NOT count).V. Please… please just give us more support…. Please just interact with us…….. Please just converse normally…… I beg youWe were assigned essays about a subject of our interest…But when were we taught historical research methods? Any historical processes? When were we given advice or tips on how to improve our historical methods?Counterargument: Professors modeled historical research in the modules!In actuality, the professors simply gave summaries of their discoveries and different anecdotes, nothing really about how they went about searching for this information.Of course, there is no one–method–fits–all, but hearing advice and experiences from seasoned historians is helpful regardlessAlso, modeling is not teaching. Teaching is from guidance in hands–on experience, AKA, not in a lecture.VI.Better feedback NOW!Dude. SO unclear what caused the grade we received. Legit no helpful feedback. Legit just 5 sentences and rephrasing the prompt again. There’s no way all the feedback for a 1000 word essay is a mere <50 word comment.VII. Get rid of the egoThis is a bit more subjective/based on the vibe, but these are genuine impressions I have from the class.It very much felt like the professors just wanted an audience to watch them. I understand that y’all are good friends and whatnot, but the entire class should not revolve around your dynamic. The question box, the Wednesday news recap really just felt like a talk show podcast type thing, where they weren’t interested in what we want to say, what we felt, what we wanted, etc. While they did make some changes mid–way through, which were good, the vibe was still off, and students still didn’t feel like contributing.Counterargument: Why don’t the students speak up if they want to be included?This is why community building in classes is so critical. Again, in a large lecture, with both classmates and random old people, it is actually quite difficult to build the courage to say what you truly think and break the silence.**Something to reflect on: Who are you teaching this class for? Are you here for the students or yourselves? Is this a transformative, gateway co–taught history course or a chance for three professor friends to hang out?There are plenty of counterarguments to my cases:I. Office hours exist for a reasonYes, a 1–2 hour block that exists once a week. You said it yourselves, Harvard students are now prioritizing extracurriculars beyond anything else. You can certainly complain about it, but there’s nothing you can do to change the entire culture of our campus. Adapt to it. Adding more office hours opportunities, promoting it more, etc.Or even making the class itself more interactive (lecture → seminar)II. Lectures are a pillar of higher educationThis is a fact that has not changed in decades of higher education. However, times are changing. The average attention span has become shorter and shorter. New research on better teaching pedagogy challenges lecture style. Technology is addictive, and lectures are the best suited place for getting off track (your job is literally to sit there). Again, you’ve all recognized the changing present. It’s logical to try and adapt to it.III. But changing to seminar would cap enrollmentTrue, but perhaps this can be a good thing. You get rid of auditors and many students who are really only in the class for a GEM (easy class). Perhaps you’ll have to put more effort into a seminar style course, but that also means students will have to reciprocate. Tighter–knit community, THREE freaking professors to go aroundIV. These are such demanding asksI know. But I also believe in the power and potential of history. If this class is to be the gateway, the representative course of Harvard History, shouldn’t it be a lot? Shouldn’t it challenge the status quo? Shouldn’t it be interactive? Shouldn’t it be a place of both community and intellectual growth? Shouldn’t it be full of risk–taking?You will get out of this course what you put into it. Again, who, exactly, are you teaching this class for?TL;DR: Unless you are a die–hard Jill Lepore super–fan or this class goes through SERIOUS structural changes, I very strongly do not recommend taking this course.",
      "Do not take this class. The professors are biased, the grading is horrible, and the students are super one–minded and won't change their minds about anything. I'm not even conservative but this class silenced those views completely. The professors were not nice at all (one time, Prof. Weld shouted at a student whose phone rang off by mistake, and another time Prof. Lepore called me out and embarrassed me in front of the entire class for checking a text from my family member).  The grading was so arbitrary, there was no rubric for any of our assignments, and people literally got horrible grades for no reason (on the first paper, half my class got a D).",

There was no clear advice on how to improve.II. Professors: Dedicate more time to your students.Having THREE professors had so much potential. The supposed instructor – student ratio would be quite good, but it was not used effectively. The three professors acted as if they were on a talk show/podcast and really only talked to one another—hardly ever the actual students.Even during the coffee chat that was arranged to allow for more interaction with the professors, the three professors mainly spoke to each other, only taking questions from students.Recommendation: Become comfortable having casual conversations with students. Notice when you are prioritizing interacting with each other rather than us. III. Say no to/change the (memory) boxCool in concept, and perhaps is fine as a one–time activity during section, but if you continue it…The message about what items should be put in the box was extremely confusing: “the idea is not narrowly to include something that shows ‘what it’s like to be a Harvard student in 2024,’ or ‘what it’s like to be the specific person who you are’ (although these are fine).” Get rid of the “although these are fine.” Mixed messaging.We sat through ~ 10+ presentations of the SAME content. Could be cool to look at the items as a whole/section once, but there’s no need to repeat the same thing over and over. Instead, consider dedicating that time to student presentations on their research projects.IV. Let us cook.This class is marketed as a chance to improve our historical research and understanding, etc. The ONLY research/exploration was our one, semester–long project. But in the end, the projects essentially went nowhere. A random capstone collection, graded by TFs, just like all the other assignments. Are the professors genuinely interested in our historical interests? We’ll never know.It would be much more engaging and student–centered to highlight student research (and to clarify, putting on a slideshow with ~60 slides with one photo to encapsulate three essays worth of research while everyone talks about unrelated topics does NOT count).V. Please… please just give us more support…. Please just interact with us…….. Please just converse normally…… I beg youWe were assigned essays about a subject of our interest…But when were we taught historical research methods? Any historical processes? When were we given advice or tips on how to improve our historical methods?Counterargument: Professors modeled historical research in the modules!In actuality, the professors simply gave summaries of their discoveries and different anecdotes, nothing really about how they went about searching for this information.Of course, there is no one–method–fits–all, but hearing advice and experiences from seasoned historians is helpful regardlessAlso, modeling is not teaching. Teaching is from guidance in hands–on experience, AKA, not in a lecture.VI.Better feedback NOW!Dude. SO unclear what caused the grade we received. Legit no helpful feedback. Legit just 5 sentences and rephrasing the prompt again. There’s no way all the feedback for a 1000 word essay is a mere <50 word comment.VII. Get rid of the egoThis is a bit more subjective/based on the vibe, but these are genuine impressions I have from the class.It very much felt like the professors just wanted an audience to watch them. I understand that y’all are good friends and whatnot, but the entire class should not revolve around your dynamic. The question box, the Wednesday news recap really just felt like a talk show podcast type thing, where they weren’t interested in what we want to say, what we felt, what we wanted, etc. While they did make some changes mid–way through, which were good, the vibe was still off, and students still didn’t feel like contributing.Counterargument: Why don’t the students speak up if they want to be included?This is why community building in classes is so critical. Again, in a large lecture, with both classmates and random old people, it is actually quite difficult to build the courage to say what you truly think and break the silence.**Something to reflect on: Who are you teaching this class for? Are you here for the students or yourselves? Is this a transformative, gateway co–taught history course or a chance for three professor friends to hang out?There are plenty of counterarguments to my cases:I. Office hours exist for a reasonYes, a 1–2 hour block that exists once a week. You said it yourselves, Harvard students are now prioritizing extracurriculars beyond anything else. You can certainly complain about it, but there’s nothing you can do to change the entire culture of our campus. Adapt to it. Adding more office hours opportunities, promoting it more, etc.Or even making the class itself more interactive (lecture → seminar)II. Lectures are a pillar of higher educationThis is a fact that has not changed in decades of higher education. However, times are changing. The average attention span has become shorter and shorter. New research on better teaching pedagogy challenges lecture style. Technology is addictive, and lectures are the best suited place for getting off track (your job is literally to sit there). Again, you’ve all recognized the changing present. It’s logical to try and adapt to it.III. But changing to seminar would cap enrollmentTrue, but perhaps this can be a good thing. You get rid of auditors and many students who are really only in the class for a GEM (easy class). Perhaps you’ll have to put more effort into a seminar style course, but that also means students will have to reciprocate. Tighter–knit community, THREE freaking professors to go aroundIV. These are such demanding asksI know. But I also believe in the power and potential of history. If this class is to be the gateway, the representative course of Harvard History, shouldn’t it be a lot? Shouldn’t it challenge the status quo? Shouldn’t it be interactive? Shouldn’t it be a place of both community and intellectual growth? Shouldn’t it be full of risk–taking?You will get out of this course what you put into it. Again, who, exactly, are you teaching this class for?TL;DR: Unless you are a die–hard Jill Lepore super–fan or this class goes through SERIOUS structural changes, I very strongly do not recommend taking this course.",
      "Do not take this class. The professors are biased, the grading is horrible, and the students are super one–minded and won't change their minds about anything. I'm not even conservative but this class silenced those views completely. The professors were not nice at all (one time, Prof. Weld shouted at a student whose phone rang off by mistake, and another time Prof. Lepore called me out and embarrassed me in front of the entire class for checking a text from my family member).  The grading was so arbitrary, there was no rubric for any of our assignments, and people literally got horrible grades for no reason (on the first paper, half my class got a D).",

      "As the revived introductory history course, this class had so much potential, especially for the ⅓ of the class that were freshmen. This course marketed itself as “not your high school history class,” but in reality, this course could gain a lot by learning from high school history courses. My recommendations for this course primarily grapple with three issues: Size, interaction, and support.History 10 claimed that “Lectures will be interactive, modeling debate and disagreement.” However, the very phrase “lectures will be interactive” is an oxymoron. There is countless research that lectures (passive learning) are ineffective for student learning (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7383800/ ; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6765278/ ; https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1435106.pdf ; https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article–abstract/13/1/97/10281/Mass–Instruction–or–Higher–Learning–The–Impact–of?redirectedFrom=fulltext ). Here are potential remedies:I. Say no to auditorsIt must be flattering that there are dozens of auditors attending lectures, but when they make up a silent half of the class, students can easily be under the impression that no one is participating.II. Auditors increase the class size, making lecture even more “lecture–y.” Rather than “modeling debate and disagreement,” let students do the debate and disagreement.This class operated under the impression that watching the professors do things and interact was “teaching.” This, in fact, is not teaching. If all History 10 could offer was available to simply watch, then the course could simply be a YouTube series.The best learning and historical debate comes from actually interacting with the content. Simply reading assignments and writing about them in section is not active.III. Connect modules betterTry harder to connect them throughout, not just one singular “triangulation.” It would be much more impactful if we built connections throughout the modules, and especially if it was US doing the exploration, rather than simply listening to profs. lay it out.IV. Get rid of lectureBefore you immediately write this suggestion off as “too impossible/difficult,” I would like to remind the professors that this course is meant to be a gateway, transformative history course. Instead of following the lead of centuries of higher education models and the countless massive lecture courses, this course SHOULD challenge the status quo.Much of the issues with this course stem from the lecture structure. As shown in the Memory Module, active engagement with history, monuments, and museums is a far more effective form of memory—active memory. The same can be said to teaching history: If students themselves are not interacting with and piecing together history and its meanings, they do not gain anything from the history. If your goal is to “raise [students’] historical consciousness[es]” and “[teach] how to deploy historical thinking,” you have to have students actually apply them themselves. Historical thinking is inherently at odds with the lecture format—What historical questioning, curiosity, and revelation comes from listening to one person give their take on historical events? Professors also complained about lack of student engagement in the course overall, and eventually banned electronics. I support the decision to remove electronics, but this will not fix the root cause. Look at any popular lecture course at Harvard. Econ 10: Students don’t even show up. CS 50: Students watch the lecture asynchronously or not at all. Justice, which is renowned for its unconventional interactive lecture style: Students are electronicless and still multitasking/disengaged/falling asleep (https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/10/11/ruiz–michael–sandel–greatest–injustice/). The lecture format is inherently unconducive to active engagement. Perhaps this format worked better centuries ago, with longer attention spans and greater need for distributing as much information as possible in a limited amount of time. But in our PRESENT, we have unprecedented effects from technological advances. While it is perfectly valid for the professors to be dissatisfied with such disengagement, it is also illogical to be stubborn and refuse to adapt to the conditions of the present. Students aren’t doing readings anymore? Make them. If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking, students have no incentive to do the reading. If students have to utilize the material, talk/debate about it with their peers, and create their own conclusions, they’ll either have to do the readings or face embarrassment. Students aren’t engaging during lecture? If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking in a LECTURE, students have no incentive to speak up. If the course is smaller, more discussion–based, students can learn from each other and the professors.Before you argue that “section provides a chance for smaller group discussion and deeper dives into the readings,” the ratio of time for lecture to section is 2.5;1. If students were already disengaged in lecture, having a section, where students just complete writing assignments or random vaguely related activities, will be just as ineffective.Another effect of the lecture style and large class size was a complete lack of community. Learning from peer interaction is just as valuable as any other academic aspect. With the lecture style and large class size, it was near–impossible to even get to know anyone else in the class. Even in smaller sections, there was no community building or natural interactions.I. Say no to auditorsIt’s hard to turn and talk to someone when they are, in fact, not even a student.II. Get rid of lectureThe lecture is inherently ineffective for building any kind of class community. Look at the structure of Sever 113 itself. All students are facing the front, not each other. It’s difficult to speak up or share your real thoughts to a lecture hall full of strangers and silent old people.III. Three professorsThere was so much opportunity in having THREE professors co–teach a course. Yet most of the time, it was just one professor teaching while the rest sat aside. Now imagine how that would look if three professors each took one–third of the class to discuss content during class blocks?The final, and perhaps one of the most important, con of this course is the lack of support/attention for students. History 10 claims to be “a new way to start––or keep––thinking about historical events, historical change, and historical context.”I. “Thinking about historical [fill in the blank]…”Almost 100% of the course time was dedicated to listening to the professors talk about their historical research. Section was solely centered around the module themes. While interaction with the modules is expected, the sheer amount of dedication to only looking at the professors’ research means there is no room for students to grow their historical thinking.The only place where students were encouraged to conduct their own historical research and thinking was in a 3–part essay series with a capstone project (another essay + three paragraphs). Each essay had immense vague and broad prompts, and lacked sufficient guidance. Each prompt was just a paragraph of questions, and extra information on the last two essays was only added after student complaints.There was no actual guidance on HOW to conduct historical research, WHAT kind of questions to ask, or WHERE to look for connections. Of course, there is no one formula to historical research, but there must be some advice that three renowned history professors can give.Additionally, all feedback was solely from the TFs (Hagar/Kabl). While these TFs were friendly and interacted with students, the feedback left consisted of barely a paragraph, vague references, and reiterations of the prompt. There was no clear advice on how to improve.II. Professors: Dedicate more time to your students.Having THREE professors had so much potential. The supposed instructor – student ratio would be quite good, but it was not used effectively. The three professors acted as if they were on a talk show/podcast and really only talked to one another—hardly ever the actual students.Even during the coffee chat that was arranged to allow for more interaction with the professors, the three professors mainly spoke to each other, only taking questions from students.Recommendation: Become comfortable having casual conversations with students.

      "I LOVED THIS COURSE!! I feel like as a subject itself the Yalta conference is not that interesting, and there were definitely times every week doing the reading where it felt repetitive. I think the actual two hour discussion is really what made is super fun. Professor Plokhii is obviously at the top of his field, and I felt like always had very insightful things to add. He was also really good at directing the discussion and asking students the right questions to make the conversation more lively. I genuinely learned in this course. I would say if you're interesting in Cold War history, diplomatic history, international history, or any sort of history studying old men passive aggressively jabbing at each other in a conference, take this course. As a sophomore, I also really enjoyed writing the paper. I would say if you haven't taken HIST 97 yet (which I haven't), writing the paper will be a learning curve. For me, this was my first 20–page, original history paper that I wrote at Harvard. And they really expect your paper to be original and contribute something novel. I personally really liked the research and writing process. It might feel frustrating at the very beginning, because you're pretty much allowed to write about anything at all related to early Cold War/late WWII history but that topic is so broad and also so well–studied that it may be hard to find a topic you're both interested in and have something to say about. But really stick to the process, dig hard through archives, and I promise you'll find something cool to talk about. Really lean on Professor Plokhii and Gulchehra as resources—they are both so sweet, respond to emails basically within a day, and are always down to meet with you for long discussions where you freak out about not knowing what to write about. Really really could not have put this paper together without them. My only mistake was taking this alongside other difficult courses, which made my semester quite painful, but if you have the time to dedicate to it this is an AMAZING history seminar to take. One thing to keep in mind—I feel like expectations for various assignments are not always the clearest. They usually don't get put on Canvas, and instead may be sent to you through an email or just stated verbally by Professor Plokhii in class. But always reach out if something's unclear—the teaching staff is really responsive and clear once you ask them.",
      "Take this if you're ready to learn a lot about a little, but then be surprised about how much you've learned. You start with Yalta, but you learn about WWII and the Cold War all in one place.",

The weekly briefs do play kind of a deciding factor in whether or not you'll get an A, as do the midterm, so stay on top of those. Logevall is also famously a great lecturer. My reservation with this class is that if you're looking for more Vietnamese perspectives you simply won't get it. It's very US centric which course staff acknowledges but doesn't see a problem with. Overall, if you work hard you'll do fine!",

Professor Logevall is amazing and challenges you to think deeply about historical questions, the value of history and how the war shaped the America (and world) we live in today.  It is a challenging class in the sense that there is a lot of reading, but I have never enjoyed reading as much as I did in this class. It felt meaningful, purposeful and really made me challenge what I thought I knew about the war.  I felt moved by the class and I realized how understanding this period of history really enhanced my understanding of the America we live in today.",

This is an extremely useful class for not just policymakers but even those who want to work in the private sector.

The readings are reasonable for a seminar and feed quite nicely into each other; the weekly timeline posts (ie. discussion posts) are great prep for class and graded on completion; the assignments are spaced out nicely and are useful for the final project; and the feedback on assignments is fantastic and timely. I think all of the students in the class are either from Latin America or study Latin America, but I did not have that background and didn't feel I was particularly disadvantaged. I would also add the grad students were SUPER interesting and lovely and would add components of their research to the class which enriched our conversations. Would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking for a reasonable class looking to dive deeply into the histories of Latin American countries (namely: Cuba, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina).",

This is one of the only classes that actively seeks to integrate and understand available technology rather than shunning or regulating it, and I feel that that is a much more productive way to understand the age we live in. The final project of a digital gallery is also extremely thoughtful as it forces us to think about how to keep research relevant in a digital age –– surely data cannot just all be expressed in written papers. Professor Pizzorno is also a really supportive professor who makes the class what it is, giving us a chance to experiment and fail, and is genuinely committed to our learning.

It opens your mind to so many new ways of thinking and helps to inform the way that you consume pop culture. As pop culture is something that is pretty inescapable, it is so interesting to look at it from a historical lens and see the ways it has changed over the last century. Each week I was excited to read the course materials and engage with my classmates in discussion. Angela is amazing and is great at fostering a welcoming environment where you can become friends with your classmates, learn, ask questions, and improve as a writer and student.

      "This course was very well run and I greatly enjoyed it. Dr. Riegel is a great teacher and I highly recommend taking any course that they teach. This course was great for a variety of reasons. The first was that the materials were interesting and well put together. The organization of the syllabus week by week also made it so the class was always talking about something new and it was well organized to lead from one theme to the next. The papers were also varied in the skills they targeted which made them more interesting to write (a primary source analysis, a film review, a research paper). I was grateful for the flexibility provided in what we could write about for each paper and the ability to guide discussions in class to those readings and topics we found most interesting. Dr. Riegel makes a 2 hour seminar feel like it goes by so fast because of all of the great discussions they lead. They are really good at guiding the discussion and answering questions, as well as including multimedia sources to keep the class interested. I am not someone who is very talkative in sections usually but found myself encouraged to share my ideas and that made this class even better. Overall, a great experience and I would take this course or any other taught by Dr. Riegel no matter your concentration.",

It was so special to hear everyone's genius perspectives. In addition, EVERYONE BUYS IN, does the readings, and becomes equally obsessed with staring at the moon in their free time. This makes the class so much more inretersting than the conventional giant Harvard lectures where everyone is checking their emails. Professor Roberts is so so smart and makes the most mindblowing connections to everyone's points. Any time you google something related to class topics, her name is one of the first to pop up. And she makes herself so accessible in office hours for any questions or discussions you may have. Honestly, this class changed my life. My whole camera roll is filled with photos of the moon.

But anyways, I really liked it, because it's pretty much a whole semester just to write one paper, and you meet for class once a week just to check in on how you're doing and get some tips on how to do your paper better. I really liked the freedom and flexibility of this style of course. Also, Simon was such a good instructor and always gave such helpful and more importantly, specifically ACTIONABLE feedback on papers so that you'd know exactly what you have to do to get an A. Also, bc the whole semester is just writing a paper (you don't rly start till after the 5th or 6th week of the course, bc the first part of the course is kinda a super short repeat of HS 97), you should start as early as possible in writing and get as much done as you can earlier on in the process (e.g., the writing chunks often have a page minimum of 4–5 pages, but if you happen to have more time that week, you should do way more), bc then there will be more instances where your instructor can give you more specific feedback so that you can guarantee an A. And also, if you do it early enough, it is definitely possible to be basically done the paper by the end of thanksgiving break (if you're taking it in the fall).",

The readings were sometimes long and dense, but it was clear that they were carefully chosen to provoke intellectual engagement and challenge our preconceived beliefs. The readings complemented each other very well, and I was consistently impressed by how the discussions from one week would connect to or resolve lingering questions from the previous week.Professor Kochhar did an excellent job facilitating class discussions, designing exercises to help us engage deeply with the material, and adapting to the needs and curiosities of the class. His openness and flexibility were key to making this class one of the most memorable of my entire college career.If you're interested in topics like medicine, public health, psychology, systems of healing, or similar fields, I highly recommend this course.

This was the class that made me reflect on that and realize that this is the first class I have taken at Harvard that made it feel like a HARVARD class, where the professors are both soo knowledgeable, the readings are so insightful, your classmates are very good at articulating their words. I learned so much in this class and the feedbacks on papers, especially the second paper. The professors are both the kindest people you will meet and always open to meeting in office hours. They know how to raise discussion questions, how to direct you toward innovation, and how to guide you. They are both amazing. The papers were fun to write.

Prof. Jasanoff, it should go without saying, is knowledgeable about such a great breadth and depth of things that the class is honestly worth it just to have two hours of time each week set aside to witness a great orator orate. However, there is the massive caveat that this class is offered via HKS, so most of the class population comes from their various mid–career masters programs, which are such mixed bags. I'm a student at the college, so the experience was definitely different from any FAS course, especially because the weekly meetings took the form of a pseudo–seminar discussion that could never really get off the ground because the class was so large and was almost always distracted away from the assigned readings into talking about specific examples that few people could meaningfully comment on. All that said, SPP and Prof. Jasanoff are iconic for a reason, and its great strength is that there is something for everyone. Mixing HKS/GSAS/undergrad students together is always a challenge and I think SPP meets it to the extent that it can, although I would still say the size of the class was the main inhibitor to productive discussion. Take it, do the readings, go to Prof. Jasanoff's OH, learn from your classmates of all intellectual/professional stripes, write the paper––but just understand that the bulk of your learning will occur outside of the classroom.",

      "Take this class!! As a humanities major, having this science class in the mix with my English and writing classes was a great way to give my brain a break from writing and reading and analyzing. I found the workload super manageable but didn't feel like an easy pass – grading is not harsh but learning from feedback feels super necessary to advance. Readings are really interesting – if you have the time, DO ALL THE READINGS!! They make a world of difference when you're listening to lecture, but also for material understanding overall. The readings Desmond picks are always super interesting and if you're interested in a specific topic, make sure to focus on the readings. The lectures are great but sometimes found myself drifting off. If you miss a lecture, you're not completely cooked but I would recommend going to all the lectures! It's new material every week and can be hard to catch up if you miss something, especially if you miss two in a row. The lecture slides are great to refer to, but Desmond says a lot of stuff that doesn't make it onto the slides in lecture. Assignments are great and can be procrastinated if you're a procrastinator. Super doable in the night they're due, but actually really helpful. I felt like the writing I did every week helped me to study for the final! And my writing improved so so much from TF feedback. She's super empathetic and doesn't punish you for the learning curve in academic writing in the beginning of the class. I felt like I was seeing my work improve with her help.",

      "This is an amazing class, and you should definitely take it if you have any interest in how we have evolved to have friendships, or if you want to think more deeply and intentionally about your own friendships today. The science and engineering  divisional distribution requirement had me fearing the worst, especially as a gov and sociology major, but now, I am super grateful that exists, because it encouraged me to take this course that ordinarily, I would have thought of as not in my field and therefore something I couldn't handle. However, the way this course is taught, even those who don't do much in the way of evolutionary work will be just fine, and be able to engage fully with the material. The discussions about AI are especially fun throughout the course, and the readings always made me think. If you need any accommodations, as long as you communicate with the course staff about exactly what you need, they are flexible and will work with you. Finally, at least in the version of this course that I was in, we had a multiple choice quiz every few weeks, a research proposal where we were supposed to work with a bot to help design the research experiment. Then, we had one final project that comprised of a couple of different parts, including a creative component to highlight what we have learned throughout the semester. Other than the quizzes, which could sometimes be a bit stressful, all the assignments were a lot of fun, and really allowed us to explore this course. Overall a great class, and I definitely think you should take it for an amazing learning experience with an extremely supportive team.",
      "Wow. I really really disliked this course. I am not one to usually comment negatively on the Q report, as I feel really bad about doing that. And granted, the teaching staff are overall a sweet group of people. However, the lectures in this course were absolutely bizarre, chock full of tangents and changes in direction. After every class I felt confused as to what the central topic of the lecture was, and what information was important for exams. The exams were also horrible and confusing in content (EX: exam 1 had a question on brain parts, despite the Professor telling us explicitly and repeatedly that we did not need to know it for the test). Where the class really shined was the final segment of the course, which centered on AI and Evolution. I left wishing that the entire course had been about that topic, as that was by far the most bearable part of the class.",

      "This class is very fast–paced and can feel overwhelming at times, but I 100% recommend taking it. When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre–med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly –– if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night / Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget / overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments/psets/deliverables/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world–renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts/insights/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts –– they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text/shows you didn't read). It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading –– helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts / getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same / could benefit from your points / questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise/edit/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. I hope this information/advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.",

It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading –– helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts / getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same / could benefit from your points / questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise/edit/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. I hope this information/advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.",
      "Ok. Read the books pleaseee. I did not read them because I got so busy, and I really regret it, so much so that I intend to read them all over winter break.

      "This class is very fast–paced and can feel overwhelming at times, but I 100% recommend taking it. When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre–med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly –– if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night / Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget / overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments/psets/deliverables/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world–renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts/insights/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts –– they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text/shows you didn't read).

But, it is easy to get into a good flow with this class and the content is not too hard.  I would recommend going to lecture having already written the response paper because it can get very confusing quickly if you do not already have a direction set for the week.  Also, I would not take this course if you have never taken Art History before.  It pulls on analytical knowledge that is not specifically taught, especially with the final paper.  That being said, it is my favorite course I have taken and I loved going to lecture.  If you want to expand your knowledge of art and culture, this is the course for you.

      "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I have so many reasons, but the first is 1) you have no idea where your grade stands. It is all based on your response papers (which you don't get back ever and they're graded based on so much subjectivity it is frustrating) and your final project (which is not explained well AT ALL, it wasn't until the end of the semester when the idea of what the project was is truly fleshed out in section, its not fun) . 2) The communication in this course is awful, the final project prompt/deadlines weren't even posted onto the canvas site until after the first deadline and there is different things being told to different sections. If you have friends in other sections you guys will not cover the same material, nor will you have the same experience in the class overall. 3) There is too many components outside of this class apart from lecture, the looking lab is the most tedious to get through sometimes, often they don't benefit your understanding of the material and not to mention that if you miss one its not taken lightly. 4) Section is scary, if you don't go in super prepared with your readings highlighted and discussion points ready you're basically done for, two other people will dominate the discussion and your section leader won't make an effort to open the discussion up to everyone. If you voice the 'wrong opinion' you also will be verbally pushed into a corner until you agree with the rest of the section or your section leader. I found that often words were taken or even put into your mouth, it wasn't productive or fun.  I felt like I was the only one who felt this way about this class, but after speaking to others (most were declared HAA concentrators) I found out I was not the only one.

But more importantly, ASL is SO MUCH FUN, engaging, intellectual, emotional, and lively!! Its culture is so vibrant and being able to connect with others through signing is a completely different experience from talking with someone new. I was in Professor Tomita's section and she was an INCREDIBLE teacher. She made class so engaging and fun and really challenged us when it came to quizzes or assignments. Because of her, I already feel so comfortable with signing. With that being said, you will always get more from a class if you put more excitement and energy into it, so I suggest doing that as well! Practice in your free time, watch ASL videos or shows in ASL, read articles, etc. Go out of your way to find signers to practice with.

I learned so much like I can be pretty conversational in ASL after only a semester and I had so much fun in the class. She makes assignments super helpful but not at all stressful. She is super understanding and forgiving and really just wants you to learn. The only negative is meeting four days a week, but it really does make a difference in your ability to retain the language. It is such an important language for more people to know and Dr. Conlin teaches it so well. I just think you learn so much, but it is stress free which is the best of both worlds",

      "For fellow linguistics concentrators: take this course (it's required for your degree) if you can't wait until the spring to start LING material. For those who don't need it to fulfill a requirement, take LING 83 in the spring as this class will be difficult and take more time per week than you would wish for an intro–level course. Overall, interesting material, albeit with a heavy syntax bias in the presentation. You can't slack off throughout this course, but if you are willing to pay attention and put in the work, it will be rewarding and relatively simple to pass with an A/A–. P–Sets were collaborative and often resubmittable, which made them less intimidating (try to make a few friends/study buddies in your class to check answers with before you submit!) –– but the P–Sets WERE difficult, so keep that in mind. The course moves FAST and, while the teaching staff is enthusiastically willing to help, my TF was not very helpful when answering questions. Make sure to attend Bondarenko's Office Hours if you're looking for a quick question and answer.Overall, not horrible but I'd steer clear if I wasn't 100% interested in linguistics in all of its lovely, pedantic glory –– but for all those who truly adore Ling, take the class! I personally enjoyed it.",
      "This class is very interesting. The grading can be quite odd (Some assignments allow multiple attempts and points were taken off on my second attempt for things that the TF had marked correct on my first, the TF took points off for questions I didn’t answer even though they were written nowhere on the assignment sheet), but the professor and TF were receptive to asking about the grading in all cases but one. The lectures and sections are very information heavy, but sometimes things are not taught and then tested on the psets. The exams are not hard because they’re open book, and you can drop either a pset, the midterm, or the final, which makes this class very chill.",

Pretty accessible to beginners, even those with no background in linguistics. This course is very very new in the department so it's still working out some course logistics, but I'm confident the subsequent versions of this course will be strong. Robert is a highly approachable professor, and genuinely enjoys teaching this content. Assignments and projects definitely required time and effort, but were very manageable. A great addition to the linguistics department, and a great choice for anyone interested in these concepts. That being said, the class is pretty introductory, so if you have an extensive background in these concepts, some of the content might feel rudimentary or repetitive. However, the course does provide additional depth to these topics, so maybe talk to Robert first to figure out if this course is right for you. But if you're someone who already enjoys sociolinguistics and dabbles in learning about this for fun, you'll definitely enjoy this course even if it covers something you already know.",

Lectures are entertaining and interesting for those with an interest in the content, and assignments are honestly pretty fun to do (emphasis: NOT easy! but fun to figure out! go to office hours!). This course had some of the most enjoyable exams I ever had because they were intellectually stimulating and challenging without being stressful (how was this possible? i do not know, yet it was). You DO need to put effort into this course – the content is not trivial, and gets pretty complex further in the course, so you do need to be able to understand what is happening from the start for you to really know how to do the assignments later on. Think of it a little bit like how you need to be able to do basic math first before doing more complex calculations. There is no math in this course, but the concepts build on one another in a similar way, and attempting to absorb readings through sheer will without comprehending them will not work. Even if you don't have a deep love for morphology per se, you will come away from this course with a way of thinking about systems and universals across languages that I think are relevant in any field. It will teach you to think beyond what has been conventionally taught, and be creative+rational in imagining alternative explanations for concepts we simply do not have answers to yet. Prof Bobaljik and Anabelle were wonderful teachers, and incredible lovely people. This has been one of my favorite linguistics courses at Harvard.",

The content isn't necessarily hard, but if you have never seen the linguistic symbols before, or never learned the rules of when certain processes happen in language, then this might be a fast paced course for you, as it was for me. The content is interesting, but especially at the start of the semester it will be a fair bit of reading, requiring you to read about 2 chapters in the textbook a week. If you are going to take this class, especially if you don't have that much experience with linguistics, you need to read the readings; they help explain a lot of concepts that might not be focused that much in lecture, but are needed to help your understanding of the content to come. In regards to coding in R, you are not asked to do anything crazy, but if you have never used R before, be prepared to spend lots of time troubleshooting small mistakes that will make the PSETs take so much longer than they really should have. This isn't a huge deal as we spend about 2–3 weeks on this, but R is needed for the final exam, so make sure you are prepared. I would say that if you are going to take the class use resources like R tutoring if you need it and office hours.",

If you are deciding between math ma/1a I would really ask yourself if you think you are capable of putting in the work. Math Ma really tries to fill in gaps, whereas 1a may assume you know some stuff already. The Math M sequence is 2 semesters, however, I do feel way more confident in math. MATT KING YOU ARE THE BEST!! LITERALLY A KING, that’s why it’s in his name. Shout out to his 12pm MWF class. I literally disliked math before this but this class really made enjoy learning math. It really comes to show that a nice environment is needed. Math Ma provides a safe and fun environment to learn math. I LOVE YOU GUYS!For context: I didn’t take calculus in high. I took precalculus in high school but 2 years ago, additionally the content wasn’t ever truly mastered.",

I was placed in Math MA for both the online placement and the skill check but I decided to trust my gut and take this course and it was the best decision. For context, I took AP Calc AB and I got a 3 on the exam.  If you have any prior calc experience, you should be completely fine to take this class instead of Math M. They will try to scare you into switching into MA at the beginning of the course but don't be deterred.Speaking of the beginning of the course, the first three weeks are absolutely the roughest. Three psets a week is exhausting but you will get used to it! Also, they take the most points off of the psets in the beginning so don't let that discourage you either. Focus on learning how your specific CAs grade and what they take points off for. The key to getting full points on the psets is either going to the mqc (ideally on the night that the pset is assigned, not when its due) or having a really solid pset group.Exams aren't terrible, the questions are always easier versions of pset problems. Your biggest enemy will be time. The group portions of the midterms were awful though but you can consult with other groups so you should be able to get full points no matter what.Overall, only take this class if you have to because it is a large time commitment. There are less time consuming ways to fulfill your distributions. But if you have to take it for your concentration, you can do it don't be discouraged!!",

This course moves way too fast for someone without some calculus background to keep up. Most people in my section had some calculus background and agreed with me on this point. The Math Question Center, helpful in theory, is crowded and frustrating in practice, so don't expect it to always come in clutch for you. Expect exams beyond the difficulty the course demands, and limited instruction from actual people (teaching yourself with premade worksheets is better, we seem to have decided?)",

Three psets a week is exhausting but you will get used to it! Also, they take the most points off of the psets in the beginning so don't let that discourage you either. Focus on learning how your specific CAs grade and what they take points off for. The key to getting full points on the psets is either going to the mqc (ideally on the night that the pset is assigned, not when its due) or having a really solid pset group.Exams aren't terrible, the questions are always easier versions of pset problems. Your biggest enemy will be time. The group portions of the midterms were awful though but you can consult with other groups so you should be able to get full points no matter what.Overall, only take this class if you have to because it is a large time commitment. There are less time consuming ways to fulfill your distributions. But if you have to take it for your concentration, you can do it don't be discouraged!!",
      "Look into other options. Three psets a week is too many if you're not passionate about math. You will seldom know peace. If you have no calculus background, take MA. This course moves way too fast for someone without some calculus background to keep up. Most people in my section had some calculus background and agreed with me on this point. The Math Question Center, helpful in theory, is crowded and frustrating in practice, so don't expect it to always come in clutch for you. Expect exams beyond the difficulty the course demands, and limited instruction from actual people (teaching yourself with premade worksheets is better, we seem to have decided?)",

      "This is a very standard calculus class that you'll probably have to take if you're a premed or concentrating in the life sciences. The 3 PSETs a week were bothersome and I often felt like my life was constantly revolving around math, but office hours and MQC were some of the best resources to help me in this course I practically lived at MQC and was there almost every night that they offered it. I came into this class having done AP Calc BC in high school, so none of the concepts in this course were new and I was able to relax with this course. In this class, we had to follow a hands–on style where instead of sitting down in a lecture–style section, we had to spend the whole time at the board trying to solve problems in groups before even being taught the lesson, which I dreaded everyday. However, the staff in this class are so kind and generous with their time. Mario, Sina, and Andrew are some of the best instructors I have come across in college. The exams are pretty fair and similar to the PSET problems, which I appreciated.",
      "I would not recommended you taking this class unless you absolutely have to. However, I feel like I understand math and have less math anxiety after taking this course. Their way of teaching is making you go to the board and solve problems and you won’t get through majority of the worksheet in class, and they won’t tell you to look over it or complete it on your own but you should to fully understand the material. They are also not the best if you want a 1 on 1 session and will tell you no, so if you’re struggling with a concept you have to go to office hours or MCQ both of which are packed. TLDR: get help earlier rather than later in this class, as all the students have already likely taken Calc BC and so instructors unconsciously breeze through topics.",

      "I would caution other students against this course unless you absolutely need this class for your concentration or have prior calc experience!! While this class is laid out in a clear and organized manner and there is a lot of support available outside of class (office hours and MQC), it is extremely frustrating. It takes a lot of time and some times is unnecessarily difficult. For context, my feedback is from the perspective of someone who has never taken calculus before, but did well in pre–calculus and MFI. Despite being an introductory calc class, I feel you absolutely need previous knowledge (at least in calc 1) to do well in this class. For the PSets, they are often very long and can take upwards to 5 hours per PSet, if you have never taken calc before. They are do–able if you attend office hours and MQC consistently; however, 3 PSets a week for 4–5 hours each is a lot to ask of students for an introductory calculus class. Also, there were occasional questions on PSets that were not taught, or it was clear we shouldn't be expected to know something (like the CAs in MQC would also be confused on how we would be expected to learn how to approach a problem without the answer key guiding them in the right direction for them to help us). Also, I had a big section of more than 30 students, which differs from the 15 students promoted for each section. I heard from peers in other sections that they had similar class sizes too. Note that a vast majority of the students in the class have taken calculus before; it often feels as if you are very behind if you haven't. With this in mind, the class format where we are pushed to try to figure out worksheets alone at the white board first often looked like student without calc knowledge struggling to keep up, while those students with prior calculus experience just rushes through the problem. One of the only wonderful things about this course is the teaching team. All the teaching fellows are extremely kind and caring, and they care about your learning.",

      "3 problem sets a week make things automatically challenging. As with most math classes here (at least I presume), the workload will be a lot but it's just something you have to do if it's a concentration requirement. Go to MQC and find PSET buddies. Find a TF whose office hours are the most helpful to your learning style. Go into this course anticipating the rigor and immediately start setting yourself up for success. I should have implemented better studying/learning strategies much earlier on than I did. Luckily, the course team really provides a lot of opportunities to seek help, which I appreciate. On the bright side, this may be a challenging course, but the collaborative aspect can make things enjoyable (especially if you have a midday section, like 1:30 pm). I met a lot of people through this course that I don't think I would have otherwise met! I didn't expect the course to feel so social. You'll bond over all your Math 1A frustrations, and honestly, it's *really* hard to get through this course on your own. Also, just a quick note: the first few lessons felt the most difficult. 1. I wasn't used to the structure and 2. Topics can feel overcomplicated because the team wants you to really understand why certain mathematical concepts operate as they do. For example, I didn't have a strong background in calc going into this class, but I know others that did who were frustrated because we weren't allowed to do things we weren't taught yet. We had to do things a very specific way at first, and as the course progresses, so does your \"toolbox\" per se, which makes things easier I suppose.",

Unless you want to make your semester a living hell do not take Math 1A if the second examd did not placed you into it.

With the heavy workload that exhausts you each week, it is prety difficult to outperform those poeple. Math 1A is good for those who just needed some practice. Otherwise, it felt at times like they assumed and expected we would know much more than was described in the syllabus.

This class is great for building confidence in your math skills; the CAs and instructors do a great job of leading you to understanding problems rather than giving solutions right away and it's honestly very helpful for developing these foundational skills.

If you are taking this class, here is my general experience. Midterms/Finals are a lot easier than the practice tests but follow the same sort of structure. So, if you feel comfortable with the practices, you'll likely do well on the exam. I didn't really utilize MQC or office hours, but I do have friends who found them super helpful.

      "It's important that you have taken calc AB and I would say taking Calc BC in high school was definitly really helpful. At first I tried 21a, had a bad teacher and then I was kinda just like why am I doing this when I only need up to 1a for premed requirement so then I went to this and I liked it a lot better.  Also, I think about 60% of the material from calc BC is applicable in this class, we definitly learn more than just that content. Andd comparing to BC and AB again, in this class and math at harvard generally, I would say that it is much harder htan highschool where in AP calc for me I would just learn a formula an memorize it (which I liked) but here you learn how we derive a thereom which is cool but also a lot more work. Also, go to Math question center to udnerstand and check your problem sets (homework) it was super helpful for me. But other than that, good class!",
      "It is a lot of psets and in my opinion not worth it if your concentration requires higher level math. I thought it would be useful to ease into, but instead I was fighting to stay afloat in a class I already passed in high school.",

      "If you need to learn multi and you're in Econ, absolutely take this class over 21a. Roderic is the best, and he makes himself available for office hours, even outside of the ones he has posted. The PSets start out pretty easy (less than 1.5 hours per PSet), but some of the later ones took me a few hours, so make sure to at least budget a good amount of time and work with a good group/go to OH. Our CAs were also great and provided a lot of times for us to work on PSets.My only criticism is that the class gets a little confusing after the first and second midterms, and I wish Roderic spent more time explicitly teaching some of the more difficult techniques in class. Otherwise, if you don't understand the new ideas when you work on problems with your table at the chalkboards, you won't understand anything for the rest of class. This isn't terrible, since I think Roderic is really amazing at explaining things one–one in office hours, but something to watch out for. Overall, though, definitely a super painless math class. I came in as a sophomore, having taken BC Calc in HS and nothing Freshman year. I reviewed basic integration techniques and calc concepts over the summer (just on Khan Academy), which was very helpful but not strictly necessary. If you're worried, like I was, that we'd use more advanced calc class, don't be. You don't need trig–sub, series, etc. I think we might've used integration by parts once or twice? But most of the time when we integrated it was just reverse power rule, very simple. The hard part of this class is understanding the concepts, not actually doing the math (since you don't even need a calculator for the class).",

      "Most truthful opinion about Math19a:this class traumatized me but this is still one of the most amazing and rewarding classes I have ever taken. This class changed my perspective on math and life sciences! Professor Wes is the kindest person ever. He genuinely cares so much about this class and the students. He will help if you ask him. (I literally asked him to teach me about the most basic things in course and he always was so enthusiastic about teaching and learning) He genuinely will help you if you just email him. He did say he sympathises with the students a lot because he knows the class and its expectations.The class is difficult. Especially if you are coming straight from AP Calculus BC. That said, I was recommended for MAth ma twice but I chose to take this class. Keep in mind i had excellent grades in Pre Calculus and calc bc and got a five on the test. But, this class is still challenging. There are no MQC or help–rooms, only office hours from CA and Wes, BUT these are more than enough. They are so so helpful. Make sure you form a study group/pset group it will help. Start psets early. I know everyone says this but to be caught up with this class, this is so so necessary. Like, other math classes do not have intensive readings and very fast paced lectures that never seem to stop. SO START EARLY. find your buddies. changed my life when i went into the weekend knowing i tried to do the pset fully even though i skipped some questions. PSETS are meant to be challenging, dont get discouraged. YOu will get a hang of it. Midterms are tough, learn to manage your time. I would not say they are not representative of the class lectures or the psets. Start studying for it early! Do your cheat sheet! Put whatever Wes gives you on the cheatsheet because it will help.The final project is what makes this class very different. But the professor is there with you every step of the way! He literally will work through thanksgiving break for you. Very very helpful and never denies to help.Take this class IF: you are very curious, dont think grades are everything that matter over learning. If you're a pre–med, although you do not have to be. If you want to look at life sciences from a different perspective that will change everything. If you want research experience with a really amazing professor and class environment.Don't take this class if you are not the above things.Be cautious. It is not hard to get good grades in teh class if you start early and study hard. Very very rewarding. Would not take this class again but I am eternally grateful I did once.",

      "This was the first math class I've taken in 3–4 years, and I was really nervous going into it that I'd fail miserably. I've never been that comfortable with math. However, I think reading the course evals mentally prepared me for what was to come, and I tried to overprepare in the beginning to control my success as much as possible. For example, I did the Review2Preview module before the class started and wrote down all my questions about things (even simple stuff like how limits/Reimann sums worked). That module helped prepare me a LOT. I'd read the textbook chapters and watch the Panopto videos before class (try to ALWAYS watch the videos!! they are so useful!). I also went to MQCs and office hours when I could, checking my work with other students. Office hours + MQCs gave me the confidence I needed to know I could do well in the class, as everyone was so encouraging.The first unit was the hardest for me, for sure. After midterm 1, I developed a better gauge for what to expect out of the class. They emphasized that \"struggling is learning\" and active learning is your path to success in this class. Make group chats with other students, work on homework with them, use your resources. My best studying tools for midterms were: (1) review notes, (2) write down ANY questions you have and ask your TF after class or in MQC/office hours/workshops, (3) make Quizlets to memorize rules/theorems/equations, (4) do ALL of the practice exams and write down questions/flag problems you aren't sure of the solution for and bring those to TF/MQC/office hours. The practice exams are absolutely the key to doing well on the exam.Finally, spread the Psets out over two days or \"sessions.\" Doing it all at once can be overwhelming. If I can succeed in this class, I think pretty much anyone can, you just have to believe in your ability to do it.",

When you do them, try to be aware of the processes you go through to solve problems because creating that tool kit is an essential part of succeeding in this class.

      "Math 21a was my first math class at Harvard and I took it a senior majoring in Ec and Gov. Taking it was one of the best decisions I made in my time at Harvard. It made me wonder whether I should have been a math concentrator. Eva is absolutely amazing. She is such an incredible teacher and knows how to teach the content, keep everyone engaged, and make it fun. The pace of the class is perfect. Doing three problem sets a week is a lot of work but honestly, I looked forward to getting started on the problem sets. The math department at Harvard is absolutely incredible and does an insanely good job at math pedagogy. I definitely recommend taking 21a. It had been about 4 years since I last did math and still I found myself really enjoying 21a. The summer/winter before you take it, I would recommend quickly going over integration techniques, which I did not do but which probably would have benefited me a bit. The class is super visual and when you take it, you can literally feel yourself getting smarter and feel your brain thinking about things in ways that it is not used to thinking about things. At some point in the semester, I started having math dreams about problems from the class and it was super fun. Amazing class. If you can take it with Eva, that'll make it a hundred thousand times better. If you're a freshman or sophomore who used to like math back in high school but now are concentrating in a non–STEM subject and wondering whether you should take math or not, let this be your sign to take the plunge and take math.

You also have many resources available to prepare for exams with pset practice and the practice exams made available to ensure you are ready for exams!",

Take notes before, during class, and after if you can because the jump from the worksheets to problem sets and exams is a bit difficult.

Three psets a week may seem like a lot, but it truly helps you retain the material and keeps you on top of your work, and as time goes on you'll realize it actually does not take up that much time. As long as you take the time to really understand the homework while you are completing it, TAKE THE PRACTICE EXAMS, and actively participate in class, you will succeed. For me, this course started out pretty easy, and then got more difficult towards the middle of the semester when you get to triple integration/vector problem solving, but then it leveled out again. I would HIGHLY recommend going through the solutions for the worksheets after class/whenever you start the pset to internalize the concepts you learned in class––this becomes very useful during exam time. I had a slightly more inexperienced TF (absolutely amazing CAs though), but in a way this motivated me to go through the material on my own time, and I was able to do well both on the psets and on the exams. All in all, I am so glad I took this class, and it was one of the highlights of my semester.",

      "Think long and hard about which math course you take. Any sense of hubris you have, get rid of it. This course may not be Math 25 or 55, but for someone who has never done Linear algebra, proofwriting, or set theory, you may very well still find yourself feeling a bit challenged. I took A LONG time to adapt to this course. Professor Wood is a great guy, and you can tell he is enthusiastic about what he does, but I must admit I felt so lost up until a few lectures after the second Midterm. To be entirely honest, I am not completely sure if its because I am just a slow student, or maybe lectures weren't as clear as they could be, but let me tell you, I really suffered my first semester because of this class. I didn't really know how to do the PSETS, the first two midterms didn't go so great for me, and there were days when I severely doubted myself. I was also taking some other Pset courses, so the workload was definitely weighing on me, so if you are a first–year student also doing a lot of STEM–related courses, please make sure you know how to manage your time properly regardless of which math course you pick.Just know this course might either be a complete breeze for you, or a warzone. It really depends on who you are. I certainly think Wood's lectures were much better towards the latter half of the semester, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying them (a very stark contrast to what I felt towards the start of the semester). I also think that all things considered, because it was his first time teaching this course, it wasn't that bad. I certainly believe he will do a better job next fall, and well, I have enough faith in this that I'm sticking with 22b and not dropping to 21a. If you do end up taking this course and struggle, please please please go to office hours. They saved me, and they will save you too. The CAs and TFs for this course were amazing (shout out to Zak, Josh, and Mitchell), and Dr. Wood is also particularly helpful and insightful during his office hours.All in all, like I said before, really think about what math course you take. Do I regret taking 22a? Honestly, at first, I thought it would be a resounding yes, but honestly, the course grew on me. Yeah I struggled a ton, and you might too, but it's in those moments where you truly learn who you are as a person and a student. The truth is, I may not leave this course with the greatest grade in the world, but I learned things from Wood's lectures, I learned things from the other students I worked with, and I learned a lot from my study sessions. So I guess take 22a if you're like me, unsure about where to start with math at Harvard, not wanting to do something as extreme as 25 or 55, but wanting a little more to prepare you at the start of your college journey.",
      "To preface, this is coming not from a student that didn't do well in the class, but from someone who eventually got an A in the course. At first, I decided to pay close attention to the lectures and the lecturer, but after the first and second midterms, I quickly realized that the reason I was not doing well is because the lectures do not properly cover the material at all. Professor Wood just does problems on the board without teaching students how to properly think through the problems, which does not work at all. In fact, reading through the textbook also revealed that some of the concepts we learned in lecture were taught in completely the wrong way. After this, I decided to not pay attention to the lecturer and learn on my own, and this resulted in me doing well on the third midterm and the final. My success in the course was due to the fact that I realized how terrible the professor is at teaching and learned how to teach the concepts to myself. If you are somehow that prioritizes productive lectures and a professor who actually teaches properly, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",

For context, going into the class, I did not know how to write proofs, had some linear algebra background, and was an AIME qualifier. The class was difficult but very manageable and taught me so much about mathematical thinking. I had no idea I would enjoy theoretical math so much. Wes is an amazing lecturer and clearly cares a lot about his students. I heard a lot about the 55 community but I genuinely think the 25 community is way better. Our class is half the size (around 20 students), so everyone knows each other and I've made some really good friends through this course. The CAs are so good and helpful and chill.However, this class is a big time commitment. If you want to explore a million things in your first semester here, you might want to consider a different course. Also, exams are really hard and there is no curve, so take into consideration how comfortable you are with taking timed tests before choosing 25. If you are on the fence, I would recommend starting in 25 and dropping down to 22 if you think its not for you. 22 is a LOT easier but its a much larger class and you will learn a lot less.",

      "Now, to get it out of the way, yes, this class is stupidly difficult. The analogy of drinking water from a firehose is not at all inaccurate and I would not recommend taking it alongside more than one other really difficult course (like physics 16,CS61 from what I've heard for example) – it is possible, but it will likely crush you. One other really difficult course is doable if you're very comfortable with, I have friends that have done it, but they were in a position where those courses were very commensurate with their skill level. Nonetheless, despite the extreme difficulty, I would still recommend this course as strongly as I am capable if you love math. You do NOT have to be a genius with boatloads of competition mathematics experience in order to take this class. The highest level of mathematics I ever did formally in high school was single variable calculus and the basics of complex numbers and some very very elementary proofs, and I was still able to score above average in the course without sacrificing my entire life on its altar. I would however say that it is quite difficult to do well in the class without at least one of the following:– Some experience in high school with more advanced mathematics, especially linear algebra. This is not so much because it will directly come up as something tested in the course, as although we do spend a lot of time on linear algebra it takes a form almost unrecognizable to many of my friends who did linear algebra in high school, but rather because it gives useful intuition as to how to think concretely about very abstract concepts, and a concrete example to reach for when you want to play around with a new idea. – Exposure to and interest in abstract mathematics. This was what I had that I felt helped me the most. This doesn't need to be formal – most of my background came from a nigh–unhealthy amount of mathematics youtube videos watched as well as having worked through the beginnings of several lecture notes covering the beginnings of a couple of the university–level subjects I was interested in. These do not need to be directly related to the course material at all, but rather help get you in the mindset of abstract mathematics – figuring out how to set up a proof, how to see the kinds of patterns and tricks that come up in abstract math, and also just to enjoy the little references to other fields of mathematics that often come up. The course basically assumes being comfortable with this mode of thinking and although you can pick it up along the way, trial by fire and all that, it does help to have it already.With that out of the way, a final couple notes on the difficulty of the course: firstly, although it is indeed incredibly difficult, that difficulty is fairly frontloaded in that it doesn't get too much worse than the first couple problem sets (not that it gets much easier either, but it does mean that if you survive the first couple weeks without completely burning yourself up you can likely survive the rest) and secondly, again despite that difficulty the grading is relatively lenient, and as long as you solve the problems you will likely score quite well. This is especially true of the fact that extensive collaboration is tolerated and actively encouraged by the course – it becomes much much more manageable once you find a good problem set group to work through it with and the scope of what kind of collaboration is permitted is quite broad. A tip on study groups – try and find a group with a roughly comparable skill level to yours in the class, as being in a problem set group with someone much more or less mathematically able than you is generally not very productive for either party. This also helps with another issue that I found to be quite common: impostor syndrome. Since many people taking this course would have been the resident math whiz at their high school but are just another student in this class it can often be easy to feel as if you don't really deserve to be in the class, and having a group of people around you who are going through the same sort of thing and have a similar skill level to you can really help with that. That said, it also helps to have a group of people whose skills complement each other – the joke in my pset group was always that we had the logician (me), the physicist, and the generalist mathematician, and our respective orientations helped a lot with building solutions together; I could often spot slight technicalities that the other two missed, the physicist had very strong concrete intuitions for things and could see angles we couldn't, and the generalist mathematician often had a lot of insights that I was too deep in the weeds to see and that weren't the physicist's style. Now as to the professor. I do not exaggerate when I say Denis Auroux is the BEST professor I have ever had in any academic context. He is a brilliant, lucid lecturer who takes incredibly deep, intricate concepts that I personally would have had to spend many times the number of hours we had to understand otherwise and makes them crystal clear and motivated. He always makes sure to really work through the details of why a result is true while keeping it approachable and comprehensible, which is a terribly difficult balance to strike. He was also eminently available to all of his students – he generally responds to slack questions within minutes (he's so quick that it's become something of a joke amongst classmates) and his office hours are pure gold. He makes a conscious effort in them to make sure every single question is heard and answered throughly and he gives incredibly well thought out hints. One can also very clearly tell how much he cares about his students – he takes the time to get to know each of their idiosyncrasies and work with them. He's also just very approachable and willing to laugh with you. The CAs are also as a whole excellent, giving incredibly useful advice on the problems and having office hours on all but one day of the week.As for the content, it is incredibly deep and interesting (although in order to cover so much it is done at incredibly breakneck pace). The main areas covered are group theory (up to and including the Sylow approach to classification of finite groups), abstract linear algebra (with a stringent focus on doing things rigorously and thoroughly, which makes it look very different to the kind of linear algebra many will have done in high school since we don't do much at all with matrix computations, for example even defining the determinant is the last thing we do in the linear algebra section of the course), and their intersection in the form of representation theory. This is covered in the lectures, but a lot of the growth in the course happens in the problem sets. These are generally 8–12 questions in length and will unless you are really brilliant take you most of the week to solve – finishing a math 55 pset is always a bright moment in the week. The problems are very rarely computational and often force you to be very creative in coming up with a solution. The advantage fo this very heavy problem set workload though is tat generally speaking because they force you to become so intimately familiar with the material in order to solve them you generally have to do very little studying outside of just doing the problem sets.Finally, I just want to issue a final recommendation to please, if you do love math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It will be hard, it will eat up a lot of your time, but you will come out a better mathematician than I daresay any other class at any other university could have made you. I can deal with mathematical problems and concepts now that I could never have even begun to wrap my head around before taking this course, and I am much more confident in my ability to actually contribute to complex math. Furthermore, the content itself is just too beautiful to pass up – you will prove results just in the problem sets that are themselves substantial and will make you wonder at the beauty of math. There are very few other experiences that have made me marvel at the sheer beauty of the thing quite as much as math 55. It has been hands down my favourite course of my first semester and quite possibly my favourite academic experience full stop. If you love math and are willing to really put a lot of time into it and want to beecome a better mathematician, this course will be life–changing. There is nothing else quite like math 55.",
      "Start psets early, and for office hours, don't be afraid to talk to Auroux. Auroux is way more knowledgeable than CAs and he answers questions in a timely manner. Often, just talking to him about a problem for 5 minutes creates a breakthrough for a problem that you have been dealing with for hours.",

      "Incredible class! Demarco is the best you could hope for. The course is a great introduction to pure math for anyone with absolutely no background in it. It assumes no prior knowledge and really builds up your proof–writing abilities from ground zero. Demarco's lecture notes are wonderful, and the other texts in the course basically just provide further detail. The p–sets are pretty difficult, especially at the beginning, but they seem to get easier throughout the semester as you get the hang of things. I would say the level of the problems was pretty perfect, because it felt challenging and interesting but it really was something that we would be able to do. The CA's are really great and offer tons of OH for when you are stuck. The structure of the classes is that the first half or so is lecture, then you spend the next half working in groups on worksheet problems (usually short proofs). It is super valuable practice and a great time to get feedback from CA's. There was even more practice available in the weekly sections. Exams were not as challenging as homeworks and did not feel too rushed for a class period. All of this feedback comes with the caveat that things may be different under a different instructor, and Demarco won't be teaching next year. However, I think this class is generally well–run and a good introduction to the field if you have an interest. Also, if you ever get a chance to take a class with Demarco, take it!!",

      "Oh boy... Real Analysis. First and foremost, there is no getting around this. This class is hard. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly: The good: This is a difficult class, which sometimes can be made more difficult due to: idiosyncracies, arbitrary grading, and unnecessary difficulty on assignments. YMMV,  but there wasn't a lot of that under Prof. Max Weinreich. That's not to say the class was perfect. But it also was not horrible.  Max was a great lecturer, but a little monotone sometimes. He was hard to reach outside of class/OH. The midterm was fair and we got a nice curve. The bad: However, some things you should know: Your experience in the class will depend a lot on who the professor is, and how many times you go to office hours a week. Some Psets were easy and doable, others were near impossible unless you went to OH. There were two WONDERFUL CA's, but other CAs were not as good. The first few Psets will be graded as if you were a mathematician, and errors will cost you. Then, they relax the grading. This tends to be due to different reasons, but I like to think is to give you a false sense of improvement. There's arbitrary grading and you should reach out when this happens. The ugly: Some problems were hard enough that CAs even had trouble solving them. If a CA doesn't know how to solve a problem... that will tell you. This is my general guideline: If the Prof is writing their problems, you'll be ok. If they are choosing problems from Rudin, then good luck. This was a WAY better class than last Fall, which under all metrics was a horrible experience for everyone. The final exam was rough. Instead of testing knowledge of a definition or theorem, you need to realize \"the trick\" that each problem requires. This is more on intuition than true knowledge. We were given a review sheet of 10 problems and told to study it intensely. Only 3 problems showed up in the final and one of them was *heavily* modified. It should have been a take–home or something. TLDR: Max is good, other profs may not be. OH is the most valuable resource for Psets. If exams are in person, they will be difficult but hopefully curved. Find friends and build a study group!",

It's a great class regardless of whether you plan to study more theoretical math or not.In terms of content, I would say it is pretty manageable especially if you have some background in abstract algebra (i.e. linear algebra or further) and/or proof–writing, though definitely not a necessary pre–req. Homework is weekly, a bit on the longer side (occasionally some rather tedious exercises) but quite straightforward (takes around 10 hours at most, and Harris is super lenient about extensions). The main textbook (D&F) and class content align pretty closely, so it is helpful to look at. The final follows very closely from homework so if you do well on psets/understand how to do the problems then you should be set! My only minor concern throughout is that we get feedback on homework quite late, though homework solutions are posted for reference which is nice. Overall a really good class :)",
      "Fake class unfortunately. Joe is a very illuminating lecturer, but he is hindered by a.) answering every question, even the extremely stupid ones, with 10–15 minute–long tangents, and b.) not knowing what is on the psets and therefore covering topics completely out of sequence, sometimes covering material necessary for homeworks after they are due. These two things combined made me feel that, even though I would often leave with some kernels of useful intuition, attending lecture was on the whole a waste of time, and so I stopped attending after the first 2 or 3 weeks.Another issue I had was that the homeworks, while mostly fine, sometimes contained extremely tedious, useless problems for seemingly no reason (e.g. verify that these theorems hold for this group by checking all 20+ cases), which really gave me the impression that Joe had both not written the homeworks and also had no idea what was on them. By the start of finals, we had gotten back 2 of the 11 homeworks, so there was also no real way to gauge one's performance or level of learning in the class; I also suspect, writing this the day before grades come out, that our final exams were never graded or looked at. I understand that this is kind of just how math classes are at Harvard, but it really did not fill me with confidence about this course.Take if you love self–studying and reading terrible textbooks.

Also, group theory is a hard requirement despite what it says on my.harvard. Really should have done 122 before this (55 of course maybe can take at same time).

It's a bit sad because I feel like we didn't get the standard course where we learn from day 1 the definition of tensors, manifolds, etc. Instead we did a lot of calculation and plugging in formulas. It's cool and the course felt a bit on the lighter side but I was wishing I'd get a more rigorous introduction to such a cool topic.

      "Professor Siu’s Math 213A was an interesting and beautiful course. As my second exposure to complex analysis, I have come away with it with a much better intuition and understanding of the intuition and ideas of the field, which is testament to Professor Siu’s excellent lecturing and lecture notes – they are geared towards panoramic understanding of the field and how it connects to other fields of mathematics, emphasising that the beauty of analysis lies in the use and creation of its tools (kernels, series/ product expansions, the symmetries of certain special functions considered, and the ideas of growth order and factorisation) and drawing parallels between real and complex analysis whenever relevant to fortify understanding of both. The narrative of the course stuck very closely to the historical development of the field, which made the topics feel very naturally motivated and the flow of ideas much more coherent than I have seen in most other analysis courses. Problem sets were written well and made the material familiar, though a couple of them (with the glaring example being the final exam which took me upwards of 50 hours to finish) were too long in my opinion and could be shortened to around 75% of their current length and still serve their purpose, though the three signature problems of the course on the Bergman kernel, Koebe’s construction of Riemann mappings, and the ‘triangle tessalation’ problem were all very interesting and memorable. With this change implemented though, this definitely has the potential to be one of the best courses I have ever taken.",
      "Very good class on complex analysis. This class is famously extremely hard (back in the day when Siu used to teach it a few years ago), but I got the sense that he really listened to past QGuide feedback and toned down the course by quite a lot. This meant that we covered a lot less than what he intended to teach (so no Gelfond–Schneider, no univalent function theory, etc.) but we got to cover the topics we did in much greater depth (including many cool topics such as Nevanlinna theory, elliptic function theory). One gripe I have is that Siu would often repeat lectures (as in he'd start the next lecture saying the exact same thing he said the previous lecture), but I totally get it and it helps me revise a lot as well.The workload is very lightweight. Siu wants the homeworks to be trivial extensions of the lecture material where we get the chance to get our hands dirty working with the material, and it indeed was exactly what he intended. Each homework took me less than a day and helped me understand class material a lot more (homework problems were strictly either Stein Shakarchi Complex Analysis problems or his own problems extending ideas / proofs from his lecture materials). The final was a slightly longer homework, and this was also very doable. Overall, I really enjoyed this class, and it certainly finds its place as one of the classes that fundamentally shape my mathematics education.",

Sure, it's not easy, but it seems to be at an appropriate difficulty for what a graduate mathematics class should be in my opinion. You will get out of this course what you put into it. I highly recommend reading and understanding the lecture notes BEFORE lecture, because lectures will go extremely fast and be hard to follow otherwise. If you do this, you may well enjoy the material and some of the interesting proofs and ideas. Professor Drozd is also not that bad (I think he is one of the better professors in the math department), but he is very hard of hearing, which means asking questions can be... challenging at best. Lectures are fairly dry, but this is to be expected from a highly technical proof–based course.",

      "Professor Freed’s Math 230 was intense. The course itself was very very challenging – it moved at a rapid pace that was quite difficult to follow along, with proofs of theorems covered not necessarily presented in the most digestible manner (like many other geometers/topologists, Prof Freed drew excellent pictures but was not as clear at bringing out the logic behind the pictures he drew). The accompanying lecture notes were both really long and really dense, which together with the fact that DG is a subject with a lot of hard–to–grasp definitions and is heavily reliant on quick recall of all facts from undergraduate Diff Top (for which apparently Harvard does not regularly offer a sufficiently in–depth course certain years) made them really overwhelming to navigate. Also, in an effort to present the material in a way that emphasises the power of certain tools (for example, the Maurer Cartan form), it seemed as though some of the intuition that might otherwise be present was obscured, though perhaps this is because I am yet to grasp what was being explained to me completely. The problem sets though were mostly very interesting and I appreciated the number of opportunities there were to explore topology–/ analysis–adjacent ideas which really shed light on how important and wide reaching DG is as a field – it was also nice that there was a ‘build your own problem set’ kind of aspect to the course in order that the class remained educational but not overwhelming. Also, Professor Freed is one of the kindest professors in the maths department and cares most fundamentally about our enjoyment of learning and doing mathematics which is great. Overall, a very daunting class if you are expecting to understand everything the first time through, though as Prof Freed says, growing comfortable with being confused is an essential part of being a researcher, and with this in mind this was overall a good course, and I am definitely excited to keep coming back to the lecture notes to grasp all the magic he has brought to us.",

Sure, by extending the definitions you sometimes get interesting, new, structures, but missing one definition in these sorts of things can confuse a lecture because everything builds. But Colin was AWESOMe w examples and clarifying, which made it way easier to follow even with patchy understanding.

I personally did not enjoy Perusall as a reading tool, and I felt that participation was assessed too methodically. Many of us participated just for the points, and given our limited background in the subject, it was difficult to ask productive questions or make insightful remarks.Javiera is very enthusiastic and approachable, and she genuinely tries to make the class enjoyable!

      "Ls1a is exactly what the title says ––– an integrated introduction to the life sciences. I think that Ls1a had an excellent curriculum, and masterfully blended chemistry and biology topics, which made each topic more digestible and understandable. I strongly encourage taking Ls1a for anyone who is looking to get a really strong foundation in these fields. I believe that taking AP Bio and AP Chem prior to taking Ls1a strongly helps make the class more understandable, but you need no real background, so it is possible to take without having taken those courses or an IB equivalent previously. However, LPSA may be more digestible if you didn't take AP Bio and AP Chem in high school. What I like best about this class is that it provides something for everyone, in terms of learning styles. The content is essentially taught three times: learning pods, lectures, and section. The best part is that learning pods provide both videos and textbook readings, which my friends and I are pretty evenly split between. Doing both is great, but usually just one will suffice. Personally, I only use chapters because I struggle to focus in lecture, and I learn pretty well from just reading and taking notes on these chapters. Section is really great for its small environment (~12 students each), which is additionally great for people who can't focus on lecture, and either way, it goes into much greater depth than lecture does which is super helpful for clarifying topics.Generally, I really think this is a great class to take. It is honestly not that difficult if you just put the time and effort in. The midterms and final are extremely fair, and the labs and problem sets aren't too time–consuming or overwhelmingly difficult, but rather help to solidify concepts. I do suggest finding a study group to check your work with, however, as it is easy to make small mistakes on homeworks, and checking has always helped me solidify the concepts in my own brain. Overall, as long as you put the time in, the class is very digestible.TLDR; take this class if you have already taken AP Chem and AP Bio, or if you just want a fuller foundation in these topics. There is something to fit everyone's learning style, and if you simply put in the time to learn in the way that works best for you, the class is very reasonable and super informative thanks to its excellently crafted and integrated curriculum. (Also, great for pre–meds and non–pre–meds. I'm not pre–med and I found this class super useful!)",
      "I highly recommend this course, but it will not necessarily be easy. I often found myself feeling absolutely confused; however, rather than give up, I reanalyzed my study habits/went to office hours/asked questions in section and would come to understand the material. Before taking this class, my biology background was so weak, but this class helped to fill those gaps.",

      "Ls1a is exactly what the title says ––– an integrated introduction to the life sciences. I think that Ls1a had an excellent curriculum, and masterfully blended chemistry and biology topics, which made each topic more digestible and understandable. I strongly encourage taking Ls1a for anyone who is looking to get a really strong foundation in these fields. I believe that taking AP Bio and AP Chem prior to taking Ls1a strongly helps make the class more understandable, but you need no real background, so it is possible to take without having taken those courses or an IB equivalent previously. However, LPSA may be more digestible if you didn't take AP Bio and AP Chem in high school. What I like best about this class is that it provides something for everyone, in terms of learning styles. The content is essentially taught three times: learning pods, lectures, and section. The best part is that learning pods provide both videos and textbook readings, which my friends and I are pretty evenly split between. Doing both is great, but usually just one will suffice. Personally, I only use chapters because I struggle to focus in lecture, and I learn pretty well from just reading and taking notes on these chapters. Section is really great for its small environment (~12 students each), which is additionally great for people who can't focus on lecture, and either way, it goes into much greater depth than lecture does which is super helpful for clarifying topics.Generally, I really think this is a great class to take. It is honestly not that difficult if you just put the time and effort in. The midterms and final are extremely fair, and the labs and problem sets aren't too time–consuming or overwhelmingly difficult, but rather help to solidify concepts. I do suggest finding a study group to check your work with, however, as it is easy to make small mistakes on homeworks, and checking has always helped me solidify the concepts in my own brain. Overall, as long as you put the time in, the class is very digestible.TLDR; take this class if you have already taken AP Chem and AP Bio, or if you just want a fuller foundation in these topics. There is something to fit everyone's learning style, and if you simply put in the time to learn in the way that works best for you, the class is very reasonable and super informative thanks to its excellently crafted and integrated curriculum. (Also, great for pre–meds and non–pre–meds. I'm not pre–med and I found this class super useful!)",
      "I highly recommend this course, but it will not necessarily be easy. I often found myself feeling absolutely confused; however, rather than give up, I reanalyzed my study habits/went to office hours/asked questions in section and would come to understand the material. Before taking this class, my biology background was so weak, but this class helped to fill those gaps.",

      "TL; DR – LS50 is (mostly) well–taught and the community is unparalleled, but you will struggle throughout the semester (for better and for worse).In order to succeed in this course, understanding Calc II material is crucial along with some Calc III familiarity; AP Chem and AP Bio (to a lesser extent) are also recommended! Like many have said in past q–reports, LS50 feels like 60% math, 40% everything else. As a non–math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I'll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability/stats – taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry – Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon – very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems – Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular/classical genetics – foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma/Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle – interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics/stat mech – while, in theory, it's interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression/dev bio – Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion/chemotaxis – kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.It's important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging. I think everyone ends up with an A, A–, or B+ however, this course is a profound time commitment. You will get very close with your classmates in Cabot until 4 AM some nights; you will walk away from office hours feeling like you learned how to approach a problem but must return the next day; you will simultaneous question your decision to do science and embrace the beauty of the material LS50 teaches. Overall, I recommend this course if you have a strong background but you have been warned (for better and for worse). You will meet some of your greatest friends freshman year and encounter significant challenges along the way.",
      "1) TAKE ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET. As soon as you start the class, go sign up for hours from ARC tutoring (if Jimena or Rae are still tutors for the class, sign up for their hours, they're the best!). Even if you don't need the help for the first couple of psets, you will absolutely start needing the help once the mathy concepts start kicking in. Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it's not mandatory but go anyway) because it's very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too – sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other! Basically my point here is that you will absolutely suffer in this class, but there is no medal for suffering and not knowing what's happening at all, so go get as many resources to help you as soon as possible.2) You will suffer in this class. There is no question. I don't know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it's a very hard class. You will also trauma bond with the other people in your class through the psets and exams. By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It's about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It's also not for people who don't want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. 4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night. I know we all liked to procrastinate in high school, but if you at all value your sleep in any way, don't leave things until Thursday night.5) The professors, TFs, and CAs truly truly care about you as people. They are so so understanding in terms of extensions and you can approach them with whatever you're concerned about in the course at all. They want to make sure that not only are you learning as a student but you are doing okay as a person. Overall I would highly highly recommend this class!",

Like many have said in past q–reports, LS50 feels like 60% math, 40% everything else. As a non–math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I'll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability/stats – taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry – Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon – very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems – Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular/classical genetics – foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma/Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle – interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics/stat mech – while, in theory, it's interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression/dev bio – Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion/chemotaxis – kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.It's important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging. I think everyone ends up with an A, A–, or B+ however, this course is a profound time commitment. You will get very close with your classmates in Cabot until 4 AM some nights; you will walk away from office hours feeling like you learned how to approach a problem but must return the next day; you will simultaneous question your decision to do science and embrace the beauty of the material LS50 teaches. Overall, I recommend this course if you have a strong background but you have been warned (for better and for worse). You will meet some of your greatest friends freshman year and encounter significant challenges along the way.",
      "1) TAKE ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET. As soon as you start the class, go sign up for hours from ARC tutoring (if Jimena or Rae are still tutors for the class, sign up for their hours, they're the best!). Even if you don't need the help for the first couple of psets, you will absolutely start needing the help once the mathy concepts start kicking in. Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it's not mandatory but go anyway) because it's very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too – sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other! Basically my point here is that you will absolutely suffer in this class, but there is no medal for suffering and not knowing what's happening at all, so go get as many resources to help you as soon as possible.2) You will suffer in this class. There is no question. I don't know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it's a very hard class. You will also trauma bond with the other people in your class through the psets and exams. By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It's about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It's also not for people who don't want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. 4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night. I know we all liked to procrastinate in high school, but if you at all value your sleep in any way, don't leave things until Thursday night.5) The professors, TFs, and CAs truly truly care about you as people. They are so so understanding in terms of extensions and you can approach them with whatever you're concerned about in the course at all. They want to make sure that not only are you learning as a student but you are doing okay as a person. Overall I would highly highly recommend this class!",

      "Lecture material:The strength of this course is the amount of incredibly interesting material that we learn. Every day in class and outside of class is a day of learning. I am usually not a fan of flip classroom styled classes, but this course has changed my mind. We have recorded materials that we need to watch before lectures, and they form the foundation for our discussion in our class. I think the pace of the class is food because every week, we move onto a different topic. Sometimes, they may be related but not always. I think having time during the weekend to watch the recorded videos is a perfect opportunity for me to pace myself of the foundation I need. If I learned the foundation in lecture, I would be so lost because of the amount of material covered in an hour. I am a bit slow, so it takes me about 2–3 hours to get through the weekly videos. The discussions in class are really helpful because we dissect experimental results, which helps us when we complete the psets and just think like a scientist. This class would NOT work if we learned the material in class and conducted a discussion in class. There would simply not be enough time. We learn so much during discussions, and it is really important that the slides are more clearly noted with what we have learned. At the beginning of the class, the course staff was like ‘oh, we cover a lot, sometime if you take notes than it will distract you and make you miss important details’ and I was like ok, that means post discussion slides would be detailed with notes, and that only proves to be true for some and not all of the discussion materials. Course staff:We have three different lecturers, Dominic, Vlad, and Emma. Each three of the lecturers vary differently in their discussion style. It's like getting whiplash every 3–4 weeks. Out of the three, my favorite are Dominic and Emma. Dominic is good at fostering discussion ground. Emma is the most clear to the point. Vlad is very verbose, beats around the bush half the time, slides are not clearly labeled. I had a great and knowledgable TF that made section less painless. All of the CAs have taken the class before, and they have a superb understanding of the course material and the stress that goes along with this class.Section:The section is 4 hours long because it includes going over lecture material and lab. I really enjoyed the lab components. It is indeed about 3–4 hours a week, but I had a great randomly assigned lab group and a wonderful TF. Psets:The psets are not that much of a time commitment. If you go to the right CA office hours, you can get all of it done within the single hour and then have some spare time on your own to polish the answers you submit. They highly revolve around experimental data, which I think is great for fostering critical thinking.Exams:I wish the exams covered also conceptual questions and basic knowledge rather than just dissecting experimental results. Dissecting the amount of experimental results that we do in an hour and 15 minutes of exam time is sometimes unreasonable and not practical. In the real world, you would have lot more time to come up with the conclusions that we were to ask to come up with in the exam room. Background:I am not an MCB concentrator. I have never taken ls1a and ls1b before. I did relatively fine in the class. I would say in the pond full of premeds that this class is, the class was a bit more stressful due to the students than the professors. Students seem to always be a bit competitive, and it might just be me, but a bit judgmental. I get some off–putting looks when I say something weird or incorrect in OH or in section, but I feel like that is what OH and section is for. Section TF and OH CAs are generally very good at slowing down the pace to help with understanding. It’s just that people who have a good on hold on the content are much louder than the people who are confused. People in the class are generally pretty cracked, but as an individual, I still need to iron out the confusion I have. There are numerous times where I were made to feel inferior, but I think that is the nature of a biology class, and you can’t take a biology class like this without having this many premeds in it. But don’t let this be your deciding factor of whether you take this class or not. I really enjoyed the class regardless of how I felt about the students.",
      "Be very careful. Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. I feel very snubbed by this courses way of handling its grades. RUN! If you are not concentrating in MCB or CPB, please don't do this course it could destroy your GPA that you've spent your freshmen or sophomore year building. I worked really hard to make up for a bad grade I got on my first exam and I felt like even after getting above average for the next to exams, I don't know if I even made the cut off for an A at least. I also feel like it was stressful to take this course with other ones. Really plan your semester if you're planning on taking this class. And remember that the exams are all that really matter in the end ( even if they weight just 10% they're what differentiate your grade from others. )",

      "This course was awesome! The content was so interesting and included (but was certainly not limited to) how the brain communicates, how the brain is organized, how the visual system works, how you perceive touch, how some neuroscience experiments are conducted, how learning might occur, and some interesting features of consciousness. I recommend this class to everyone; you will develop a much better appreciation of how complicated you are as a sapient being! Really try to take this class at some point during your four years here.In terms of workload, you will require a significant amount of diligence outside of class. Before each class, you have to watch 2–4 video lectures that are usually altogether an hour to an hour and half in total length. Individual videos range from about 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the total length of all the videos typically stays consistent. You are expected to know pretty much all of it on the tests and exams, so I recommend taking detailed notes. I would not just look at the slides or read the notes posted on Canvas; I found that I learned the content much better if I watched all the lecture videos. I would also try not to fall behind as it can be difficult to catch up since you will have new videos to watch. If you keep yourself honest and actually watch and take detailed notes on all the lectures, you will have a much better time preparing for the exams.The section quality depends on the TF. If you go to a certain TF the first week and do not think they are a good teacher, consider talking to your friends about their experiences and, if possible, switching to a section of someone who had a positive experience. Personally, I very much liked my TF (Alex Chen). He was an excellent explainer and fostered a chill, friendly environment in the classroom.Overall, this course is great! Take it, put in the effort, and you will not believe how much fascinating information you will learn in just one semester.",
      "This class is easy, kinda a flipped classroom style, but they also re go over video lectures in class again so it can be repetitive at times.",
      "Best class! Super interesting and pretty gem of a class. Tests and psets are very doable. It is flipped so the video lectures can be long, but they really help you learn the content, and you don't need to go to every in person class. Would recommend!"

      "This class is great!!! Yes, it is difficult, yes you may once or twice find yourself on the verge of tears at office hours, but it is totally worth it. The only thing to focus on is the psets, no bells or whistles, so it's super straightforward to know what you need to do each week. I would usually do a first pass of the assignment on Friday and work on it on the weekend, and then go to office hours on Monday to figure out where I was off, so Monday was usually the whole day spent on this, and then fix up a couple things Tuesday before submitting. The TFs are super helpful and friendly (Shoutout especially to Josh and Liana, they are the best!!!!!!) and they are committed to getting you to the finish line, so as much as there's difficulty, I never doubted that I could do it because they were so helpful during office hours. Also students are really collaborative explaining how to get started if you don't know how to start, so it's a great class to form a pset group.The psets are highly interesting!!!!!! The pset questions nicely fit together, so once you figure it out, it's super satisfying!!!!!!! Palpable sense of accomplishment every week. That's what made this course so interesting, learning so many new methods each week and analyzing data in a way that felt transferable to real life things. Highly recommend for AM–Bio and anyone who is up for a bit more of a challenge that will pay off. I also finally understood coding and feel much more confident creating my own functions / outlining bigger sections of code. Of course, now there's chatgpt to debug, but I think this course does a great job of taking elementary coding knowledge you might have from just like,,, being alive in the 21st century and giving you the training you need via pset scaffolding to make it useful. Def consider your overall courseload, but this is a must–take for AM–bio, Sean is a great, dedicated, and personable professor, and the TFs are gold. You will learn a lot, it's totally worth it!",
      "This course was extremely difficult for me as someone without much math or coding background. It is advertised as a class which is accessible to those without much background, but this is NOT true. The assignments will be extremely challenging, and the lectures will not explain concepts on a basic level, but will assume you already know stats. Some will say there is a large \"learning curve\" at first, and then it will get easier – this is not true because new statistics concepts get introduced every week. The lecture notes are confusing and very wordy and it is often hard to piece together what is actually expected for each assignment. The office hours are semi–helpful but if you do not  already have an understanding of math and coding, you cannot get the level of help you actually need.",

      "Overall, this class is a good class but not something unbelievably transformative. You will learn a lot about the molecular pathways that underlie the development of the brain in humans and in animals through reading research articles. The material is interesting, and Professor Kunes is very passionate. There are 4 pretty tough problem sets (1 every 2 weeks) that cover the material covered in lecture and help you actually learn it, which I found helpful. The challenge was that the TFs did very little to help you, even in office hours, so other students and I often had to beg the TFs for answers, which took some of the focus away from learning and simply added stress. The midterm and final project involved creating an experimental question, writing a grant–like proposal to tackle the experimental question, and then making a poster on your project and anticipated results from the study. If you pick something you are interested in and invest time into it, you should be fine. I especially enjoyed making the poster because it was a different type of assignment from many other classes. You should be able to do well this class and learn a lot if you put in work and effort throughout the semester. The biggest flaw with the class is that there were that there was far too much reading assigned and the lectures on the readings became boring at times. That said, I skipped a lot of the reading and I was fine, so don't worry if you don't have time to do it. The lecture slides are also posted with slide notes, so you can always look at those after as well to help you with the problem sets.",

The terminology is extremely hard to understand if you have no knowledge of immunology and are completely new to these molecules. However, it does get better during the semester and you will get used to it. There is an absurd amount of memorization of specific molecules and process as well. You will have to learn a lot and be very self–motivated because there is barely any work but you need to take the initiative to go over lectures and reading the textbook or watching HMX videos.

You will likely find some topics more interesting than others, but I thought that was a real strength of the course –– it provides a nice survey of what current research in biophysics looks like, and for me personally, was a great chance to find what areas excited me most. Final assignment is a good exercise in asking interesting questions –– did take some effort to do, but I found it rewarding. Good class, recommend it!",
      "For any future students, let me tell you, MCB 294 is just plain disappointing. It is probably the most underwhelming class I’ve had in my whole time at Harvard as a student. On paper, it sounded cool – each week you get a different professor to introduce their research, but in reality, it was a hot mess from start to finish.First off, the professor barely even showed up. Professor Nancy Kleckner? She was MIA for like 90% of the class. She only popped in for the first day, one random lecture, and then one “check–in” session. After that, it was all on the Teaching Fellow (TF)—who honestly wasn’t much help either. She barely tried to connect with us, mostly just sat in the corner on her laptop like she had better things to do. Nobody tried to build any type of community, and it left everyone feeling lost and disconnected. Oh, and the room setup was confusing too. Half of my classmates were stuck sitting on the side against the wall, while the rest of us got to be in the action at a central table. However, this led to my peers that sat on the outside feeling left out of discussions, and a strong sense of disconnect.When it came to assignments, you only had two things all semester: a three–page paper and a 10–minute presentation. However, don’t expect much help on that. The only support we got was a one–on–one Zoom with Nancy to “brainstorm” ideas for the paper and a group feedback session—but that was not enough. There was no rubric, no clear guidance, nothing. Then, Nancy's feedback? It was mostly negative and confusing, leaving everyone frustrated and feeling like they had no direction. While her comments were valid at times, it just came off extremely condescending, and did not motivate us to do better.Then things just kept getting worse. During one of the feedback sessions, the TF accidentally screen shared an email from Nancy about a student’s final project in front of the whole class, which was straight up embarrassing. But that wasn’t even the worst part. When it came time for the final presentations, Nancy didn’t even bother to show up. For the big event that was supposed to wrap up everything, she straight up ghosted our class due to having a conference abroad. To be honest, most of us wished that Nancy could've either rescheduled for a day that she could attend, or at least chosen to be there remotely, instead of completely leaving us behind. Then, to make matters worse, one of the backup professors who was supposed to give feedback came late. According to my friends in that later section, the professor didn’t even show up for the first hour of the presentations, meaning a bunch of them got no feedback at all. Long story short, this class was a straight–up mess. No structure, no support, and no real engagement from the staff. Yeah, there’s not much work to do each week, but that’s only because the class had no true direction. This experience honestly left me questioning my whole grad school experience, and I’d say avoid this class at all costs. There are way better options out there if you actually want to learn something.",

I've found some of my best friends in choir, and it's just so encouraging to see vastly different people connect through music. It's a great opportunity to really think about learning better tempo, sight–reading, vocal resonance, singing techniques, while also preparing concerts where you get to highlight all this work. I got to perform with the Boston Philarmonic Orchestra, the Yale Glee Club, the Havard–Radcliffe Orchestra, and on our own in Sanders! Next semester we're even singing for a commissioned opera (which is crazy). I really enjoyed this class and shoutout to the best conductor Dr. Cai and accompanist Justin. Please audition for choir (specifically RCS)! You won't regret it!",

Combining both tactile playing experience on the viol with historical learning through lectures, there's hardly a course at Harvard quite the same.

Expect to get out of the class what you put in! Assignments were very thought–provoking and utilized the knowledge we learned in class, both historical and tactile. I especially appreciated the options for Assignments #2 & 3; as a non–string player, the ability to choose between writing a piece or playing one reassured me that I could still showcase my strengths and understanding of the material in the way I felt most comfortable.

For example I really wanted to speak up and ask important questions about assignments and expectations, but because there was so much room and time to talk every class about popular music artists or what songs/artists were afrofuturist, it was hard to get to those questions. So take an active role in asking a lot of questions about what really matters to steer the class conversation,  which is what level of musical analysis is expected and, as an important follow–up, ask for great student examples of that from her so you don’t feel lost on her standards for musical and contextual analysis.",

I was so impressed by how Dana made the class fun, interesting, and useful for everyone in it. If you have no experience, you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the letters and sounds, but there is SO much in class practice that you can do it. There are also lovely gatherings and outings during which you can practice your Arabic and any level of interaction is encouraged at those events. I had an amazing time in this class and it brought me a lot closer to my Arabic–speaking family; I can’t recommend it more!

      "This class is a huge commitment of time and effort, but it is the front facing academic adventure at Harvard for me. Although meeting four times a week can be a little frustrating at times, that is four times a week I've learned something new. I think this class is very enriching – linguistically and for academics overall. They're fair in their grading, they encourage you to engage with the language and culture more via numerous extra credit opportunities. If you're looking for something easy, it's best to choose another class. But if you're here to engage and really challenge yourself, this is one of the classes at Harvard you should take.",

Despite the small size, the class is mostly a lecture (with room to ask questions/go back and forth with Prof Harris), and it was a really good lecture every week. Professor Harris explains complicated historical and philosophical topics extremely clearly; I found his lectures easy to follow and engaging, and I learned a tremendous amount. While the class is primarily about philosophy and religious thought, Harris contextualizes the authors we read very thoroughly in class. As a result, it’s also a class about Jewish history and German history (and, to a lesser extent, French and Eastern European history), and I learned a lot about those topics as well.",

      "An amazing class, taught by none other than Prof. Mojtaba Ebrahimian, an excellent and incredibly kind teacher. I went into this course with prior knowledge of the script and elementary Persian vocab/terms, so this class took roughly 2 hours out of my typical work–week. I assume it would be a steep learning curve and relatively fast–paced at the beginning of the semester (approx. 6–10 hours a week) for complete beginners to Persian, but Prof. Ebrahimian did an excellent job engaging with students through pop culture references, interesting personal anecdotes to augment our lessons, and constantly reviewing and reinforcing key concepts in class with patience and encouragement.  This course, according to Prof. Ebrahimian, goes at roughly twice the pace of a typical American college curriculum for introductory Persian, but don't be discouraged; it is structured incredibly well and graded very fairly.  You will be surrounded by students from all backgrounds and stages of education––from scholars at the Divinity School to undecided freshmen and physics PhD candidates––and you will emerge at the end of the semester with an eagerness and preparedness to continue studying Persian, as well as a far deeper appreciation for Persianate studies. Prof. Ebrahimian is such an experienced and talented instructor, and it's a shame that Harvard treats its preceptors so disrespectfully––he was very well–liked and respected among all students in the class, but Harvard administrators abruptly terminated his contract for flimsy reasons (yes, Harvard's preceptor contracts basically allow at–will termination after their third year) and he had no other choice than to find a different job which resulted in him leaving in the middle of the semester. A substitute preceptor, Masoud Ariankhoo, took over from November until the end of the semester, and like Prof. Ebrahimian, he was an incredible language instructor with deeply insightful methods for language acquisition and an unmatched patience for our class, especially given the unfortunate and chaotic circumstances surrounding his rushed employment and the responsibilities he had to shoulder. To future readers of this QGuide, I can guarantee that your preceptor will be an amazing instructor who, like Profs. Ebrahimian and Ariankhoo, will stir your love for this beautiful language and more than adequately prepare you for future studies in Persian. I only hope that Harvard will treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve. I enrolled in this class in my very last semester as a college student because I had promised myself I would take full advantage of the exploratory opportunities offered by a liberal arts education, and I had wanted to study Persian since high school but never found the time to actually take it until the very last moment. This was by far the most enjoyable class I took this semester; I am so, so lucky I made the right decision of taking it.",

Outside of class, Hocam is super understanding and supportive. Her Canvas feedback is always very pointed and instructive, and she is always available to meet to discuss any class concepts at office hours. If you don't have a prior background in Turkic languages, Turkish might seem really difficult at first. For me, I know I definitely experienced a learning curve the first few weeks when I was still getting a basic feeling for the grammatical structure and sound of the language. Don't worry, it'll all start to click as the class progresses, and Meryem Hocam is always there to help!

The content was so interesting and included (but was certainly not limited to) how the brain communicates, how the brain is organized, how the visual system works, how you perceive touch, how some neuroscience experiments are conducted, how learning might occur, and some interesting features of consciousness. I recommend this class to everyone; you will develop a much better appreciation of how complicated you are as a sapient being! Really try to take this class at some point during your four years here.In terms of workload, you will require a significant amount of diligence outside of class. Before each class, you have to watch 2–4 video lectures that are usually altogether an hour to an hour and half in total length. Individual videos range from about 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the total length of all the videos typically stays consistent. You are expected to know pretty much all of it on the tests and exams, so I recommend taking detailed notes. I would not just look at the slides or read the notes posted on Canvas; I found that I learned the content much better if I watched all the lecture videos. I would also try not to fall behind as it can be difficult to catch up since you will have new videos to watch. If you keep yourself honest and actually watch and take detailed notes on all the lectures, you will have a much better time preparing for the exams.The section quality depends on the TF. If you go to a certain TF the first week and do not think they are a good teacher, consider talking to your friends about their experiences and, if possible, switching to a section of someone who had a positive experience. Personally, I very much liked my TF (Alex Chen). He was an excellent explainer and fostered a chill, friendly environment in the classroom.Overall, this course is great! Take it, put in the effort, and you will not believe how much fascinating information you will learn in just one semester.",

      "Best class! Super interesting and pretty gem of a class. Tests and psets are very doable. It is flipped so the video lectures can be long, but they really help you learn the content, and you don't need to go to every in person class. Would recommend!"

      "Overall, this class is a good class but not something unbelievably transformative. You will learn a lot about the molecular pathways that underlie the development of the brain in humans and in animals through reading research articles. The material is interesting, and Professor Kunes is very passionate. There are 4 pretty tough problem sets (1 every 2 weeks) that cover the material covered in lecture and help you actually learn it, which I found helpful. The challenge was that the TFs did very little to help you, even in office hours, so other students and I often had to beg the TFs for answers, which took some of the focus away from learning and simply added stress. The midterm and final project involved creating an experimental question, writing a grant–like proposal to tackle the experimental question, and then making a poster on your project and anticipated results from the study. If you pick something you are interested in and invest time into it, you should be fine. I especially enjoyed making the poster because it was a different type of assignment from many other classes. You should be able to do well this class and learn a lot if you put in work and effort throughout the semester. The biggest flaw with the class is that there were that there was far too much reading assigned and the lectures on the readings became boring at times. That said, I skipped a lot of the reading and I was fine, so don't worry if you don't have time to do it. The lecture slides are also posted with slide notes, so you can always look at those after as well to help you with the problem sets.",

      "Take this class! This course is a clear example of one that teaches you more than just the material, but ways to think about the material going forward. As regeneration and regrowth is such a new field, it feels essential to not only master previous literature but also ways to explore and expand going forward. The final project is a little bit daunting and expectations aren't very clear from the beginning, but the staff is receptive to feedback. Prof. Macklis can be a bit sassy and self–referential, but he means well and has a vast amount of expertise in research and medical fields. Everything is super interesting, just take good notes!",
      "In the most respectful way possible, this course was hands–down the worst upper–level course I have taken at Harvard. To begin, the syllabus seemingly implies structured lectures, but they were the complete opposite. Macklis unfortunately cannot go on for more than 5–10 minutes without going on an incoherent tangent that never pertains to the material at hand, despite stating he always knows how to get back on track. So much so, that we are often 3–4 lectures behind schedule on the syllabus. When points of confusion arise and you ask a question, he goes on another tangent or rudely cuts you off and never fully answers the question if at all. Everything taught in this class is covered by the developmental unit in NEURO80, so each lecture often feels like a waste of time. Coupled with Macklis' pompous and exceedingly arrogant attitude, this is easily one of the worst classes I have taken. Assignments, \"midterms\", and the final project are relatively straightforward but can feel repetitive and like busy work. Each lecture's readings are unreasonable and unnecessary (many of which are the professor's own work or collaborations), as Macklis rarely touches upon them or discusses their contents. The only \"bright–side\" of this course are: it being over and the sections where you review and learn about new experimental techniques or about revolutionary developmental biology with the TFs.  Save yourself the time, frustration, and boredom and skip this course if it is still available.",

I also took it with very hard classes which I’m begging you not to do. The lab practicals are ok, the exams are long. 17 pages in one hour one time. There’s no multiple questions and the questions are VERY PARTICULAR. Your whole term will be dependent on this class. There’s no psets but do not be fooled by that. The content is taught in a chaotic order and often time it’s very frustrating. The amount of information you need to learn and reproduce down to every detail is insane. All I can say is be aware and good luck.",

All the professors are very evidently passionate about their field of research and teaching LS2, which makes the class a really enjoyable experience. HOWEVER I will caveat by saying that this was also undeniably the hardest class I have taken. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. The sheer amount of memorization and level of detail you need to know for the exams (which are all recall–based) and the 2 midterm/3 lab practical structure means that it feels like you are studying for an exam in this class every other week. If that doesn't deter you though, it is such a great class. Also try and get Joel's lab sections if you can!! He is a GEM of a lab TF and also truly cares about his students."

      "buckle upppp. this course is super interesting and the professors are great! talk to them and ask them questions, go to office hours and ask your TFs questions, ask Jo questions–– just use the people around you as resources. study consistently as well; it's easy to put off studying since this class has no weekly assignments like p–sets, but your future exam near the exam date will thank you and hug you and kiss you, so do yourself a favor and study along the way. even if its just learning and locking in the diagrams you learn in lecture or rereading slides or taking HANDWRITTEN NOTES during class, study along the way. overall, enjoy the class! it's cool and fun to learn how your body works and get to know the staff as well, they're super sweet and supportive and cool. TLDR: LS2 almost ruined me but i would definitely recommend!",

The workload is alright, somewhat time–consuming but nothing crazy. Classes are super interesting, the teaching team is approachable and helpful, Professor Davies is great, and also really (partially unintentionally) funny. Exams can be slightly challenging as it is different from any other class I have taken where they don't ask you the exact information from the class, but rather give you cases to interpret with the information you have. Overall, amazing class, totally take it if you can!",

This course's approach to conservation biology is overly broad and doesn't focus on any aspects of conservation enough. Also, exams in this course just don't make sense. Most class content focuses on prompting students to think about conservation efforts, not memorize terms or concepts. Another thing is most teaching staff were not friendly. I would recommend taking OEB 10 or 55 for an alternative.",

      "This is an excellent class if you are interested in gaining familiarity with the mathematical language of evolutionary biology (i.e., theoretical population genetics). It is not a replacement for OEB 242, and I would probably recommend taking 242 before this one (although I didn't, and I did fine). Having comfort with basic probability theory (at the level of Stat 110) is essential to get anything useful out of the class; familiarity with stochastic processes (Stat 171) would have been helpful for the second half of the course, although I didn't have it. Problem sets/assignments are fairly straightforward; you can usually finish them in section. The final project is an interesting original research question in which you use msprime to simulate some coalescent scenario, and can be a lot of fun if you start early. For undergrads: this is a grad class, which means that the purpose of problem sets is not to punish you for not properly learning the material – you can skate by without learning very much, so it's incumbent on you to read the book and ruminate on the lecture material outside of the class. You won't get very much out of the class if you don't.",

      "This class is a very unintimidating introduction to Harvard's philosophy department, and I would recommend to anyone considering a philosophy concentration or secondary. I personally took the class for my Arts and Humanities distribution requirement and am not really interested in philosophy, but this course was still a great experience.I'm not sure how relevant this feedback will be for next year's iteration if Mariana isn't teaching again, so make sure you check who the instructor is.The week–to–week workload in this class is very light; most weeks you will just have 20–40 pages of reading to do and answer a Canvas discussion post for completion. You must also attend lecture twice a week and weekly section for your attendance grade; you are allowed to miss two lectures and two sections without penalty.In this class, your grade is mostly based on your essays. You will write 3 essays throughout the semester, each one introduced at the start of the month (October, November, December) and due about 2 weeks later. The first essay is 2 pages and only for practice and feedback, so it doesn't count for a grade. The other two essays are the same format and 4 pages long and graded very leniently with a lot of time to talk with your TF on how to improve it before submitting. This means that your first letter–graded assessment isn't due until mid–November. However, I wouldn't really worry about your grade too much; go to office hours when there's an essay due and you'll do fine, an A should be pretty easy to achieve.There's also an exit interview during reading period/finals; it's very casual and should only take about 20 minutes and is really just a discussion between you, two other students, and Mariana. Don't worry too much about this, just come prepared to talk about some topics in philosophy (she gives you all the questions beforehand), and it is graded leniently as well.Lectures in this class are sometimes interesting, but I also found that they could drag on when people kept asking questions, a lot of the time being unrelated to course material (e.g. asking how Heidigger would view a certain topic that we're discussing?). However, this could just be due to my lack of interest in philosophy, so if you are truly interested in the topics then lecture should be fine.Sections in this class are a great way to discuss that week's topics with your TF and fellow students. If you're confused about a certain concept from that week, section is a good place to ask for clarification. Section also helps you with essay planning and writing strategies after essays are assigned. The TFs in this class are great and very knowledgeable; don't be afraid to go to their office hours throughout the week (or Mariana's); they're all happy to answer any questions you may have and are very flexible, so if you can't make their office hours they may be able to schedule an appointment with you. Many students didn't use this resource and struggled because of that.Overall, if you think you might be interested in philosophy, this is a great way to introduce yourself to the department and learn how to write about philosophy. If you want a light elective or just to fulfill the Arts and Humanities distribution requirement, this would also be a good class, but make sure you explore all of your options to see if a different class would interest you more and be more fulfilling.",
      "This class is not a great intro class for philosophy. Professor Noe tries to teach so many school of thoughts in this class and this classroom discussions were really awful. Almost 30–45 minutes of the time went on two to four people who have taken philosophy classes arguing against each other. It's an easy class but not intellectually rewarding due to the way it's taught.",
      "Phil 7 is a fantastic introduction to ancient Greek and Roman philosophy for someone who might be potentially interested in exploring the field. If you are on the edge about taking this course, I would highly recommend you go for it. Dr. Noe is one of the most passionate and kind professors I have ever met. While something like ancient philosophy might sound not that interesting to many, she does an amazing job of making the lectures engaging and entertaining. Also, this course is mostly what you make out of it. You could very well skim the readings, show up to lecture and fully dissociate, and start your essays one day before they are due, but you won't be making the best out of this gem of a course that way. The 4–page essays might feel like a challenge especially if you're a stem concentrator, but again, Dr. Noe goes above and beyond in making sure you have the right assistance at all times."

There were many essay opportunities of which we only had to do 4 (or 5 to replace a grade), and there was a lot of choice in the prompts.  Office hours were acceptable, but most assignments were reading based. Homework involved reading or listening to science podcasts, which were fun to listen to. Midterm was fair, MC and some short essay questions that were graded pretty quickly. The professor makes missing class for illness pretty accessible, posting videos and lecture notes. Cons; It is at 9 AM, essay questions on midterms are handwritten only, and your grade is almost entirely based on the midterm and final.** TLDR ; Fantastic course, would recommend if you enjoy philosophy/the physical sciences",
      "This course is an introduction. It covers a variety of interesting topics in the philosophy of science, but it covers nothing in depth. It helped me organize my thoughts about science, which I found fruitful, but if you're looking for a course that talks about, say, scientific models for a few lectures and reads technical philosophical papers and asks you to write critical philosophy papers on them, this course won't do that.",
      "amazing course and amazing content and amazing lecturer! only reservation with this course was the grading style –– assignments seemed low–stakes but realistically the grading this semester was a little unstandardized and stressful to navigate (though the TA was sweet and did her best, it was still a bit part of my grievances with the course). hopefully it's rectified in the future as the course actually teaches some very useful concepts and really opened my eyes towards philosophy of science. would encourage anyone going into science/research or even with a vague interest in it to try, but be careful –– this is far from a gem."

Professor Matherne gives very engaging lectures, and I often left awestruck and with a new view on life. This class seriously did change the way I see the world.Assignments wise, the readings were pretty manageable week over week and the three phil–aesthetic assignments were fun and pretty easy to do, and they were essentially completion based. In typical philosophy fashion, there's no easy As on the midterm papers, so you might consider going Pass/Fail if this is an elective for you to not stress about small differences in grades.

      "I strongly discourage any students from taking this course until it is overhauled because of the course's inexcusable disorganization that severely impeded students' learning. I would have dropped this course after the first two lectures because they were an evident foreshadowing of what the rest of the semester would hold, but I was bound to take this course to finish my degree requirements. There was no sense of organization or consistency between weeks, and the syllabus was only finalized in the final weeks of the course. The schedule was regularly shifted, moving deadlines and assigned readings between weeks, and these shifts would happen without notice and occasionally without any communication. The course canvas page was a nightmare to navigate, and the course assignments were very loosely defined. I would say this course had a light to moderate workload, but I have no inclination as to how I even performed––I may receive an A or I may fail, but I will only find out when semester grades are released. I never once received feedback on any of my assignments, leaving me oblivious as to whether I was on track or properly understanding the material. Lastly, I do not have confidence in the course's pedagogy. It was emphasized multiple times in the course that the field is very difficult to break into. Indian philosophy carries with it an entire worldview distinct from the Western perspective we live in. Nevertheless, while this may be true to a degree, this comment seemed to be used as a crutch to excuse the course's lack of organization and holistic insight into the field. Other universities are capable of building comprehensive introductory courses that cover the major thinkers and schools of thought within Indian philosophy, but this was proclaimed as an impossibility, so this class focused more on emphasizing the nuances within Indian Philosophy than on providing its students with an intuition about its history and development (despite being a \"History of Philosophy\" course). After taking this course, I have no sense of the progression of thought in all of India's history (I would give a range of years of the philosophers we read, but I was never even told when they lived; 2000 AD is as good of a guess as 2000 BC). I also have no understanding of how the different schools of Indian philosophy relate to each other socially, politically, or even philosophically, much less how Indian Philosophy has interacted with the rest of the world.Nonetheless, other schools seem to be capable of teaching Indian Philosophy with a comprehensive view of the progression of thought while still emphasizing how it is distinct from Western philosophy. The difference is that these schools kept trying, whereas Harvard decided to give up on achieving anything holistic, leaving its students dazed and confused.",

There are a decent number of assignments (weekly question posts, 1 in–class presentation, 2 short papers/paper idea sketches, and a longer final paper), but Professor Johnson King is a very reasonable grader and spaces the assignments out over the course of the semester, so it does not feel like too much. Professor Johnson King is extremely knowledgeable about ethics and moral psychology, and she is also quite approachable and very willing to make herself available to students in office hours. She has a great sense of humor and does a good job of making class discussion engaging without sacrificing philosophical rigor or depth. I highly recommend this class, especially if you are interested in ethics, value theory, or praise in general.",

It is academically challenging because it involves multivariable calculus, but I think Louis attempts to make it as painless as possible. Grade–wise, sure you might not be getting the A that you wanted, but I think at the end of the day it’s about the learning. If you are premed, maybe don’t take about this class cuz it might drop your GPA, but I really think that if you want a good foundational understanding of E&M, this is a truly good class. There is a reason why most of the students in this class are not premeds and are more likely to be physics/engineering students All of the students are on the best no–gatekeeping policy I know of. We truly help each other out, and I cannot ask for a better learning environment. As to what makes this class great:Louis – an outstanding lecturer, this is his first time he is teaching the class, so there was obvious some kinks here and there, but overall he really dumbs it down for basic understanding but then keeps all of the important details that needed to be understood there. He slows down some of the lecture material in order to ensure that no student is left behind. He posts really detailed lecture notes afterwards because the derivations can get cumbersome in class so he encourages to look at them after class to understand the steps that we took in class.Aurelian – the TF I had, the best TF I have ever had at Harvard hands down (I’m a junior). A huge reason why I am no longer scared of this subject. (I was really apprehensive because of my previous physics class experience) He comes to section very well prepared. He goes over the lecture material and really dissects how we should approach a physics problem (e.g. step 1, 2, 3, …) He breaks down misconceptions very well. I cannot sing enough praises for his teaching style. He lets us go off on our own for the first 5–7 minutes to attempt it on our own and goes around the classroom helping us out. This is also a perfect time to ask any lingering questions about the concept or the section problem. Then after those 5–7 minutes, he regroups the class and goes through problem, stopping to make sure we understanding the material, answering any questions we have, really encourages active participation and engagement. Other teaching staff – The amount of teaching support this class is super great. There is office hours basically every day. Shout out to Daria, Deb, Mary, Linda, Stefan, Rares, Aurelian, Louis for making this possible. Everyone was super devoted to helping students understand the course material. No question is a bad question. They prefer for you to ask your questions and settle misconceptions once and for all instead of letting these misconceptions fester. The psets are not super long, but they definitely require time, so don’t leave them until physics night. I always get mine started over the weekend.Lab – confusing instructions at times, but you can get a lot more practical understanding of the concepts we learn in class in lab.

      "This class is a wonderful introduction E&M class. It is so so so so so fantastic. Comparing this with the apphy, ps, ps12 series, I think you will do the most learning with this 15b class. It is academically challenging because it involves multivariable calculus, but I think Louis attempts to make it as painless as possible. Grade–wise, sure you might not be getting the A that you wanted, but I think at the end of the day it’s about the learning. If you are premed, maybe don’t take about this class cuz it might drop your GPA, but I really think that if you want a good foundational understanding of E&M, this is a truly good class. There is a reason why most of the students in this class are not premeds and are more likely to be physics/engineering students All of the students are on the best no–gatekeeping policy I know of. We truly help each other out, and I cannot ask for a better learning environment. As to what makes this class great:Louis – an outstanding lecturer, this is his first time he is teaching the class, so there was obvious some kinks here and there, but overall he really dumbs it down for basic understanding but then keeps all of the important details that needed to be understood there. He slows down some of the lecture material in order to ensure that no student is left behind. He posts really detailed lecture notes afterwards because the derivations can get cumbersome in class so he encourages to look at them after class to understand the steps that we took in class.Aurelian – the TF I had, the best TF I have ever had at Harvard hands down (I’m a junior). A huge reason why I am no longer scared of this subject. (I was really apprehensive because of my previous physics class experience) He comes to section very well prepared. He goes over the lecture material and really dissects how we should approach a physics problem (e.g. step 1, 2, 3, …) He breaks down misconceptions very well. I cannot sing enough praises for his teaching style. He lets us go off on our own for the first 5–7 minutes to attempt it on our own and goes around the classroom helping us out. This is also a perfect time to ask any lingering questions about the concept or the section problem. Then after those 5–7 minutes, he regroups the class and goes through problem, stopping to make sure we understanding the material, answering any questions we have, really encourages active participation and engagement. Other teaching staff – The amount of teaching support this class is super great. There is office hours basically every day. Shout out to Daria, Deb, Mary, Linda, Stefan, Rares, Aurelian, Louis for making this possible. Everyone was super devoted to helping students understand the course material. No question is a bad question. They prefer for you to ask your questions and settle misconceptions once and for all instead of letting these misconceptions fester. The psets are not super long, but they definitely require time, so don’t leave them until physics night. I always get mine started over the weekend.Lab – confusing instructions at times, but you can get a lot more practical understanding of the concepts we learn in class in lab. It’s two hours each week, so not too bad.",

      "Great class! Definitely more difficult than I was expecting, though. The exams were not hard in the normal sense, more just challenging because they were weird, at least compared to other physics classes. It was hard to get partial credit on several problems, and the topics seemed a bit niche. The exam reviews were super helpful in highlighting what would be important, though. Also, there were no practice materials for the exams, which made it even harder to know what to expect. I would not say the exams were unfair, but they were hard to prepare for in a way that maybe could have been fixed. It is possible that future iterations of the course, if taught by Morii, will have better materials because they will have exams from this year to use. P–sets were also a bit weird and sometimes a little niche, but they were not as grueling as I have found for other physics classes, and office hours were extremely helpful. Lectures were effective, if occasionally moving a little fast, and the lecture notes provided were pretty thorough. Labs were definitely a substantial time commitment, but I found them to be far more enjoyable than in previous 15–series classes. The teaching staff cares a lot, which really made a difference. I came into this class with no particular affinity for physics (chem student) and walked out with a much greater appreciation for physics and a chem/phys concentration.",

      "Great class! Tons of support available at Help Room if something isn't clicking. Lectures sometimes move a little fast, but the notebooks you work out of are usually detailed enough that you can follow along if you look back at the completed version later. If things feel a little simple early on––don't worry, it ramps up. The last third or so of the course was definitely a lot of information and some difficult problem–solving, but still manageable, especially with help. Homeworks sometimes took a deceptively long time, but again, still doable. No in–person exams, and the take–homes were essentially just longer P–Sets with no Help Room.

      "Great class! Tons of support available at Help Room if something isn't clicking. Lectures sometimes move a little fast, but the notebooks you work out of are usually detailed enough that you can follow along if you look back at the completed version later. If things feel a little simple early on––don't worry, it ramps up. The last third or so of the course was definitely a lot of information and some difficult problem–solving, but still manageable, especially with help. Homeworks sometimes took a deceptively long time, but again, still doable. No in–person exams, and the take–homes were essentially just longer P–Sets with no Help Room. Overall, a great class to take if you have no or very little coding background and just want to learn enough to be able to apply it to other fields.",

      "THIS IS A GREAT COURSE. Professor Samuel is such an amazing human being and very smart. It was interesting to hear him ask insightful questions during talks. The course format involves meeting twice a week: visiting a research lab on Mondays, usually in LISE, Lyman, Jefferson, Northwest, or sometimes Mallinckrodt, and attending a talk on Tuesdays. There is free dinner in Lyman before the talk with the professor, where they discuss their research and career journey, and it has always been fun attending the dinners. Besides attendance, we had to write three response papers. These papers are about what piqued our interest from the talks and research lab visits. Writing the response papers might seem intimidating at first, but it is actually not bad and can be interesting if you ask the right question. There was also a final presentation at the end about one of the response papers. It was not a lot of work, just a brief 10–minute summary of the response paper.Professor Samuel and Armaan have been amazing, and they are so nice and understanding. You will also learn a lot about the research happening in Harvard labs from the visits and talks.",

      "This class is amazing! You will learn so much about so many incredibly useful and interesting topics and your physical understanding and problem solving skills will really improve. Other courses usually just have one huge topic and as soon as you stop following in a week you are cooked for the rest of the class. Since you basically do a new topic every week it does not hurt too much if you do not understand something (as long as you catch up with it for exams later on) so it is a great course to balance some other classes. It really fuelled my enthusiasm for physics again that I thought I lost at college and it is great fun. Above all, however, Prof Morin is simply amazing as everyone can tell who ever took a class with him. He is so incredibly structured and really cares about your experience in the class (he also did further readings if we asked silly questions that he could not answer in lecture and sent us follow up emails with further nerdy knowledge). And if you get Anmol as your TF then this class gets even more amazing because he is phenomenal! Take it, take it, take it!!!",

      "OMG I LOVED THIS CLASS. Quantum mechanics is such a cool topic and I'm so glad I decided to skip 15c and take it. I was worried because Cora tells everyone in the beginning \"I'm gonna assume you all took 15b and 15c\" but to be honest, you're totally fine without 15c. Besides, quantum teaches you all the stuff that's actually relevant moving on from 15c without you having to go through the 15c growing pains. It's awesome because taking 143a will open a lot of gates for you: you have more options for physics courses or research labs to join. It's a great pill to swallow. I personally am not a fan of the psets. They felt very computational to the point that I was questioning if I'm taking QM or Math 1a. It's literally pages and pages of stupid Gaussian integrals where you have to integrate by parts like 3 times for one integral. And there's like at least 12 integrals to evaluate on most of the early psets. I think I would've done better if the psets were conceptually challenging and tested my understanding of the material instead of my ability to compute integrals. But that's more of a problem with the book that the problems are sourced from, I suppose. Speaking of the book, Griffith's book is great (a pretty standard textbook) and it was pretty clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend reading the book because it's very easy to follow along the derivations, get lost in the math, and forget about what you're doing at a conceptual level. In terms of pre–reqs, DEFINITELY TAKE LINEAR ALGEBRA BEFORE. You absolutely MUST understand how to diagonalize matrices, the concept behind eigenvalues, vector spaces, etc. Knowing Fourier Analysis helps too. I found my knowledge from 21b transferred beautifully. Thinking of constructing eigenbases, understanding the spectral theorem, etc can help you establish a stronger understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Of course if you want an even more rigorous introduction to QM you could take 251. But the point of this course is to provide you the basic tools to start doing real physics. There are likely freshman who want to skip 15b, 15c and take this course. I think you could totally do that as long as you have taken 21b/22a. If you've taken Physics 19, you'll find that some things are familiar. If you have zero experience with linear algebra, definitely do not take it. It's impossible to take this course without linear algebra–– you would either have to crash course it or you would be memorizing formulas without really understanding.I loved this course so much and it has definitely made me hungry to learn more physics!!",
      "READ THE TEXTBOOK! And if its been a while since you've taken Linear Algebra, then refer to the textbook's appendix, which makes for a very helpful refresher on the necessary concepts. I simply did not find the lectures sufficient to learn the material, and, in all honesty, I learned most of the material from reading.For the engineers out there thinking that it would be cool and quirky to study quantum mechanics, be very wary of the work that it takes. It is just as difficult as its reputation purports and in the end, you will end up with very niche knowledge about a topic that will have almost no practical application. That said, if quantum subfields of electronics or particle accelerators are your thing, then go for it, but as a mechanical engineer, I unfortunately never see myself using this information except for the intuition it gave me for real–world applications of linear algebra.",

      "Okay, first the pessimistic side of things: Physics 143b is hard. Not for everyone in this class, many people seem to be chilling, but from someone who is generally maybe not the brightest physicist let me tell you that for us normal kids it is really hard. HOWEVER, it is doable. I never went to office hours before taking this class, which I definitely had to change. And you certainly need to put some hours in, but no one fails and people care for you, especially Prof Mitrano. And now to the optimistic side of things: Prof Mitrano is A–MA–ZING!!! He cares so incredibly much about this class, he encourages participation so well and above all his humor is so sharp and great that it is a pleasure going to class. He creates a great sense of community (the fact that it's hard also plays into that community–building aspect) and I got my graded exams back three hours (!) after I put down my pen. He also really cares about how things are going with this class, so if something is going harder than you think it should go you can and should definitely tell him right away. And for the academic side of things: I only understood how little I had understood from 143a and quantum physics after taking 143b. There is a reason why the courses have the same number, not necessarily because the topics overlap a lot but because you won't get any understanding of quantum with just taking 143a. I would say I only understood like 70 % of this class but at least now I understand everything from 143a and trust me I did not understand anything coming out of that course. So take this class. If you want to go to grad school or not, it is worth it. I will probably not go any higher level for now but it was definitely a really rewarding experience and trust me: If I could do it, you can do it for sure! :)",

      "Physics 151 has its ups and downs. Professor Jaffe is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the course topics. However, since he has been teaching it for so long, he covers some topics too quickly for full digestion. Reviewing his notes and going to section/office hours can help with this. Professor Jaffe loves it when students ask questions, so it would be wise to review enough content between classes so that you can have questions to ask. The topics covered in this class truly are interesting, but they are sometimes difficult to grasp what they physically mean due to the (what feels like) rapid pace that they are covered. However, this seems to be a good way to learn about theoretical physics. I would say pre–reqs for this class are multivariable calculus and a standard linear algebra course. Some exposure to differential equations is helpful, but only basic diffeqs come up (at least you only need to solve basic ones). Shi is **THE BEST** TA I've ever had. He is passionate and knowledgeable about the topics, and he is always happy to help. He explains concepts very clearly, and he even stayed 30 minutes after section (normally 1 hour) to help us review for an exam. Nicholas is also a wonderful TA and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course contents. They both help you a lot on psets if you come to their office hours/section. Exams in this class are somewhat confusing in the sense that you don't know what will be on them, but they are not extremely hard. Just review the material from class, read the notes, go to section before exams, and learn the psets, and you should be okay.",
      "Physics 151 is an incredibly useful class. You should know this material before taking upper level physics, including before taking 143a. However, this teaching staff is going to make the class more frustrating than it needs to be, so be warned.The good side: The material of 151 — Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics — ties together all the stuff you may have encountered in prior physics classes in a way that makes way more intuitive sense. This class finally made me feel like I UNDERSTAND how physics works, which was never the case before, even when I took quantum, 181, or GR. Jaffe's notes are incredibly dense and you will not need an external textbook. If you want to do theory, this is basically required. If you want to understand where 143a came from, this is basically required.The bad side: – Jaffe is 87 years old, and it shows. Lectures are a bit slow, and he has very high expectations. He won't start without someone asking him a question, which I actually didn't mind, but he also seems to expect the students to have more mathematical background than they do, which can feel frustrating because it seems like he's disappointed in us when we can't immediately calculate something. He's also a bit difficult to talk to during office hours.– The tests are old–school, with no formula sheet or study guide, and this is quite stressful; it feels like we're being tested on how much we drilled the formulas and proofs, rather than our understanding of the materials. And the grading is very harsh: many points will be removed for small mistakes (although this might just be our TF this year), and mistakes are double–counted in subsequent parts of questions.– The notes are quite hard to follow on their own. I personally took detailed lecture notes and used them for supplement, and this worked well for me. Be warned that you will need to pay attention in lecture in this way (i.e. focused) in order to grasp the material, because Jaffe's notes alone will not teach you the material.The project is fine. The structure of the class works very well, and they really know what they're doing. Just be warned about what you're going to get.",

Unless you are specifically interested in her research and *exactly* her research alone. Don't get me wrong, she's very smart and knowledgeable. But only take it if you want to do a basic fluffy review of E&M, then just obscure problems on sodium lasers and BECs and a bit about fiber optics, and not much else. The course is unstructured. While it provides interesting topics, it's too painstakingly dissected to feel like you get the big picture, with not much effort made to connect the topics to a broader context or other research disciplines (e.g work you might be doing as a grad student) other than the professor's research focus. Seriously, if you think you're going to get anything like a functional experimental understanding of optics, you're emphatically not. The closest you will come is an abstract understanding that lenses are Fourier transformers.Now, about grading: Hau is unforgiving and totally unwilling to compromise or understand the student's perspective (especially undergraduates from what I saw) on any of this. There are only six psets, and they are worth a lot of your grade. They will be graded harshly. Seriously, we all either got 100% because we painstakingly went to office hours to learn exactly what they want to see on the pset, or lost like 20–30% for small mistakes. This course is graded like it's the 1950s,  where B's were passing, so don't take it if you're an undergrad trying to get into competitive graduate school. Lastly, the final project and paper. You can work your butt off on the final presentation and paper, some real good work, but if it's not what the professor wants specifically, then you might get nailed. And regarding these projects: you need to know that these are not necessarily  \"literature reviews\" in that sense. The projects that Hau will give A's to fall into three categories: 1) she wanted you to do a literature review on an area she is interested in, so that she can maybe adapt some of the techniques for her own research (e.g. you basically do work for her interests). 2) You did some silly fun area that sounds cool and she doesn't know much about and she's entertained. 3) You went for a review of class materials and things she already knows: you will get grilled during the presentation on questions from the class.... have fun! <3 <3",

She is always patient and explains them in a very easy–to–understand way.  The lectures are well structured with clear studying goals. The homework is hard but related to the lectures. It helps with understanding the concepts.  Detailed HW solutions are handed in after each assignment so we can improve on that. The course does require some time commitment every week. The homework varies between 8–12 hours while the reading might take 3 hours per week.",

      "Prof. Khalaf was an excellent teacher and he was great at explaining an intuitive way to understand quantum mechanics. He also really knows his stuff and is very well organized coming into lecture. We covered a lot and the order in which we covered material made sense: everything blended together by the end of lecture. The homework can be tough sometimes, but it usually doable and you also have office hours with help. Although, since this is a grad level class there are few office hours, so I would make sure I can attend them weekly (not have other weekly commitments during the time). You gain a much deeper understanding of QM than after Phys 143a. Make sure you know linear algebra and some multivariable calculus and you should be fine with the math. Also Prof. Khalaf's lecture notes are GREAT, and usually enough to get ready for the exams. The exams include 2 long problems and one problem with many true/false questions. The long ones are usually doable and he tried to make them easier since the last time he taught the class the students complained (loved that he incorporated feedback, and also cared about it!), but the true/false are definitely challenging. In a good way though since they test deep understanding of material, which you gain by making sure you understand the lecture notes really well, since they include a lot of talk about why things work the way they do. Great class overall! Really loved it and learned a lot! Feel so much more comfortable now with quantum mechanics, and am so much more fascinated by it than I was before.",

      "QFT under Prof Schwartz is a very time–consuming but incredibly rewarding class. As an undergraduate, I definitely had to spend upwards of 20 hrs/week on this class (as the syllabus warns) – it is so helpful to read the textbook before lecture, and then the psets themselves are very time–intensive and took me 20 hrs/week. Prof Schwartz's textbook is fantastic and is much clearer than the lectures – I honestly did not take away much from lecture, since we go so fast that it was hard for me to absorb the content if I was seeing it for the first time and also take notes. However, reading the textbook before and then going to lecture just to internalize the content was helpful.The psets are pretty long and there are some questions that are kind of just mind–numbing soul–crushing algebraic calculations. But I guess that is the nature of the material, and is what you're signing up for in the end. However, this class was extremely rewarding for me – it was a very nice culmination of all the undergraduate physics classes I had taken before, and I walked away feeling more confident in my abilities as a physicist and understanding of physics in general. As someone who doesn't want to do high energy, not much of the content will be useful for me in the future, but I still think this class was worthwhile since I got exposed to some really cool physics that I otherwise wouldn't have a chance to see.The teaching staff was fantastic and in general very flexible with deadlines, which is greatly appreciated. The 48 hour final was very challenging for me but I think if you take time to really make sure you internalize the concepts and problem–solving approaches that are introduced in the psets, it is doable. I would highly recommend this class, but my only warning is that you really have to commit to taking it if you are an undergrad. This is not a class you can just cruise through and do the bare minimum – for me, to really understand the content, I did have to put in 20 hours/week like the syllabus says. So if you are willing and able to make that kind of commitment, I would definitely recommend it!",
      "If you want a real sense of the insanity that is this class, see last year's qguide for this class and find the really long review that mentions grandma's thanksgiving dinner. Can't miss it.As for my advice, just know what you're getting into and plan for it. That's the biggest marker for success in this course It's a crucial and really incredible course, I mean that. But it's also hard as hell. Very doable if you properly allocate time for it, very not doable if you don't. Everything is a simple harmonic oscillator. That is all.",

Your grade is based entirely on the 2 exams in the course that are non–cumulative, but there is an extra credit book club that would boost your grade by one step (B–>B+ or B+–>A–) which is a very helpful boost given how difficult the exams are and it gives great insurance that you will get a good grade in the course. The course is graded on a curve (60% get an A, 25% B, 15% everything else) and the curve, being as generous as it is, really saves your grade. The median on the first exam was ~75% and on the second it was ~70% so the curve brought a raw score of a C up to an A which is incredibly generous. On both exams, I studied a ton because I want to concentrate in psychology and wanted to do well in the course and my raw scores for both exams were 82% and 80% so my curved grade was an A. I also did the extra credit book club which is a great opportunity to get basically free extra credit and I recommend everyone to do it because the extra credit is very helpful when there are only 2 exams making up your entire grade.For studying for the exams it is truly just memorization of the bolded terms in the textbook and the experiments discussed in lecture. There are a lot of terms in the textbook that you have to memorize so a good trick that I used was that I rewatched all the lectures and just highlighted all the terms that were repeated in both lecture and the textbook and just studied those which saved me a ton of time and it made me rewatch all the lectures.

      "I really disliked this class for the following reasons:– Lack of rigor. I took psy 1 and psy 16 before this, and this class did not come close to the level of rigorous treatment of the field found in either of those. In other psych classes, each lecture will be devoted to a topic where you discuss theories and ideas drawing from many different studies that contribute to the topic, and you come away with a solid understanding of some things you didn't know before and where research needs to go next. In psy 1018, each day is devoted to one or two studies that don't have anything super deep to say. (For example, a whole day will be devoted to a study finding that major key + fast tempo are associated with people perceiving the music as happy.) In fewer words, I just didn't learn much in this class. It felt more like high school than college. To be fair, part of the problem is that the research in psychology of music in general is really lacking, so this might be more of a problem with the field than how the course is taught.– Lack of focus on psychology. A TON of time in this course is spent on things that just aren't psych. The main example is the final project, where you write a policy memo recommending some policy related to music. In practice, this means that most of the final project was spent researching things like: how to implement our policy, how much funding is necessary, how to make it politically realistic, etc., rather than the actual psychological questions that underlie it. I was really disappointed with the final project because I wanted a psych class and felt like I got an HKS class instead! This takes up a lot of class time as there were also some days throughout the class where we had a workshop to work on policy memo writing or poster design – very frustrating when you want a class about the brain and music. To a lesser extent, I have the same complaint about the time spent on things like research design and quality. An example is the day at the end of the course where we debated the merits of several studies on music therapy: useful for understanding *methodological* issues but not *psychological* issues in the field. (Very important to talk about in a psych class, but I thought it was over–emphasized). Overall, this class is really only partially about psychology, so be aware of this if you're planning to take the course.– Assignments. Truly none of them are particularly hard, but there are enough to keep you pretty busy. Here they are:–– Reflection reports. There are 5 of these. You do a short music–related activity and then write a 2 page paper connecting your experience to class literature. Kind of interesting, but you really won't learn anything profound from them.–– Critical evaluation of a media article. It's a 4 page paper where you summarize and criticize an article about music and the mind. Probably the best assignment in the class. Though again, this is about research methods far more than psychology.–– Quizzes. There are 2 of these. It's a multiple choice canvas quiz which is very unforgiving (e.g. 3 T/F questions rolled into one, and you need to get all 3 right to get the point). Requires you to repeat extremely specific information from studies and lectures. He LOVES asking tons of questions about which brain regions have which functions. The bright side is that it is open note/internet, so you mostly just have to ctrl + F to find the answers. There is absolutely no reason this should be a part of the course.–– Final project. Poster + poster session presentation + memo. (The end of the course really stacks up because you're also doing quiz 2 and reflection report 5 in the midst of all this). And you have to submit the memo to a real politician. Anyway I said what I think about this above so I'll shut up now.tl;dr I found this class really frustrating because I didn't learn much, I especially didn't learn much in the field of psychology, and yet there is plenty of busywork.I think it is very possible that the gripes I have with this class are me–specific. For context, I am a STEM concentrator + musician who is maybe doing a psych secondary but mostly took this class for fun. If you're interested in the class you should totally shop it. But my warning is this: if after a couple weeks in the class you're thinking that the class is still getting started and you're waiting for it to pick up some steam and get more interesting, it won't. Get outta there! If you're going to learn from + enjoy the class, that will happen early.In the spirit of fairness I do have some positive things to say!– The teaching team is actually very wonderful. Like even though I did not like the class, I do really like Mayron, Mehr, and Luciana as people. They are all very flexible and accommodating of whatever you have going on, so just talk to them about whatever you need and they'll figure it out. Mayron is actually a teddy bear, he is so friendly and welcoming and always has a smile on his face and brings a lot of joy and excitement about the subjective.– Music performances and activities in class were very fun!– Ultimately it is a very chill class, especially grade wise.",

      "As someone interested in both art and psychology, this class was 100% the perfect mix of both and did not disappoint. You come out of the class with a better understanding of psychology, research and the scientific method, and multiple different forms of art; although the primary focus is visual art, the material can be expanded to photography, music, dance, etc., and the discussion–based format of the class gave everyone a chance to share their personal experiences, meaning you get to hear a lot of perspectives on everything the class covers. The workload is also extremely manageable; 3–4 readings per week can be a lot, but the response papers are easy as long as you do the readings properly, and the projects are a good combination of synthesis of course material and having creative power to come up with your own unique ideas. Cynthia is also an absolutely fantastic professor who genuinely cares about her students, from meeting us all personally for coffee at the beginning of the semester to using our midterm feedback to drastically alter the structure of discussions and assignment prompts in a way that (I felt like) worked so much better. While a majority of the people in the class seemed like they had a personal background in some kind of art, I also feel like there is so much to be gained from this course if you don't have a background in any art forms. TL;DR fantastic class with a perfect intersection of psychology and art that you should 100% take, even if you're just considering it as an elective, if it sounds interesting to you at all!",

It is rare for 75 minutes to fly by in a lecture class, but Professor Lukas expertly balances wit and humor to deliver information in a truly enjoyable manner. I often wished the classes were longer because he does such a phenomenal job delivering the material and engaging with his students. Administratively, the course was very fair, with weekly quizzes that logically followed the lectures, a standard midterm and final, and a fun series of final debates. TF Cole also provided a welcoming, positive environment to go over material that was an extension of class. Taking this course is great if you are looking for a gateway course into psychology or a way to fulfill a divisional distribution requirement, but even more so for the lifelong lessons you will take about recognizing and supporting those with substance use disorders.

It caters to students of all kinds of backgrounds: there are seniors who have spent their entire college career studying the topics in these papers by majoring in neuroscience at Harvard and cognitive brain science at MIT, and they are able to go really deep into the papers.  There are students studying social studies, applied math, cs, etc. who are able to read these topics for the first time and gain just as much.  It really is an interesting mix of papers and students.  Also, the final project is super fascinating –– I wish more classes had projects like this because this really is the whole point of our education here: applying it.  It's challenging and worth it. The only thing is I wish it had a stronger sense of community.  It's a really small class and could lend itself to much better discussions if there was a stronger bond.

The only non–fun part of the class is the biweekly mandatory reading questions, but, as Dr. B says a previous student wrote, \"if we didn't have to do those I wouldn't have done the readings\", which is absolutely true, so completely fair in hindsight (and when it was clear the questions were too time–consuming, the prof did decrease them, so also very receptive to feedback).10/10 class, would definitely take again, if I could take seminars with Dr. B for the rest of my time here, I would.

Rarely at Harvard have I left a course wishing I could retake it the class, or have the class be longer. The class forces you to think, and each class I left either having changed my view (sometimes entirely), or better understanding why I hold it. Even better, the views you discuss are in one way or another tied to, well, pretty much everything. When ought we to dish out praise and punishment? What makes someone deserving of scorn, or the guillotine? You read in class academic publications, but also headlines from media outlets and Supreme Court Cases, providing you with such stimulating stimuli for discussion. Never have I had a class where there is such an intentional grounding of abstract concepts to societal translations.  In other words, I felt like I was growing as a person and as an academic. Also, this is the year where Luigi Mangione was indicted and also the Menendez Brothers Netflix show came out, and it was just such a fun class to have taken as convos about crime and criminality unfolded in common rooms and at dining halls. Also, the workload was not only manageable (a 300–500 word essay every few weeks, and then a term paper), they were so fun to write. Lastly, Professor Greene is a one–of–a–kind facilitator, and has a way of always finding the perfect question to challenge your point. If you get accepted to this course, ENROLL!!!

      "This is one of the best courses I've taken in the Psychology department! Professor H is a great lecturer and is a leader in the field of stigma, and his expertise shines through in the depth of his lectures and the care he has put into this course. Lectures are engaging and use a variety of different methods to help learning enforcement like small group discussions, in class quizzes, and short one on one debates that help to build engagement. The course is structured around a stigma a student chooses to study through the semester and provides ample opportunity to explore the aspects of the stigma students find most interesting. Nathan as a section leader is also phenomenal –– he does a great job of making students feel welcome and willing to speak up in section about potentially tender subjects around stigma and mental health. He truly cares about every student and has done a great job in facilitating discussion and intellectual openness in the course and was a key reason I looked forward to section every week.",

      "This class was much better than I expected honestly. Lectures were very interesting and Prof Cikara was super super knowledgeable on everything she spoke about, she made the class feel engaging, and she always helped us feel like we were doing well.Lab (section) was extremely helpful because we were able to work on our final projects during that time which saved our group time outside of regular class hours. Also, having the TF answer our questions immediately during lab helped save time with troubleshooting. We also learned how to use Qualtrics and reviewed R basics which definitely assisted with the final project.Readings were interesting but honestly should be skimmed because we only really use them during lecture and for the Slack discussion posts. Also, during lectures, Prof. Cikara always mentions the key takeaways and quotes from each reading so that’s useful.The final project was so fun if you have a good group. Make sure to have fun with your topic. As someone who did a survey instead of in–person trials, it is much easier to set up in the long run. Make sure to test your qualtrics survey MULTIPLE times before publishing it. Also, communicate well with your group and don’t let anyone take control.The assignments were really chill since they were graded based on completion, but make sure to do them to your best extent because I got all my feedback early on and by the time my draft was due, I didn’t need any more revisions before the final project. It saves you time during reading period and finals to avoid having to write most of the paper if you have it done already.Lastly, the exam was good if you payed attention to the prerecorded videos or during in person lecture. I took notes during lecture in person and didn’t watch the videos and got a good score. I wasn’t stressing like the people that skipped lecture most days",

I believe that we have zero tenured faculty of Pacific descent at this university, but that is another issue.Taking a class with Therese will not only transform your approach to learning and discussion, but it will require you to engage deeply with some of the most pressing issues of our time from an indigenous Pacific lens. That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Talanoa, or to talk/unveil, refers to a collaborative discussion approach to complex problems. Through talanoa, we build community, challenge norms, and facilitate understanding. This class was taught using Talanoa, which means that each student must come to class prepared to fully immerse themselves in the week's texts and topic(s). It was an unparalleled learning experience, and one that enabled students to form genuine connections with both each other and the material. Around 85% of texts that we read in REL 32 were by indigenous Pacific scholars. In most classes about topics in the Pacific that I have come across (at Harvard), the ratio is flipped. I think that in itself speaks volumes. Having an emic perspective on Pacific issues is absolutely fundamental to effectively and deeply engaging with it.  I come from a country in the Pacific, and for lack of a better word, this class felt like home. It felt like home in a place that can sometimes feel isolating.

Goudarzi's own research is also groundbreaking in its own right and it was always a treat whenever he would present on this in the class.  Super smart and humble guy! The class didn't have much emphasis on the ethics or linguistical aspects of Quranic analysis which would have been interesting but that is understandable given how jam packed the course already was. Alongside parts of the Quran as a primary readings, the other readings were fascinating, providing insights into frameworks of analysis, culture around different points in the Qurans history, key polemics, and more. Section wasn't very structured for this class this year but the class did not suffer because of that – I do think this element will be improved upon in future years for sure.

      "I do not think this course prepared me to participate in theoretical / methodological debates in the field. I came away from the course without a basic understanding of many or even most of the works on the syllabus. I have a few main points of feedback:– Kojo’s teaching style in this course was not accessible. He very frequently refers to theorists / theories or secondary sources that were not on the syllabus without explaining who they are or what they said (eg performativity theory, Butler, Habermas, Schussler Fiorenza, Asad, and so on). I rarely had the background knowledge necessary to understand those references, and the frequency of these references made the class very challenging for me to follow.– Relatedly, there was very little explanation of the main arguments / philosophical systems of the texts we read, even when they were dense philosophical works. Instead, the discussion started at the level of the texts’ implications for the study of religion and / or debates in the secondary literature about how to interpret them. This led to bad discussions because few people were prepared to engage with the text at that level (only those with prior knowledge) — so students’ comments were often based on fundamental misunderstandings and I (as well as I think most others) typically remained confused about the texts' core presuppositions and arguments at the end of the class.Those were the big issues in my opinion and the reason why I think this class unfortunately did not work. There were some other issues too:– unclear expectations. for example, never mentioning half the assignments on the syllabus again after the first week, until telling us toward the end of the semester that those assignments weren’t happening; or sending instructions for our final paper proposal on Friday when the proposal was due Monday– some weeks the syllabus included too many dense texts for us to give enough time to any of them in class–  I think there was not enough room in class for conversations to form between students without being cut off / redirected.I don’t want to seem overly harsh or negative, because I do really appreciate all the work that Kojo put into teaching us this semester. But I am giving my honest impression of where the class fell short in the hope that it can be improved for future cohorts.",

      "this class is good! personally, i am significantly better at reading/writing/grammar + wanted to improve my conversational skills, and i think this is a good space to do that. i knew most of the grammar points beforehand so that was nice, but i could see a lot of the grammar coverage being confusing or lacking. some of it goes quickly or is integrated into the material quite awkwardly, so coming in already knowing a lot of that was really, again, pretty helpful. the class is overall pretty funnily structured –– you create a character and everyone in the class is 'living' together in the same apartment building in paris. people had a lot of fun with that, and that definitely made parts of the class really fun. you'll write 'memoirs' about what your character has been doing lately, their interactions with other people in the building, etc. this part was really enjoyable! however, i will say that the rest of the homework assignments (reading a $50 online textbook, completing worksheet problems) were really annoying and more tedious than anything else. the quizzes were great –– if you study, you'll definitely do well on them! and lucie, our TF, was lovely. i think it was sometimes hard because the TFs have to adhere to the main course head and the main course materials, and even she rightfully thought/recognized that some of the course materials were annoying, we had to get through them nonetheless. oh well.tl;dr –– good way to get through the language requirement, but definitely some tedious/annoying assignments and stuff! thank you lucie!! you're the best!",

      "While I love French language and culture, this class was not my favorite. The actual course content is interesting, with applications in journalism and current events and media. The pre–set materials also seem well organized, but they weren't utilized much in my class. There are many types of assessments, which can help you show your learning in different ways. However, be aware that there are MANY assignments/projects, including multiple exams, podcasts, and essays. I found this quite time consuming, which was frustrating especially considering I only took this class for the language requirement, not my concentration. Some exams were very challenging, too, at least to me. There were listening comprehension components with strong accents that we had never practiced listening to before. I surely want to be able to comprehend different accents, but I would have appreciated previous exposure during class or as homework so I could practice/familiarize myself––not have to hear it for the first time ever on an exam. At times, the class felt more intense than it needed to be to be effective. Further, sometimes class requirements and deadlines weren't the clearest. Honestly, I think the success of this class depends on the teacher and on the class environment. Especially with learning a new language, you're going to be making mistakes – and that's okay! Ideally, you want a safe, welcoming space where you can make mistakes, accept it, and learn all together. Unfortunately, I personally didn't have this experience. From my perspective, I felt stressed walking into this class. I spent years learning French in high school, and I took French20, but I felt inadequate and far behind everyone else in this class. This could, of course, just be my internal feelings and interpretations; it's hard not to compare yourselves to others when you're speaking a foreign language. But I do think the class culture contributed, too. My teacher encouraged us to make mistakes –– but at times it really didn't feel like encouragement. I felt humiliated when I made mistakes, as my teacher would  randomly call on us and have us repeat the same mistake again and again, as the class laughed, and the teacher seemed kind of amused or disparaging––I'm not quite sure how to describe it––as I kept failing. I can usually laugh at myself and let it go, but this really wasn't a good feeling. It felt almost expected that I would be able to speak extremely well, especially among classmates who seemed to speak near–fluently. I felt like I was stumbling along next to people leagues ahead of me in the French language. But that's the thing!! Everyone comes into this class with different backgrounds, different levels of fluency, different dialects, etc. Some people had even been speaking it from home for years. This diversity is really cool and should be embraced, celebrated, and adapted for! Again, from my perspective, it felt expected that everyone speak at a high level of exactly Parisian French.  The class didn't feel very inclusive to the ability and language diversity in our classroom. And it felt at times that because I was at a \"lower\" level, I was working very hard and putting great effort and time into my assignments, only to receive grades that seemed overly critical at times. I wondered what the baseline for grading was; I wondered if my personal starting level was being taken into account and not held to a higher than fair standard, and I can hope that that was the case.  Grades did become more generous near the end of the semester. Once again, this experience is my own, specific to the teacher and class I had. To end on a positive, I enjoyed when our class conversations diverged into French politics; my teacher created some interesting discussions out of that!",
      "This course was very unorganized and incredibly inaccessible. The website needs to be more straightforward and organized on Canvas and documents and resources need to be more accessible. We never knew when assignments or tests were and our TF never read the syllabus or knew what was going on and couldn't effectively teach us. The TF needs to be more prepared and also always showed up late to section. The TF also harassed and targeted students with different French accents such as Creole, Cajun, Polynesian, and Quebecois.",

You can do well in the course with a solid foundation of conjugations and basic grammar. Even though you would not encounter assignments extremely complicated, they tend to be too many, and it is easy to get behind if you do not do them on time. Take the course if you like languages, want a citation, or simply because you are interested in it, but keep in mind that there will be multiple small assignments that should not be underestimated just because they do not seem too complicated. For example, homework for a week might be five pages of exercises (reading and grammar), a recording of a short video (3 minutes), and an in–class writing composition of 400 words. I took the course because I am doing a citation in French but I enjoyed it! It is also a good way to balance your schedule because all the assignments are done by the last day of classes so you don't have to worry about this class during reading period.

      "My experience with this is complicated because I think the department is great, and nearly all of the teachers are fantastic. If your TF/prof is Marcia or Jaqueline or Chris, I'm sure your experience will be great and you should disregard anything else I say about the class.Having a different TF who was new, I found the class incredibly difficult, not because it was a lot of work or the material was very hard but because I felt like I had to teach myself the material and I never understood what I was supposed to learn or what the expectations were. I was so looking forward to this class because I know it has been phenomenal in recent years but it was honestly the worst class I've taken at Harvard. That being said, I really do have faith that it will become a great course again. I would suggest just listening to your gut about your TF in the first few weeks because I think it is likely that the teaching staff will change from semester to semester. If you feel like the course is really not working for you, then just drop it. Please do not use what I have said as a reason to not try this course because you will be missing a great opportunity. In many sections, this course is super fun and educational. All I am saying is that if you're unsure, just shop the class and if you don't vibe with the TF then drop it, but DO SIGN UP (and it you have any concerns, please contact the course staff because they are incredible).  Takeaway: the Portuguese department is fantastic. This class will probably be great, but TFs matterPLEASE GO TO LANGUAGE TABLE – it can make the entire course experience. I know it's hard to commit to an extra thing but I swear its worth it. Choose that over studying if you have to",

She is the kind of person who truly cares about each of her students' well–being, and that is clear in the passion and energy she brings to every single class. Because I had such a positive experience, I want to keep studying Portuguese! Any student wanting to learn about a beautiful culture and language can do so in an stress–free, positive environment, especially if the course is taught by Marcia.

The films are really fascinating and we also learn about the cultural and historical context of Brazil during the time periods of the films which was equally fascinating. We genuinely do speak completely in Portuguese in class but its also totally ok to ask for clarification of a word or phrase in English. Don't be intimidated by the essay or the oral presentation, as the expectations for them are very reasonable. This is a really great class to take if you have a heavy pset load because the homework is just watching movies (one or two per week) and the occasional short discussion post. Attendance is 100% mandatory though. Overall, I highly recommend this class to anyone that is really interested in Brazil and is at an intermediate Portuguese level (especially Brazilian Americans!!)",

      "If you want to learn Spanish and be supported and excited about the language, DO NOT take this course. I have never struggled so hard in my life, and I would highly recommend staying away from this course unless you have a Spanish background. The course description says that you do not need a background in Spanish to take this course, but you walk in the first day and the instructor only speaks English for 15 minutes and then Spanish for the rest of the semester. This course is so dependent on the TF, and there needs to be more consistency between sections on grading or learning experience. I felt like my TF hated me, and he graded our class very harshly. When you would ask questions about course material, you would get ridiculed by the instructor because that topic had \"already been covered in class.\" There is little to no preparation for the written quizzes, and it is crazy that an intro class expects you to write 100 word+ essays in full Spanish and then have a TF count off 1 point for every small mistake in the quiz. My grade suffered, and there was no support in class to help bring it up. I even asked for extra work and guides for the quizzes, and hardly ever was granted that. As for feedback, my TF marked up our quizzes but never followed up with us about our mistakes, and I was even given a comment telling me to \"try harder\" after not doing well on a quiz. The department does not care and could only offer 30–minute tutoring sessions. DO NOT take this class if you value your self–esteem or you have a genuine interest in learning the Spanish language. My TF and the department have turned me away from ever wanting to continue this language, and I am now struggling to fill my language requirement after the trauma this class induced. It was truly the worst part of my semester, and I would not recommend it for anyone; my GPA will suffer thanks to it.",

If you have never taken Spanish before, start in Spanish 10, as this course requires a bit of background preparation (I started in Spanish 10 having never taken Spanish before in my life). However, unlike Spanish 10, this course does not have a midterm, a midterm oral exam, or a final; thus, I found this course to be less stressful and I was able to indulge myself more in to learning the language rather than just worrying about exams. This course has four unit quizzes and one oral exam at the end of the course. I enjoyed this course more than Spanish 10, it has a larger emphasis on learning Spanish through historical content and cultural knowledge which I really enjoyed.

      "Wow, this course was a lot. Reading the Q guide from previous years, I took this class expecting to improve my spanish in a small–class setting, in a relatively low stress way. I came in having some spanish background from high school, but having forgotten a lot of it. While the class was very small (6 students including me), it turned out to be pretty stressful and a lot of work. THIS CLASS IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTOR DEPENDENT!!! Majo, the instructor this year, was very energetic and excited to teach, which made the class fun, especially at 9 am. But she was definitely strict in certain ways, much more than last year's instructor. First, we were only allowed 3 absences, which is very few for a 9 am that meets every day (over 60 times total throughout the semester).  These absenses included religious and medical absences, which was a bit crazy. Also be prepared for the commitment this class takes ... there are nightly Canvas modules, 22 graded homeworks, 5 written exams, 5 class presentations, 5 reports to accompany the presentations, 3 conversations you need to have with native speakers with follow up written reports, all on top of showing up  every morning and actually putting in the time outside of class to learn the material. While I enjoyed the class at times, especially toward the beginning of the semester, the sheer number of assignments became overbearing and frustrating by about the half–way point. I often felt like I was doing busywork that wasn't actually improving my spanish. The best assignments/classes/activities were the ones where we could talk to native speakers and classmates about everyday things because that is most realistic if traveling to a spanish speaking country, but these activities were few and far between the long writing assignments and sometimes long homeworks.  Despite it being a lot of work, I am definitely coming out of this class better at speaking spanish and writing spanish. I am very appreciative of this.To conclude, if you put in the work in this class, everything will work out just fine (you will learn a lot and do well), but make sure you have the time before committing to taking it. It definitely feels like an 8 credit class.",

      "This class was absolutely incredible and was probably my favorite this semester. The quality of language instruction was incredibly high and for a language that is so difficult and unlike English, Pani Iryna did a wonderful job with balancing the difficulty of learning so many new concepts so quickly with having fun and reinforcing what we had already learned. Additionally, there were so many enriching things we did outside of class to develop our understanding of Polish language and culture including museum visits, cooking workshops, and visits from past students. Also, the Slavic department does so much amazing programming that I would highly recommend taking advantage of. The expectations of the course are very reasonable and Pani Iryna is very receptive to feedback during the course. Her feedback on assignments and homework is always incredibly fast, helpful, and thorough. I tested out of the language requirement but still took Polish to gain a better understanding of my heritage and have never had a single regret. If you are even a little interested in Polish or are looking for a fun and meaningful challenge, take this class!",

      "TLDR: Take this class – my favorite class of all time! At the end of this course you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian very well at a basic level! I now feel confident to strike up a conversation and can hold my own. If you're unsure just pull up to the first class, you'll love it so much you'll stay!(Much) Longer version:Professor:– Dima (Dmitrii), the professor, is the best professor of all time. Seriously he cares so much, he's incredible enthusiastic, and makes the course an incredible amount of fun. He is the greatest professor I've ever had and should be a tenured professor with several awards named after him. With him, you don't just learn the language. As you learn more Russian in terms of grammar, vocab, and speaking you will also learn poems, songs, watch a movie, record a video, and read a story! You don't just learn the language but appreciate and learn about the culture. – Dima and Roy (the TF) put in so much work and make it so fun and easy for you to learn. Definitely some of the best and hard working faculty on this campus.If you're thinking of taking this course:1) Go to the first day – if you love it like I did, you'll likely stay but please go – it's incredible2) Yes it is actually 2 courses worth of work – see the structure (if you really want to think of it as 1 course think about it this course has around the same or higher median amount of work outside of class as notorious classes like – Stat110, EC1011a, Chem 27, CS 124 – but instead of 3h of class a week you have 8h).  I.e. think of it as 2 classes and you'll be fine since then it's closer to 2 medium classes work or 1.5 hard classes. If you're between doing Russ AAB (8 credit) vs AA (4 credit) here's what to know:1) you will spend 8h of class instead of 5h and do 1.5–2x the work but move through double the material. You learn much more, become more fluent and it's epic.2) At the end of the semester you will know all the Russian cases and be able to understand and speak basic Russian really well (fluency is gained not only by how much time you spend learning but also but in what timeframe, i.e. doing 2x the work in the same time results in learning more than 2x quicker)3) The students who take this really want to be here. They came to learn the language and so people are more focused, interesting and you learn from each otherIf you want to talk to people who have taken the course/are unsure:– Talk to Dr Clancy and/or Dima AND ask them to connect you with students who have taken the course – they are happy to and we are happy to give you our unfiltered takes (which is we loved it but we'll also be real about the amount of work and if this course is right for you).Structure (and to give an idea of what the time breakdown looks like):– To start with the reason you have so much work is because if you do the work you will learn – it's intentionally structured this way. This isn't like other classes where you need to put in time outside of the homework to actually learn. – 8h of class a week of which 3h is small speaking section (usually like 1:30 or like 10:30 or some combo but happens MWF) and 5x normal class every morning. The small speaking sections will fit around your schedule don't worry. Not sure who the TF will be but they will teach Tuesday and Thursday mornings and grade assignments while Dima will teach the small speaking sections as well as the MWF mornings.– Approx 2h a day of HW for Mon–Thurs – Friday you have a vocab test (you should spend like 20m a day studying)– Weekly (take home) unit tests which take more or less 1h– Check your HW and Unit tests after they've been graded to learn from errors– Midterm and Final (Oral and written) – Dima has practice exams which are super useful!!(If we're being honest, even though you should, you're probably not doing it EVERY day, but try space it out, maybe do it in 2 or 3 sessions in a week – DO NOT leave it for one day a week, you will feel behind all week, spend the entire Sunday working, and it's not fun)Grades:– Like most language at Harvard, don't worry – if you learn the language (which you will), you will do well. (no I will not be elaborating but when I say don't worry about the grade I truly mean it because if you instead just learn the language you will do great and have fun).– I mean you're not really taking this course because you are worried about a grade but rather you want to learn the language... BUT this course doesn't have tricks it's straightforward with course staff who want you to success and at no point is there surprises or are you trying to be caught out. Other vibes:– The Russian Students Society host fun and epic events and get to meet and practice Russian.– The Slavic Languages program have fun events like the weekly Lowell Language Table, crepe making etc. The faculty are uber accessible and it's always a good time.– The Davis Center for Eurasian studies has awesome events you should attend to learn more about politics, people, region.",

      "This is an amazing course; if you're on the fence about taking it, I would strongly advise doing so. This course provides the opportunity to engage with a wide variety of different forms of Russian art—short stories, novels, plays, operas, ballets, movies, and more. The entire syllabus is thoughtfully selected, and provides a great taste of fundamental Russian art pieces from the 19th century.  Prof. Buckler is extremely knowledgable about all of the material, and does a fantastic job adapting the course throughout the semester to respond to student feedback. If you're curious about any specific aspects of the history, reception, criticism, etc. of the works that are covered, she also does a great job responding to individual interests. That said, this course is not at all intimidating, and is quite friendly to those without any prior exposure to Russian art / literary analysis (I've never taken a course like this, and was still able to confidently contribute to each discussion). Weekly readings are substantial but not overwhelming, and assignments are not stressful (the oral exam was slightly scary in its uniqueness, but I felt well prepared to take it). The final project is open–ended, so you have the opportunity to play to your strengths.",

      "If you are looking for an accessible way to dip your toe into Russian literature, then this is the course for you! Professor Buckler is extremely engaging, and the syllabus is well–curated. You will be guided through the Russian greats with attention to the history as well as the culture. There was good variety too –– we watched an opera, a ballet, and several movies to complement the literature. The midterm oral exam was slightly stressful, but if you were reading along and paying attention in class, you would be able to study without much difficulty. I have taken a LOT of literature courses (senior, humanities major) and this one was excellent. It wasn't a gem, per se, but that meant that people were actually there because they were interested, which was well worth it. Give small departments a try!"

      "It is because I adore Nabokov that I abhorred this class. I'm a senior in English, and this is easily one of the worst lit classes I've taken. Lecture was useless to anyone but the first–years who commandeered the discussion to fit their own needs. No, not the small discussion sections—the in–lecture fifty–person discussion that took up one of the two precious hours of lecture/week. Yes, the first hour of lecture was a hollow handful of \"big ideas;\" the second was asking students what they liked/disliked about the book. One might think that if every week one exclaims, \"I wish I had more time!\" at the end of the first hour, one might find \"more time\" in the second hour,  but then of course one might miss out on \"learning from one's students\" by barely facilitating a \"conversation\" (read: \"confusingly long queue of raised hands\"). This pedagogy is clearly inspired by Nabokov himself:\"The best method of teaching anything is to rely on discussion in class, which means letting twenty young blockheads and two cocky neurotics discuss for fifty minutes something that neither their teacher nor they know\" (Nabokov, Pnin Ch. 6).We were not promised a Nabokov expert, but we were promised a course appropriate for grad students and discussions that would \"benefit everyone.\" I'm all for inclusive enrollment, and I think everyone can have valuable input, but there is also a responsibility to respect all students' time and expectations. It is an insult to make a course essentially intro–level to meet inexperienced but vocal students, rather than encouraging them to find a more suitable class and come back next year. It would benefit those students as well to find someone who will actually encouragingly challenge rather than indiscriminately indulge their comments. Nabokov (esp. Lolita) is truly difficult to read, and some of the heavier/more complicated subject matters and literary concepts were handled with the grace of a panda—not because of the discussers' ideas or attitudes, but because our non–lecturer had simply failed to teach us how to discuss such things. No matter how earnest and hard–working some members of the crew are, when the captain leaves the helm for a nap, everyone on the ship goes down. On a positive note, the only lectures that truly balanced the novels, biography, history, philosophy, and intertextuality in an educational and engaging way were the two excellent guest lectures presented by the TFs. I learned so much about Russian/French lit from the materials my wonderful TF prepared for our sections. If the \"who\" and/or \"how\" of this course ever changes, please do take it—Nabokov's work is some of the cleverest, funniest, and most beautiful writing out there.",
      "The texts are amazing and you should read Nabokov at some point, so do it with a group! Definitely do the reading because you will be quizzed on tiny details, but if you read the books you will have no trouble acing the quizzes. The essays are low stakes, and I had one of my best humanities sections EVER in this course (Maria you are the best). The lecture is a little awkwardly formatted –– the discussion section can drag on –– but you can express your ideas to your heart's content.  Only take the class if you're actually going to read all of the novels.",

      "TAKE ANYTHING THAT BOHDAN TEACHES. Yep, just go ahead and click enroll. You won't regret it, I promise. (Even if it's your 5th course) And if there is a time conflict this semester, make it a priority to take his course next semester (or, better yet, make the conflict go away). Taking a course with Bohdan is truly a bucket list item. Genuinely the best professor ever. He brings such enthusiasm and a wealth of knowledge to every class that it's impossible to leave each class not suddenly finding a new interest you never knew you had. I'm not even a slavic major and I took this course on a complete whim after having a random conversation with him –– best. decision. ever.He really meets you where you are (our class had two engineering majors and a chem major but then also a Slavic grad student and a Ukrainian student and he really leveled the playing field for everyone). This course was genuinely the highlight of every week and literally my only complaint is that it didn't meet more because we always had more to talk about. Like he would dismiss class, and one person who had somewhere to go would leave, but everyone else would stay back and chat for half an hour every week.He is so accessible in office hours if you want more feedback or just want to chat. He knows so much about Ukrainian literature and history –– he personally translated much of what we read. And on the off chance he doesn't know the answer to one of your questions, he writes it down and comes to you next week with the answer. He brought one of the authors we read (who is also one of the most famous living Ukrainian writers and performed at the Grammys) to Cambridge and invited us all to dinner with her.He gives super detailed feedback and works with you every step of the way on your final paper. He also asks every week what the rest of your workload looks like and he makes sure to adjust the work so that he's not assigning a lot during those couple weeks in the semester when everyone else is going crazy. I would take this course again in a heartbeat if I could. He opened my eyes to a whole new world. Bohdan proves that you can be both an expert in your field and a great professor. He is what I want my tuition going to and Harvard needs to hurry up and give him tenure ASAP before someone else poaches him. [goes to thesaurus.com to find more positive adjectives] Life–changing. Transcendent. Perfection. [For context: I'm not a Slavic major, and my Q responses are usually somewhat critical].Seriously, what are you still doing reading this review?

I felt quite confused and getting lost in the dense theory, but I think the teaching staff does a great job of guiding you through it and helping you understand their theoretical traditions/perspectives. I ultimately feel like it was worth it to learn about them, even though it was challenging at first, because I'm glad to have a working understanding of the canonical sociological theories as a jumping off point for my future interaction with sociology and the social sciences in general. Basically, this class is not a bad class to fulfill a requirement and the teaching staff is quite understanding and accommodating (Jane is a great TF).

I will say that it definitely is more history–focused than I had thought, but it's easy to connect these historical topics to our current day. But, honestly I would take any class that Adaner teaches regardless of the topic.  It's clear how much he cares about his students, both as scholars and people.  He holds \"coffee chats\" after class where students can sit with him and discuss anything that they're interested in.  Everytime someone asks a question he'll nod and say \"great question\", regardless of how good the question actually is. Its clear that he wants to provide an environment where everyone feels comfortable to express their opinions and contribute to the class.",
      "I had a lot of issues with the course. Although Adaner's teaching is engaging I often found myself very lost and confused because of the structure and way he teaches. In addition to that for the final you had to create a presentation in the same way he does and as someone who could never understand the way he teaches I really struggled with that. In addition to that there wasn't much help, clarifications, or even examples given to us to help us with the assignments which further added to my confusion especially for the last assignment. Finally, I think the way the tf graded the assignments was incredible difficult and unreasonable, he would take off points for petty things that didn't quite make sense under the explanation that the proffesor wanted to make sure not everyone recieves an A in the class and finds it easy which is quite silly to me",

      "Put simply, this course is a straight up slam–dunk, could not recommend it highly enough – if you have room in your course schedule please take it. The coursework is honestly easy but still incredibly thought–provoking and engaging. Kristie and Brian are easily the best part of this course – they collectively fostered an atmosphere that was conducive with class participation and active collaboration. They're somehow exactly in tune with all of our needs as students at every stage of the game, and they're some of the kindest teachers I've ever met. There's a lot of takeaways from this course; not to spoil too much, but you learn about how education is equal part politics as it is \"objective,\" you learn how pivotal education is in shaping people as human beings, and you learn about a plethora of diverse stakeholder perspectives. In short, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this course. I strongly recommend any and all future students to take it with great enthusiasm.",
      "This class approaches the content in a very problematic manner, as is largely dismisses or understates the importance of race, class, and gender in the American education system. While the course covers a lot holistically, the narrative that introductory material needs to dismiss or decenter these factors is a dangerous idea to reproduce. Professor LeBeau does not really offer a lot when it comes to discussing these ideas, and discusses them with an elementary effort that seems to rely on the fact that she does not specialize in race, class, or gender studies. Class discussion is profuse, which is nice, but LeBeau does not offer a lot of stimulus and generally just lets students speak without a lot of guidance or stimulus.",

David and George are SO awesome. They're very passionate about the course topics, and the course is structured in a really nice way. They're also very open to receiving feedback (about the midterm for example) and genuinely care about our learning. I especially loved section because George (who's an MD–PhD in Sociology) presented sociology scenarios in medicine with case scenarios and medical minutes. We had really interesting discussions, and I really enjoyed class and section. I'm confident that everything I learned this semester will help me in the future.

      "If you are a sociology major, I would encourage you to take this course over Stat 100. It is definitely more tailored to the social sciences and from what I heard, also a bit more manageable.  This course was small enough that you could get to know the professor 1–1 and get help that way. Additionally, my TF section leader Soroush was very kind and always eager to help whether that meant moving his availability around to help me. Seriously, he once met with me while he was at the airport about to go on vacation so that I could understand how to do my final project analysis. I came into this course with no coding background whatsoever, and the assignments in this course, while definitely a bit challenging, were doable. Yes, I would be confused during lecture, but attending section taught me whatever I didn't get during the lecture. That said, if you struggle with R like I did, try to block out time to do p–sets. I wish I had started earlier than when I usually did so that I could have attended office hours since some concepts required more time than I thought. The professor is also very kind and would slow down during lectures when he noticed students were grasping what he was teaching. This teaching team was very responsive to student needs and I appreciated that. I wouldn't call this course a gem but if you put in the effort, it can be. Do go to office hours and sections, especially if you have no background because without it, I do not see you being successful.  The final paper, while intimidating, is broken down throughout the semester. For example, we turned in our abstracts in October, our code in November, and finally the project in December. The teaching team does their best to prepare students for this during class so it's not just ignored. The midterm was open–notes and you could use past p–sets so as long as you have a rough idea of the content until then, you should be good to go. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, even though I hate coding, as it was well organized. Once again, if you are a sociology major, I'd take this over any other options to fulfill the requirement.",

      "I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course to anyone interested in understanding the complexities of poverty and social justice issues. The guest speakers were definitely one of the best parts of the class. They brought real–world perspectives that helped connect the material to real–life experiences, making the course content much more engaging and accessible. Their personal stories really brought the issues to life in a way that statistics and theories alone couldn’t. I also really enjoyed the course section with Kyle—it provided an opportunity to dive deeper into topics like education, low–wage work, homelessness, and housing, exploring how they are all interconnected and contribute to poverty. These discussions were thought–provoking and sparked some truly meaningful conversations.That said, be prepared for a heavy reading load each week—it can get overwhelming if you're not on top of your time management. But if you can manage it, this course will definitely expand your perspective and help you understand the structural issues that keep poverty in place. One of the things I loved most about this course is that there are NO EXAMS—just field report assignments, which are only five pages, and the final is another field report plus a five–page reflection on the class. I really liked this because it gave us the chance to conduct interviews or observational studies, which made the assignments feel more hands–on and connected to real–world issues. TAKE THIS CLASS—it’s easy and a great way to learn about such an important subject. Plus, Professors Waldman and Wallerstein are both so nice and supportive!",

The class is really fun, people joke around a lot and it feels more like I'm with a group of small friends than a class. Sections are small, so maximum teacing time. About sections, Hajnalka Kovacs is actually great. Reviews last year dragged her into the mud, so much so that I was scared to get her, but she's awesome. She really knows her stuff (as our awesome TA Tulaib said) and is very chill with how much attention people pay. With minimal instruction, she got me to understand Hindi's grammar system form zero knowledge. You would think that a grammar–focused approach would be boring, but she makes it suprisingly effective and intuitive, even if class can be dry sometimes.",

      "BE PREPARED TO WORK! This is no longer a super easy class, and in fact, most students struggled a lot under Julie. Keep in mind that the class is drastically changing for next semester and future years, so not everything here will be applicable.Firstly, the class was a flipped classroom, meaning you watched a video of Julie teaching you coding and statistics, and that was super boring and unhelpful. You also will have weekly quizzes, but don't worry about missing points, you get the chance to make up wrong answers at the end of the semester. The exams are NOT take home, unlike other intro statistics classes like STAT 104. The in–person midterm was MISERABLE, but the final was much more fair. If you did better on your final, your midterm score basically disappears which is nice. Overall, this class is super helpful in teaching you data analysis in R. However, it will be hard! Please please please go to office hours and make a true connection with them. They are so amazing and super fair with grading! They taught me the most in this class and NOT the videos Julie posted. So please, go to office hours!!! I went to at least 10 hours every week to get my psets done because there was just no other way. ALSO, be aware this class has no curve! But an A is still possible as I was able to pull it off with no coding experience.",
      "Julie is really nice but isn't the best instructor, especially when you have to force yourself to listen to her on weekends (the time when we should be resting). She can feel a bit lethargic and the concepts aren't elaborated or practiced in–depth enough for problem sets to be so difficult.",

      "Stat104 is both challenging and time–consuming, but it is a great introduction to statistics for any who are wanting to pursue it. The problem sets are often long and take a lot of work, including going to multiple office hours per week, to be completed with quality. Make sure to go to the study breaks! They are very helpful in getting you started on the psets early in the week and you can ask any and all questions you have. Kevin is very engaged with the course, his lectures are extremely effective (always attend lectures in person!!!) and he is always available for questions. The midterms in this class are pretty hard; make sure you really understand the material at a conceptual level, just doing calculations and \"following a checklist\" is not going to cut it. The final has 2 components: one week–long take home exam and an oral interview, it will require a lot of time during finals week but is completely doable. I would honestly be more concerned with the midterms. I didn't find the section component particularly helpful, and since attending is not mandatory, I would recommend just going through the section worksheets on your own. Don't worry at all about the use of R, stat104 is not a coding class and you can always get help with any code during office hours/study break. I would 100% recommend this course, just go into it knowing it will be a heavy class, both in terms of content and course load.",

      "CS1090a is an AMAZING course. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm to anyone interested. I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q–guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. Advantages of CS109a:0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students' learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students' understanding of the material.  1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. 2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi–weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time–consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10–20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi–weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast–paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don't look back!",
      "Pavlos is great and it's easy to tell that he cares a lot. It's also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job–skills wise if that's what you're going for.That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics–wise. This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn't reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us \"you guys did a great job\" as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you're on track or not in the course.My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare–tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take–home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms/assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF–ing, while student B ends up with an A– because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.",

      "Take this course! It absolutely changes the way that you think. Regardless of whether or not you are the type of person who really enjoys rigor (if you do, there's really no reason not to take this class), the content in this class elevates your problem–solving skills. It's difficult to explain, but I think I left this class as a completely different student. I enrolled in this class because I wanted a very \"mathy\" introduction to probability my freshman year, as I came in with quite a strong mathematical background in high school and since I intend to major in AM anyways. What I got back was so much more than just probability theorems and calculus. This class was essentially a course in the science of problem–solving, and the assignments and exams are structured such that you easily see where you can apply the theory you learn in class. Though I felt pretty certain at the start of my semester that I'd stick with AM/Econ, this class has me seriously considering a switch to the Stat concentration. I'm taking Stat 111 in the Spring and could not be more excited. Prof. Blitzstein is a fantastic lecturer and I highly recommend attending each lecture, though if you choose otherwise just know that the textbook is really well–written. It does an amazing job of simplifying abstract concepts into stories and examples that are easy to fully comprehend after just a bit of practice. The book is somewhat of a holy grail for this class so make sure to read through it, especially when you get stuck on psets. The exams and psets are certainly difficult, and the midterm was particularly a big wakeup call for me. The content itself can be hard to wrap your head around. That said, the teaching team is spectacular. They truly care about helping you improve and I highly recommend leveraging Office Hours to ask clarifying questions. I feel like all of the teaching assistants are really passionate about Stat 110 and are excited to help you out when you have questions. It makes it easy to stay motivated in this class. It's also very apparent that Prof. Blitzstein is a passionate professor and cares about you as an individual. He's understanding when you might need an extra extension and takes the time to break down your exams with you. TL;DR Take this course, yes it's hard, Professor and TFs are great, reading textbook is key.",
      "This class was extremely hard – 20hrs+ on psets alone each week, most of them at office hours. This class really breaks down your ego when you realize that you cannot even start any of the problems without help. I did every single pset and went to every single lecture and section, and still things did not \"click\" for me – I would be lost every time I saw a new problem. Not fun. Also overcrowded office hours stress you out a lot.",

      "There were some aspects of this class that I absolutely loved. However, the organization of the class made it extremely frustrating and overwhelming at times. It was in its first iteration this semester, so I really hope that they can make changes so that it runs smoother next year. It's a class with a lot of potential, but it needs substantial restructuring so that it can be more successful. I think this is a course that would really benefit from having a TF!!! Here are my pros/ cons:PROS:– Super intellectually interesting. You'll learn a lot about biostatistics and get exposed to new statistical methodologies. – Class is really engaging. Because it's so small, it is not a typical statistics lecture. There is a lot more room for class discussion.– Weekly readings (research articles) are interesting, I actually enjoyed doing them and became more comfortable reading articles.– Final project will definitely push you. If you put the time in, you'll get a lot out of it.CONS:– As of right now, we have not received one pset grade back from the whole semester. We've also not received grades back from the take–home portion of the midterm. It makes it harder to learn and improve if you never get feedback.– Midterm was very stressful. Note that there are two components (in class and take home) in a few day period in the middle of the semester. It's a lot of work in a concentrated period of time. – Nothing (psets, readings, lecture solutions, project information) was ever posted when we were told it would be. If you like to be able to plan ahead, or like learn from solutions, this can be a challenge.– Final project is a lot of work. Kevin has high expectations for the statistics you'll be able to do (even if it wasn't actually covered in class). Not necessarily a bad thing, just something to know as you think about workload at the end of the semester. Again, I really hope that this course can get a TF next year. If Kevin was only responsible for the lectures, and a TF handled all the grading/ feedback/ assignment release, the class would have run a lot smoother and I would be able to confidently say that I recommend the course.",

I think there is some value in reading the slides, and I did and did get some education from it, but it is skimmable and not the best presented (though I have seen worst in other classes, 139 slides are not that bad).If you pay attention in learning though, I think you do get some knowledge in the practical side of linear models. Sure, we were introduced to linear models at multiple points in our lives, but this class really nails it down and gives some theoretical backing and the entire backstory and a suite of theoretical tools (that have been implemented in R) to help you diagnose and validate your linear models.

In that regard, 139 has strong potential to be a good class if it is well–run.Midterm is terrible because they don’t give us material like past/mock midterms to prepare for it, and the textbook is bad as I said, so it’s just a ranking of who can get their shit together and learn linear models somewhere or by paying strong attention to the slides and did some own revision with other sources.The Ed is also unresponsive, but sometimes James will answer, but for the most part, God bless the STUDENT Jordan Seigel for answering Ed questions.

      "Here's my honest guide to Reinforcement Learning :)[Prereqs]:STAT 110 I think is a must with its statistical knowledge.Linear Algebra and Multivariate are also highly encouraged so you understand the math.I don't really think any other CS course is needed, just know how to program in Python.[Overall]:If you want to really understand the field of RL, this class does it so well.  The math is challenging but the class never felt overly–difficult because you had a lot of resources with office hours, recaps in lecture, and sections. The class leading up to the midterm is the more \"harder\" part in that the midterm is written.  Please study for it, it basically determines the variability in grades in the class.  The post–midterm part of the class' material gets more challenging but you get to do a project and I absolutely love projects because you can deep–dive into a part of RL that you like on a topic you love, so it becomes less hard.[Problem Sets]:Pretty average problem sets with written/proof parts and programming parts.  Programming isn't bad at all, it's just writing in code what you learned in class in Python. – There were 4 problem sets when I took this course– The hardest is the 1st and as you go they decrease in length and difficulty– Basically just go to 1–3 office hours and you'll be totally fine.[Lectures]:The amount of material you cover is a bit insane but to me that's worth it because it's a bang for your buck.  The Professor is very passionate about the work.  What I recommend doing:– Don't try to jot down everything/scramble.  Instead, understand the intuition while the professor is talking and pointing to things on the slides.  The lectures are recorded and there's already so much math on the screen it's better to understand the main points and write those down than to get bugged in the details.  You can do that later offline.– Have on the side, and especially before the midterm, a \"summary\" note sheet you make as you go along.  It's so useful to do a recap yourself, beyond the recaps the professor does before each and every lecture.[Topics Covered]:Basically the idea of RL is there's an agent and the agent is trying some actions out in its environment, which may/may not change the environment they're in.  The agent has some goal in mind.  The following topics focus on either specific applications/environment setups or ways to help the agent to interact with their environment.– Markov Decision Processes in finite and infinite cases: given some states the environment can be in and some actions the agent can perform, what state and action sequence gives the agent the best reward?– Control: this topic focuses on \"controlling\" or \"balancing\" within a physical environment. how can I get an agent to learn to overcome physical forces?  For example, how do I balance a long pole on a moving cart?– Bandits: given a selection of choices (think a casino slot–machine) with outcomes I don't know, what's the best way to learn so I maximize my reward now AND in the future?  This topic looks at exploration vs exploration of choice.– Learning: all about supervised learning– PG: basically, how volatile are we in getting to the best outcome?  Can we reduce variance in the steps we take to get to the outcome?  We cover things like TRPO, NPG, and PPO.– Miscellaneous: Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning: can we start our agent off by \"learning from another agent\"?",
      "Probably one of the worst courses I have taken, despite the very positive Q–reports it had. The lectures were not engaging in the slightest, there is a focus on statistical proofs rather than any fundamental of reinforcement knowledge, and proofs are taught on slides with details very quickly skipped over, but the expectation that students know them for assessment. You will likely only learn through the final project or potentially the coding portion of the problem sets. The assignment expectations are not clearly communicated and the midterm expectations are not reasonable. Additionally, during the midterm there was constant talking by the professor which disturbed any students who work in silence. On the other hand, there are only 4 assignments, a midterm and a final project so it is not a very heavy course. The OHs are lifesavers in terms of problem sets. Do not recommend this course unless the structure is changed.",

      "This is a pretty interesting course, but it is a difficult one. This was probably one of my favorite courses at Harvard, even though I didn't do too well on the final (sorry Joe). That said, if you're really interested in probability theory, I would definitely recommend taking this course. However, if you're a bit more worried about your grade and time spent on classes, then this might not be the course for you. For context, took this course as an undergrad (senior). Prerequisites: STAT 110 and comfort with proofs. If you have taken a proof–based math course (e.g. Math 22/25/55/112) or a proof–based CS course (CS120/121/124 series or 128), you're probably prepared for the course. There is this question that's posed every year on whether you need real analysis background (Math 112) for this course, but personally I really don't think you need it. It may help as Joe suggests, but you can get through the course and do well without real analysis background. The course also tends to be more probability focused especially on the exams, so I don't think prior experience in real analysis is necessarily super beneficial. So, if you're worried about real analysis, I wouldn't be! You may just need to put a little bit more effort, but there's plenty of students who take this course without having taken real analysis. Joe also makes the real analysis portion of the class pretty self–contained. Homeworks: They're hard, especially the first one on measure theory. They really involve a lot of thinking, which I enjoyed, but it could be time consuming. Exams: Also hard, but there's a lot of practice exams and practice problems in the book, so your performance is typically really based on how much time you spend practicing. Overall, would recommend the course!",
      "Stat 210 is a really interesting continuation of Stat 110 at a slightly more rigorous level and pace. Joe is a very passionate lecturer, so I personally found it enjoyable to attend lectures. This course is more theory–based (although Joe tries to make it accessible to all), and so the first few units of measure theory will be annoying, but after that the content is fun (representations!, MVN, limit theorems, etc...) Exams are difficult, but since they were in–person for the first time this year (as opposed to previous years), Joe does scale the difficulty accordingly. Real analysis also is NOT needed; this was something I was worried about prior to taking the course. It can help, especially with the convergence proofs, but not necessary. The only negative about this course is that solutions to the textbook 'pencil problems' are not readily available (compared to the plethora of Stat 110 solutions available); solutions to the practice final exams were also not given, except for one year's.",

      "When I arrived on campus, I was told by my peers that many analogies could be made between Harvard University and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (from the esteemed Harry Potter Series by J. K. Rowling). Since my bright–eyed, bushy–tailed days as a freshman, I have been aspiring to discover what truly made this correspondence accurate. Is it the archaic–style of the architecture found in the Yard or in Annenberg? Is it the talent and passion of the many professors, lecturers and students? Is it the things people go on to achieve after leaving each respective institution? Is it the comradery and friendships that are nurtured within the school environment and the boarding house system? All of these are certainly candidates for that which we seek, but I alas decided that none of these really nailed home the conjecture I was attempting to prove. In vain, I hence abandoned my quest. However, little did I know, coming into my junior fall, that the needle in the haystack was not only going to reveal itself, but boisterously become a defining feature of my semester – ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I present to you (drumroll, please) 'Wizardry 211: Black Magic with Probability Distributions'.\t`Wait a second, that isn't the title of the course? What happened to \"Stat 211: Statistical Inference I\" ?' you may ask. Well, that is part of the trap, because this is precisely what the course wants you to think it is. It commences unassumingly, with a beautiful first lecture on statistical philosophy and the inferential framework; the first few lectures continue on relatively unassumingly, with excellent motivation and intuition provided in class and beautiful results covered. Then the first problem set lands and you realise the true form of the evil in front of you, and from then on you realise that you are better off trying to purchase the Mirror of Erised to survive the assignments than trying to do them in any reasonable conventional manner (including nitpicking AI generated answers, as helpfully pointed out by Professor Janson). To explain a little bit – maybe it is just the nature of statistical inference research, but a very large number of problems in this course involve a 'come up with a ... that satisfies (insert laundry list) of properties and accomplishes ... task' with very few clues from the lectures, lecture notes or texts that give you a starting point or intuitions on where to proceed with this type of problem, so when you are left to your devices and expected to find out from the (often vague) prompt what exactly it is you have to do it could often feel like you are tasked with performing black magic. Like any good school of magic, Hogwarts has over the years perfected a rigorous curriculum to train its students in various forms of magic, and of course has OWL and NEWT exams in subjects such as Potions (Stat 110), Charms (Stat 111) and even Defence in the Dark Arts (Stat 210) to prepare young wizards and witches from taking on real–world threats – it just unfortunately happens to be the case here that taking on the Stat 211 exams right after successful completion of these three courses is akin to what one would feel like battling Lord Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters fresh out of your NEWTS – while it is the case that there are a few Harry Potters around in the course that are able to survive this monumental task unscathed, there are many who have prepared and understood the content well who horribly fall victim to this terrible slaughtering. I'm all for difficult courses that make you work hard, but I am sure that many would agree that whilst this might be reflective of what statistical inference research feels like, this is not an appropriate way to design assignments and assess students' understanding of material.\tThat being said, this was one of my favourite classes at this school and the best statistics class I have ever taken. Professor Janson is a phenomenal lecturer who teaches with great clarity and rhythm. His lecture notes are equally excellent with a lot of great motivation and intuition given for understanding the tools the class develops and I think coming out of this I finally understood the logical framework of the subject of inference and the big picture of what it is trying to do (in contrast to the absolute mess that was Stat 111 lecture and textbook, absolute night and day difference). I really enjoyed all the topics in the course, but I thought the most well–taught were the areas of non–parametric hypothesis testing and selective inference which I found to have the most interesting and far–reaching consequences; the technicality and rigour was definitely there but not overbearing which was nice as it allowed us to focus on statistical thinking rather than spending more time on real analysis type issues than necessary, while also making sure that what we were doing was correct (unlike in Stat 111). Definitely really really enjoyed it and felt as though it was great at helping me learn.\tSo yes, in conclusion, a course that is both amazing and very very bizarrely run. You will learn a lot from it, but I am not sure how much of the learning (and especially the assessment of how much you have learned) actually comes from the outcome–based aspects of the course. In any case, I will let you make your own judgement on whether you want to do this, and whatever your decision is, I wish you the best of luck.",
      "This class, which is really only for the concurrent masters students and the G1 phds, gets a reputation for being impossibly hard and time–consuming. I think this is a fair baseline. The modifications I would make to this are, starting with the good: 1) Lucas Janson does a pretty good job of giving motivation for concepts, making the lectures worth attending; 2) exams are now 16–hours long and online – this makes them much more doable since you can go for a walk or eat lunch in the middle without worrying about every minute, but it is still incredibly exhausting. Next, the bad, mostly that the psets seem incredibly unmotivated, with convoluted results that are mathematically sound but are neither interesting nor applicable, and with odd degrees of rigor in the sense that measure theory is hand–waved but some other tiny details are rigorously enforced. Overall much better than I expected in the sense that I came in with rock–bottom expectations and only took this course (and still would only take this course) for the AB/SM, but still felt that the lectures were interesting.",

      "This was a really fun class! ~ content ~The content interferes nontrivially with AM250, taught by Y. M. Lu, as was noted in lecture 1. Thus, a student interested in this class can also consult the other (the intersection is *very* large; I would recommend taking one and sitting in the other, and not both). Modern work in probability/statistics focuses frequently in the high–dimensional setting, at least because many algorithms and datasets are such; the material is definitely important! The course covers the following main topics: concentration inequalities (Stein, McDiarmid, Azuma–Hoeffding, Lipschitz Concentration Inequalities, some digression onto isoperimetry, Gaussian Poincare inequality, etc.), Gaussian comparison inequalities (Slepian, Sudakov–Fernique, Gordon, with applications to linear regression via CGMT), Universality (Lindeberg’s principle, etc.), Stein’s Method with Exchangeable Pairs, and a brief excursion into non–asymptotic random matrix theory. The topics are very interesting for anyone who is inspired by the theoretical side of probability/statistics and Professor Sen is a very passionate lecturer who presents the material very cleanly. Results covered range from classical to modern; there is discussion about very old concentration results, as well as several references to modern results, e.g. CGMT is from c. 2015, and more recently, results from Han–Shen on universality (which generalize and relate to the CGMT) are from the previous year (2023). For a partial list of references, see [Boucheron, Lugosi, Massart]: Concentration Inequalities (various sections), [Vershynin]: High–Dimensional Probability (ch. 4); Non–Asymptotic Random Matrix Theory, [Van Handel]: Probability in High Dimension (ch. 5, chaining), [Ross] Fundamentals of Stein’s Method. ~ lecturing ~I have taken a set of notes for the class, but there is not a general set of lecture notes given by the instructor. Class attendance is therefore mandatory. On the other hand, the lecturing is great and very clear, so attending class is enjoyable. ~ HW ~ There are 3 HWs, which range in difficulty. Overall, they largely involved various applications of the techniques already discussed in lecture. There were a few problems involving creativity, such as applying smoothing methods, etc., which were cool; largely, the work was not too difficult. ~ Final Project ~ The final project was quite fun! There was a list of topics and the task was to write an expository paper. The breadth of topics provided was quite large, and the project was very enjoyable! I wrote about a topic in random matrix theory which involved a good amount of reading, but overall learned a lot.",

      "If you're looking for a fairly chill course for the stats masters, I think 242 could be a decent choice, but just accept that you probably won't take away that much from the course. The pros of the course are that it's not that much work, the actual math isn't usually too hard, and the grading was reasonable/lenient. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the course for a while, but I think it ultimately comes down to the fact that Neil tries to cover way too much content but doesn't go deeply enough into any of it. I think the course is generally too theoretical, and I'm not super sure how to use most of the material that we covered. Also, the psets (especially the earlier ones) were not always super clear in terms of what they wanted, so we would often need clarifications in order to do certain problems.",

As regeneration and regrowth is such a new field, it feels essential to not only master previous literature but also ways to explore and expand going forward. The final project is a little bit daunting and expectations aren't very clear from the beginning, but the staff is receptive to feedback. Prof. Macklis can be a bit sassy and self–referential, but he means well and has a vast amount of expertise in research and medical fields. Everything is super interesting, just take good notes!",
      "In the most respectful way possible, this course was hands–down the worst upper–level course I have taken at Harvard. To begin, the syllabus seemingly implies structured lectures, but they were the complete opposite. Macklis unfortunately cannot go on for more than 5–10 minutes without going on an incoherent tangent that never pertains to the material at hand, despite stating he always knows how to get back on track. So much so, that we are often 3–4 lectures behind schedule on the syllabus. When points of confusion arise and you ask a question, he goes on another tangent or rudely cuts you off and never fully answers the question if at all. Everything taught in this class is covered by the developmental unit in NEURO80, so each lecture often feels like a waste of time. Coupled with Macklis' pompous and exceedingly arrogant attitude, this is easily one of the worst classes I have taken. Assignments, \"midterms\", and the final project are relatively straightforward but can feel repetitive and like busy work. Each lecture's readings are unreasonable and unnecessary (many of which are the professor's own work or collaborations), as Macklis rarely touches upon them or discusses their contents. The only \"bright–side\" of this course are: it being over and the sections where you review and learn about new experimental techniques or about revolutionary developmental biology with the TFs.  Save yourself the time, frustration, and boredom and skip this course if it is still available.",

However, we did not stick to the syllabus we created, and several student suggestions were glazed over or skipped entirely in discussion (e.g., \"The Color Purple\").  I understand prioritizing students' health and checking in, but spending half of a 2 hour 45–minute class checking in and out or talking about the merits of the class made me feel like sometimes we went just to chat instead of discussing the readings we wanted to dive into. I also wish Dr. Bell took some agency in the class at times, such as trying to decide a date for the community gathering or providing feedback on our projects (she never saw them because of the structure of the final presentation). This class is very very different and if you do well with limited instructor input or guidance, go for it. If you're a bit more \"type A\", you will find this harder to adjust to.

I felt like I bonded with my fellow students and developed a real understanding of the material from multiple perspectives. I loved this course, and I feel prepared to use the information in other classes. I can not describe what an excellent learning environment this was. Dr. Noll allows you to learn and participate in your own way, as yourself, and I feel as though she truly knows me as a student and a person now. I believe she will have been the teacher who most impacts my view on what it truly means to teach.",
